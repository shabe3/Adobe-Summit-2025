Thank you for joining us today for this session. It's quite excited to have practitioners and leaders, from the written media network space from I took a peek at attendees, companies in the US as well as globally. So thank you for joining us. For what I hope would be an insightful conversation for everyone where we are going to hear the perspective of a retail leader in the admin space, like Dollar General, as well as our own perspective at Adobe as a partner to many in the space.

00:00:34:40 - 00:01:02:02

I am Martha Frattini. I am part of the digital strategy group at Adobe. So what our team does is we partner with, our retail customers across the topics of digital transformation, personalization and scale innovation. I've personally been in retail for a long time. I was at the gap right before joining Adobe, so I have done a little bit of the other side before jumping to the dark side of tech.

00:01:02:07 - 00:01:23:58
不明
Charlene. Shailesh, do you want to introduce yourselves? Absolutely. Hi. My name is Charlene Charles. I lead the network operations for DG Media Network. I've been there about three years, and before that I did roundel a couple other ad tech companies and have been in the CPG space. I'm really excited to be with you all today. And over to Shailesh.

00:01:24:03 - 00:01:48:47
不明
Thanks, Charlene. Hi everyone. I'm Shailesh and I lead digital strategy for commerce Media Networks at Adobe. So let's get started. Celine, I think first, tell us a little bit about Dollar General. Absolutely. Before we get into me saying random factoids about Dollar General, I did just want to ask how many people in here have been to a Dollar General.

00:01:48:52 - 00:02:09:10
不明
Oh, wow. Okay, that's more than I thought, honestly. How many people actually regularly shop there? Okay, a little bit less so. One bonus points for checking out different store formats. And shout out to that one person who actually shops there all the time. So I like to kind of just get a sense of who I'm talking to and how much they maybe already know.

00:02:09:17 - 00:02:34:10
不明
As you can see right now, we serve, a customer that's underserved and very much of a rural America footprint. And we have 20,000 locations. So we're building upwards of almost a thousand stores a year. So it's almost three a day. And we are in rural America. And what that really means is 80% of our stores serve communities that are 20,000 people and less.

00:02:34:15 - 00:03:00:13
不明
So we're really building our stores, and we're in an area where often other retailers don't go or can't go. And we're very much at the heart of rural America. Great. So let's talk a little bit about Dollar General Media Network since its start in 2018. How is it evolved? What sets it apart? Absolutely. Marta, I'll go with the sizzle reel.

00:03:00:17 - 00:03:33:59
不明
Yes. So, yeah, play the sizzle reel.

00:03:34:04 - 00:03:54:31
不明
Thank you. All right. What was the first question that you asked 2018? Yeah. All right. Since we first launched our network, along with a lot of other people who decided they needed a retail media network, we first started actually with someone else running that operation for us. We quickly realized that we need to bring that in-house. Why?

00:03:54:32 - 00:04:25:01
不明
Simply because no one else knows our customer as well as we do. And really, from that point onward, last year we brought everything in-house, fully from all of our endemic and non endemic partners. We focused on expanding our capabilities. Right. So we just started with programmatic audio etc. then we moved into CTV platforms like meta, out-of-home, you name it, really focused on making more meaningful connections for our customers and our brand and advertising partners.

00:04:25:06 - 00:04:52:21
不明
Great. So I think, I mean, 2018, that was early in the story of written media, right? You were really one of the first retailers to launch. Yes. Since then, over the past few years, we have seen an explosion in the market. We have seen, is the fastest growing advertising channel. We have seen about 200 new retail media networks just in 2000, just last year globally.

00:04:52:26 - 00:05:18:17
不明
We are seeing players from outside the retail space entering the retail media space as well, right. Whether that's Chase, Uber, Delta and the likes. So what do you see happen in the space? Sure. I mean, the space has evolved quite a bit ever since we've been, tracking the space. As you mentioned, a lot of these media networks have evolved, spread internationally.

00:05:18:30 - 00:05:43:39
不明
Right. So there are a bunch of, like, macro trends that are taking place, in the industry overall where you're seeing an emergence of media networks and adjacent verticals. Right? So the the travel media networks, the financial media networks internationally, there are additional retailers who are thinking about this and trying to launch their own taking inspiration from what's happening in the United States.

00:05:43:44 - 00:06:13:26
不明
I think we've had our first few leading media networks who've approached us on how to think about launching Non-Pandemic. So a lot of macro trends, but just to keep this real and how it all manifests itself in our day to day lives, right? Like, I've picked four of these trends that you're seeing on the screen right now. First and foremost is retail media networks primarily started as an on site operation, lots of sponsored listings.

00:06:13:31 - 00:06:39:23
不明
And now you're noticing, an emerging trend of expanding into full funnel formats. Right. So you're seeing a lot of off site formats where there is display paid social connected TV. A lot of the advertisers who are working with retail media networks expect their media networks to plan full funnel, not just lower down in the funnel, closer to the transaction.

00:06:39:23 - 00:07:09:16
不明
So that's a major trend that we are seeing evolved. Ever since I would say ChatGPT sprung a surprise. And now when I became a thing, you saw how Adobe evolved. It's it's point of view around gen AI and content generation. Content ideation and production came center stage, right? So so there's been a growing push around being able to offer self-serve capabilities in how to launch creative services.

00:07:09:21 - 00:07:50:10
不明
And you're seeing a whole bunch of like Gen I proliferate in media networks for you to ideate and produce and activate on content, cleaned rooms and merged. Right. MarTech always evolved. And so did we. But the ability to collaborate with advertisers, with publishers, with identity resolution providers, to plan audiences, activate them in a privacy safe, compliant way, and then close the loop on measurement by working with all the parties in an interoperable manner, such that you're not sharing a lot of this data explicitly is a growing trend, which is why I like data collaboration.

00:07:50:11 - 00:08:09:26
不明
Clean rooms. You'll hear a lot of that. A lot of media networks offer their own clean rooms. You'll have a lot of publishers will offer their own clean rooms. There are agnostic providers like Adobe and Live Ramp will offer their own clean rooms like this space is booming, and that's another trend that we noticed. And last but not the least is measurement.

00:08:09:26 - 00:08:33:38
不明
You can never shy away from measurement, right? Because that's the number one reason why advertisers chose to invest in media networks in the first place. But measurement comes in different flavors. And we'll dive into this a little later. But Incrementality is probably the number one metric that is sought after and desired. Everybody wants it. Very few are able to offer that level of measurement.

00:08:33:39 - 00:08:59:44
不明
The ones that do are probably the most successful media networks that are out there. But this is an emerging trend where you're trying to move away from last touch type of metrics or just measuring Roas. Not saying Roas is bad, but just relying solely on Roas is not probably going to get there. But these are the four things that we are noticing in the market right now that is like spreading like fire, along with everything else that I mentioned earlier.

00:08:59:49 - 00:09:22:05
不明
Yeah. And so we talked about how the space is booming and the space is growing and the space is becoming more and more competitive and fragmented in a way. So it's really important for brands who are in the space or are thinking about entering the space to differentiate themselves and offer a differentiated value to the brands that invest in the retail media network.

00:09:22:10 - 00:09:48:16
不明
Which brings me certainly into what is really the first pillar and foundational pillar of another man. Right. Data and audience quality. So tell me a little bit about how do you approach that. What do you think about that first party data is critical. It is essential. It is the lifeblood for any retail media network. Without it, I would argue your your a managed service agency helping provide services.

00:09:48:21 - 00:10:22:17
不明
We have a competitive advantage of 90 million, slightly over of marketable profiles that we can help reach unduplicated access to brands in a way that they they traditionally can't. And so by saying that, it might just sound like I'm saying fluffy words, but in reality, what happened is we partnered with the Trade Desk and looked at the largest third party audience segments 34 to 55 and overlaid our audience because we wanted to validate and confirm that our our audience is an audience.

00:10:22:17 - 00:10:48:39
不明
You can't get over 50% of our audiences against baby food, snacks, toothpaste, you name it. Unduplicated. If National plans with brands out there don't have a Dollar General audience, you're not reaching the total addressable universe of more people that you can engage with and start to build loyalty and so for me, one p data, it's deterministic. It's very much better for targeting.

00:10:48:39 - 00:11:07:10
不明
And you have to have a value and a point of difference that when a brand or an advertiser is asking who do I need to reach? How else can I grow my brand? You? Maybe you're thinking urban areas or different things, but you really have a rural customer that perhaps is overlooked and that is untapped, that you can reach.

00:11:07:15 - 00:11:38:22
不明
Yeah. And the other thing that I think, you guys are doing differently than others is we have worked over the past couple of years to kind of bring together the world, marketing audiences and retail media audiences on Adobe Experience platform and really bridging the gap between the customer experience management side of the house and the retail media side of the house, which I think is something that is still often very siloed in companies.

00:11:38:27 - 00:12:05:22
不明
Tell a little bit about what wins, what efficiencies this has unlocked for you. Yes. There are three things I just want to hit on. The first one is more seamless engagements between paid and owned. That's driving efficiencies. And for every retail retail, marketing enterprise dollars we're investing, we're able to see a stronger ROI that extends further to the DG media network as well, because we can suppress audiences or complement efforts.

00:12:05:32 - 00:12:29:32
不明
So no matter where a customer is in their journey, they're having a relevant experience. If it's from the enterprise side or if it's from the advertiser side. The second big thing is our retargeting efforts. This one's really fun. If we see someone only opening up an email once a month, or we only see them engaging with us in a limited way, we're able to essentially create many test and different opportunities to see how can we increase our engagement with them?

00:12:29:47 - 00:12:52:10
不明
How can we get one more touchpoint? How can we build stronger loyalty? And the third one is around automation and time savings. So we got all of our campaigns, success metrics and our customer data into CJA. And then from there we were also able to work with agile on automating all of the journeys. So are email or paid media are circular?

00:12:52:24 - 00:13:11:50
不明
It really helped us save a lot of time because previously we did all of those actions kind of in a siloed fashion, and we weren't really able to fully personalize, and we were probably duplicating a lot of efforts and and wasting some money as well. Yeah. And then the other side of the data coin. Right. Measurement, measurement.

00:13:11:50 - 00:13:42:57
不明
I think it's it's a challenge. It's a really important thing. And it's also challenging retailer retail in general as a space. And it's even harder in the retail media network space. So as you mentioned before, measurement. Right. So tell us a little bit more about that. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, as I mentioned, the number one reason why retail media networks became successful and advertisers choose to work with media networks has always been measurement.

00:13:42:57 - 00:14:06:27
不明
Right? I mean, you'll be it would be misleading to believe that it's about inventory and it's about value added services. No, but it's the promise of how you can close the loop. So so measurement is always, a critical topic. But that being said, anyone who's closely followed this, the space which is measurement is it's not new and unique to retail media networks.

00:14:06:32 - 00:14:27:41
不明
A lot of it just has to do with plain and basic marketing measurement or paid media measurement. Right? It's it's difficult right there. We all know top down bottoms up approaches. But the spectrum is very different. But in order to distill this, like if I had to advise a media network in terms of like, what's the ideal package that you had to offer?

00:14:27:46 - 00:14:57:46
不明
First and foremost. Right. You, of course, need your reports from each platform that help you understand how each of your placements and how each of your like, marketing investments are working by platform and by channel. And then you need a consolidated view, not yet duped and attributed. That's going to come later, but at the very least, you need a single performance report that gives you a clear picture of where you're spending, what are you delivering, and what's the type of engagement that you're noticing?

00:14:57:59 - 00:15:17:23
不明
Right. Once you have that nailed down, that's when you get into attribution type of reporting, right? Is how far can you take attribution. And we all know there are channels like paid social, for example, where you will never be able to merge it with display media on site just because you don't have that level of granular information.

00:15:17:23 - 00:15:47:04
不明
So that's always going to reside on the site, but where you can, which is when you're working with your DSPs and your on site platforms, you will be able to dedupe it. So multi-touch attribution, the ability to arrive, derive, the appropriate credit to each touch. That's another thing that you want to add in your repository. And then you're always going to have channels that you offer that do not produce the type of granular data that supports multi-touch attribution.

00:15:47:04 - 00:16:03:16
不明
Right? So in that case, you will need to augment it with some sort of like a regression based or an type of methodology, provided you have the data. Right. Doesn't work when you have like two months of data, it's only going to work when you have years and years of data. So like think 1 to 3 years.

00:16:03:21 - 00:16:34:48
不明
But these are the three things that you want to start with. And then from there again the number one reason that you want to measure your effectiveness is incrementality. Right. And and these methods are going to differ. You'll be able to launch like geo based testing. You'll be able to launch holdout testing. These methodologies widely vary, but at the very least, the ability for you to measure incrementality and proving the incremental value of what you are driving is going to be extremely important.

00:16:34:53 - 00:17:02:22
不明
And once you have all of these different reporting methodologies and approaches and KPIs sorted out, then you want to offer something more, right? The ability to understand what audiences are going to deliver additional value. Because ultimately, as a media network, you also want to figure out how you're going to drive incremental investment for your own media network. And that's not going to come through unless you offer some value added service.

00:17:02:22 - 00:17:32:08
不明
So which audiences are performing better? Which ones they didn't target, that they could have targeted better? Providing those type of insights is going to be extremely important. And as I mentioned earlier, with the proliferation of AI, you will be able to measure all the techno graphic attributes of a creative asset, right? So this is not just about measuring creative and ad server metrics, not just engagement, but you will know precisely which attributes of a creative asset can be dissected.

00:17:32:13 - 00:17:57:48
不明
And then measure the efficacy and importance of each of those creatives to then determine what do you want to launch in market. Right. So it's not a one size fits all. There are there are lots of things that you need to add in order to like nail down measurement to its core. There are some aspects of like viewability and whatnot I haven't even like touched upon, but at least from a measurement perspective, this is the entire portfolio that I would recommend you strongly consider.

00:17:57:48 - 00:18:08:56
不明
Whether you're an advertiser who's investing in a media network or a retailer who's launching a media network. That's it.

00:18:09:01 - 00:18:27:23
不明
I would love to hear your perspective, though, because I mean, you know, CBS news added you and then you do have, closed loop measurement as one of your key features and the ability to report value back to the brands. You've got to measure closed loop measurement. We provide that. We also worked with you all to do randomized holdouts.

00:18:27:23 - 00:18:48:09
不明
So we can also deliver Incrementality and I Roas. You know, it's daunting to hear you talk about everything. And it's also triggering because you know, you've got you've got brands, you have them investing and every campaign every time, every client, they have goals, they have metrics, they have things they need to hit and deliver and prove so they can get reinvestment.

00:18:48:14 - 00:19:08:19
不明
And it is a fun problem to solve creatively with the audiences and the creatives and the tactics. But there's so many moving pieces and there's so many elements that can be analyzed or something else can get credit for it. And so it's a fun little Rubik's Cube that we we engage with our clients to make sure that we understand every time what their outcomes are.

00:19:08:23 - 00:19:33:54
不明
But, it's it's also the way that you validate and inform that you're delivering true value, right? Without measurement. And some retail media networks still don't provide I roas, which blows my mind. You've got to really lead that transparency there, especially as our industry just becomes more and more of a full funnel brand and performance tactic that brands look to invest in.

00:19:33:59 - 00:19:54:10
不明
Yeah, absolutely. And you have both touched in different but similar ways on Incrementality. So across the live general, not just your retail media network, we have done quite a bit of work together to help prove that. Incrementality how is that going? I'm actually going to share how the DG media networks going, because I can't share how everything else is going.

00:19:54:10 - 00:20:17:52
不明
But it is exciting and it makes me very happy to share with you all that for the last year. So the last 12 calendar months, our average IRA has for our brands is $4.51. That's on our measurable media channels are Roas is nearly nine, and around 35% of customers who convert are new to brand that were featured in the creative.

00:20:17:52 - 00:20:41:52
不明
And so it's very exciting when you really do have the right audiences and you show up in the right channels with them, you can measure those performance outcomes to make sure you can go back to your brand and say, look, you actually get return every time. Hopefully. Sometimes that doesn't happen, though, to woo hoo. And the results. I'm going to switch gears a little bit and talk about formats.

00:20:41:52 - 00:21:03:01
不明
So, one of the things that you certainly do at Dollar General is you have quite a variety, breadth and depth of formats online and offline. How do you think about the role that the different channels and formats play? Aren't you going to go to the next slide to. Oh, there. Oh, you just looked at me and you did at that time.

00:21:03:01 - 00:21:27:08
不明
Okay. All right. Formats plays such a big role when you think about a retail media network and how most of them came to fruition, everyone started on site first, right? We actually started with off site. And the reason is because initially when we launched, we didn't have an ability to convert online. And most importantly, we wanted to go where our customers are and our customers are on YouTube.

00:21:27:08 - 00:21:53:31
不明
Consuming content. They are on the open web, they are on Instagram. And so we took what I like to say that harder step first to reach them offsite, to then encourage them to take action. Buy things in store now on a format perspective, this is a beautiful little example of what we call DG story ads, and we're constantly thinking of new ways to innovate on our site and have more meaningful experiences for our customers.

00:21:53:36 - 00:22:17:09
不明
And these are doing great. We are seeing three times the redemption on coupons whenever we have this kind of ad play for them, and we're also just seeing the benefits of our digitally engaged customer. They're 3.6 more, they're spending 3.6 more than a non engaged customer. And every time that they're in app or if they're on our website, they're going to our store 50% of the time.

00:22:17:09 - 00:22:37:01
不明
Within two days, we have 70% of our customers going into our store within 14 days. And so formats are so important. You need to show up in all of these ways relevantly and also feel organic to that experience. So then whenever they're doing things, it feels fun. We're helping them save time, save money. They're building their shopping list.

00:22:37:06 - 00:22:55:48
不明
They're actually looking at how much is my basket going to cost. So when they go into the store, they can afford it all because sometimes they're cash strapped. And so when you think about coupon clipping and all of the value you can give to a customer, it's a good feeling. And that's exactly what we're trying to do with things like DG stories.

00:22:55:53 - 00:23:22:26
不明
Yeah. I'd love actually highlight your perspective as well, because of course you see a lot of different archetypes across the universe. You better say you like our format. No, I absolutely I do, I do because as I said, that's that's where that's where you'll find your consumers for the most part. But let's, let's take a step back right on this, which is, retail media networks traditionally have launched in multiple different archetypes.

00:23:22:31 - 00:23:48:49
不明
You, you have like the Amazons and the best buys that do have the luxury to monetize their on site inventory, because they do attract a sizable amount of traffic on their website. Have a sizable e-commerce operation. So these are the types of media networks that are like your full fledged media networks, which is they will monetize your first party audiences, they will monetize your dot.com inventory, and they will offer extensions into off site.

00:23:48:53 - 00:24:11:43
不明
Right. And then you have some others who don't have a sizable amount of, e-com or ecom traffic, and they choose to start with off site first. Right? And even when they launch on site, there is a ceiling to it, and most of their operation will still reside into offsite. And then there's another archetype here, which is, what Amazon and probably best buy it.

00:24:11:43 - 00:24:33:47
不明
Right. Like Best Buy partners with seen that today do offer an extension into publisher inventory, which allows them to serve ads and still run ads at a high margin. Amazon offers something similar, which is they have IMDb, they have Twitch, right. These are all properties they acquire outside of what they are able to offer to then monetize a lot of that inventory.

00:24:33:52 - 00:25:07:07
不明
And this is where a lot of these ad formats come into place, right? Ad formats, of course, we do want a lot of video. We want to see a lot of like CTV inventory, but then the ability to extend that in the form of reviews on your website about certain particular products, the ability to show instructional videos, the ability to then extend a lot of that content into additional inventory, right, that the number of ad formats that are emerging by the second in each media network is massive.

00:25:07:11 - 00:25:31:41
不明
But for the most part, it all resides within video, within, offsite. And then from there, you tend to expand into some other formats that are most effective. Yeah. We have talked a lot about written media up until now, and one thing is written media shouldn't live in a silo, right? It's still it's still part of a brand.

00:25:31:46 - 00:25:52:04
不明
So at Dollar General, how do you think about that? Like, what is the role of retail media network in the context of your brand digital and your total experience? I do think every retail media network does start in a silo. It usually starts as a strategic initiative, and it's a small little Swat team, and you kind of have to prove your way to your worth.

00:25:52:04 - 00:26:16:35
不明
And so there's this natural silo because everyone's wondering what's happening, right? This team is growing. Something's happening. Finance cares about them now. So there's that component. And it hits that tipping point where all of a sudden you need to become integrated. And not every retailer can do that. It depends on how the structure is set up. It depends on the existing legacy silos that have nothing to do with retail media.

00:26:16:40 - 00:26:40:38
不明
At Dollar General, what's really exciting is we're a leaner team, like we have less people and that makes our structure a bit more flat. We also have retail media, enterprise marketing and all of our digital within the same house. So we're under one person, our chief marketing officer, and we sit in the merchant pillar. And what I love about that is everything is in service of something else.

00:26:40:38 - 00:27:07:22
不明
Like we are all doing the work that we're trying to do, seasonal activations, we're trying to meet merchant objectives, and we're doing everything with an enterprise led effort. Then that translates to the best in class digital experience, right? And we're we're launching delivery, our E-Comm and our in-store. Both arms are talking to each other. That leads you to kind of like the last part of that flywheel, which is the DG Media Network.

00:27:07:33 - 00:27:30:52
不明
If you're doing those things right, you're generating more traffic in store, you're garnering more sales out of total box level, and then you're able to take that larger audience, more identified people, more traffic and eyeballs on your website to brands and advertisers to say, how can we deliver you incremental return? How can we make your specific brand grow?

00:27:31:04 - 00:27:52:17
不明
Having that strategic kind of, through line with all is one of the big benefits. If you're not siloed, it just makes everything easier. And I would argue it's really hard to do that. Especially whenever, you know, if you've launched earlier or later or just how teams are set up. It's usually not all in one house. Yeah.

00:27:52:17 - 00:28:13:51
不明
And, you touched on the fact that many start in a silo and it's often lean teams. Right. And that's not surprising. It's not like retail media is the core business of a retailer or a brand to begin with. Right? So Lean Teams is often the situation, unless you had a giant, which brings me I'd love to hear both of your perspective.

00:28:13:51 - 00:28:34:06
不明
I'll probably start, which I like, but how can retailers and brands really efficiently maximize this opportunity here? Yeah, I mean, I think that's a good one because I think let's let's get down to the basics. Right. So so if you want to launch a retail media network and I'll start with the tech first, because tech is not the only answer.

00:28:34:06 - 00:28:53:43
不明
You need a lot more beyond tech to be successful. But at least from a technology standpoint, first and foremost is you need to have a very strong foundation around your first party data, right. Retail media network is going to exceed 100 billion at some point. That's all on the basis of first party data. That's why. Right.

00:28:53:43 - 00:29:20:23
不明
So the ability to have a very strong data foundation, which is the ability to create unique audiences for different combinations of recency and frequency by different categories, by subcategories, by all the advertisers that you tend to engage with. It's a massive operation, right? And unless you don't nail that portion, there is no media network out there, right? That your media network is not scaling.

00:29:20:23 - 00:29:46:48
不明
So I would say like that's the first and foremost thing that you need to nail down. And and when you think about like the advancements the space is making, the ability now to collaborate and invite additional partners like a publisher or another advertiser or just another brand to help build and plan these audiences. It's the number one thing that you need to stand up effectively.

00:29:46:53 - 00:30:11:21
不明
Next is, content, right? You can't ignore content. Even if you have audiences, you still need to go out there and share some great engaging formats. I think Charlene had some amazing examples to share earlier. That just doesn't happen. Like offhand, there's a lot of effort that goes into it. But with AI, you can now significantly accelerate the timeline associated with creating some of these engaging ad formats.

00:30:11:21 - 00:30:43:53
不明
So content is another pillar that you want to master. Ad products will always be something that will be a vehicle that you choose to then monetize your ability to marry data with content right? Which means you will have different ad formats like a sponsored listings ad format or display banners on your website. You will expand into offsite inventory, whether it's CTB inventory, whether it's online video, whether it's paid social, that sort of inventory that is available for you to monetize will remain endless.

00:30:43:58 - 00:31:01:15
不明
But the more you offer where you are, consumers are where you want to go meet them. That is another pillar that you want to offer. And last but not the least, is the ability to measure a lot of this effectively. Right? So I'm not going to go too deep because I just spent a minute or so earlier trying to explain everything around measurement.

00:31:01:20 - 00:31:34:58
不明
But if you aren't able to measure like incremental Roas or you aren't able to measure Incrementality, if you aren't able to offer those insights that your advertiser is seeking as a result of launching those campaigns, you're not going to end up being successful, right? So at least from a tech standpoint, I would highly, highly advise you look into these four pillars and then there is a very specific thing that Charlene mentioned earlier, which is the entire media network operation requires a dedicated support mechanism.

00:31:34:58 - 00:31:54:50
不明
Right. Like this. It cannot survive if it doesn't have its own PNL. At this point in time, yes, marketing and media networks will integrate at some point, because now media networks are larger than life, and everyone is paying attention to it. But in order to even start and be successful at it, it will need its own PNL.

00:31:54:50 - 00:32:22:57
不明
It's its own value added services. It's own set of like resourcing that will help you launch it and be successful. Because there are tons of media networks out there that aren't successful because they don't have this level of dedication. Right. So that's a key area that I want you to, like, recognize as part of the journey that Charlene described earlier, it's extremely important how you nurture a media network and grow into a successful one, like they have.

00:32:23:02 - 00:32:43:31
不明
Yes. You also have to keep it easy. I joke about the easy button, and I think we've all used that little jiff in a PowerPoint before. But if there's so many networks, we've all seen that chart to where it shows over the years and everyone's someone's on LinkedIn. There's 275 networks that launched yesterday. There's always someone launching something.

00:32:43:31 - 00:33:09:18
不明
And it's so important that when an advertiser or a brand has an opportunity to invest a dollar, they look to you to say, you help me, you make it easier. You're either offering more ways for me to engage in buy through self-service and managed. You're either giving me creative support or basically working in a more consultative versus transactional fashion to help meet me my meet my goals.

00:33:09:23 - 00:33:35:49
不明
Or you're giving reports in a self-service way or API and data sharing so they can come see the results, not wait after an attribution window in an end of campaign report, you have to make it where they look to you to help solve their problems. Because without doing that, advertisers have choice. And with all these networks launching, there's just not enough capacity for them to figure out how to execute with each one of them.

00:33:35:54 - 00:34:00:15
不明
People have to do things that are in service of making their lives easier. Yeah. So we so many written media networks continuing to launch. Let's let's maybe close with an eye to the future. Right. Can you foresee the future? What do you see in the future? What's ahead? So I guess, just everything you mentioned, everything I mentioned.

00:34:00:15 - 00:34:21:50
不明
Definitely. Definitely. But that's a thing of the past, right? That's why I mentioned it. No, I think I think there's an interesting development overall in the space, which is you heard a lot about what we had to announce in our keynote, which is AI agents. Right? So a lot of a lot of what you're going to see in future is, okay, now, what should I do?

00:34:21:50 - 00:34:46:55
不明
And are you able to advise what I should be doing from a media network standpoint? Right. Like the site optimizer example that we shared this morning, it instantly will tell you where your mistakes are on the site and will offer you recommendations on how to fix it. So I think one area that you're going to see a lot of, noise around is how can I agents now accelerate your media network offerings?

00:34:47:00 - 00:35:10:24
不明
Right. So that's one thing that you can look forward to. I'm looking forward to it to figure out like how it comes to fruition. And the second one is around self-serve, right? Self-serve was always sought and desired for. But I would say media networks were early in their infancy stages to master it. But now that they've they have a craft around it, they they mastered it.

00:35:10:24 - 00:35:33:39
不明
They've been in operation for a while. There are tools in the market that will help you serve the long tail. That's another area that I'm looking forward to determine, like who will lead the pack. So those two definitely. And what's ahead for you at Dollar General? I don't know if any of y'all listened to our earnings report the other day, but it's so exciting that we are truly becoming an omnichannel retailer.

00:35:33:39 - 00:36:03:44
不明
So we've had a successful partnership with the DoorDash, 16,000 plus stores across the US. But we've piloted a small test last September of around 3 or 400 stores, and it's working fabulously for DG delivery, and we are going to be in 10,000 stores by the end of 2025. And what's fantastic about this is we are seeing a larger average order size as well as just we're seeing it's saving people time.

00:36:03:57 - 00:36:37:24
不明
So because of our real estate footprint, we are able to get to our customers even faster than other delivery same day options. And so that's that's what we're most excited about. I mean, our clients have been asking for this with the network to be able to say, we know you guys have figured out offsite and how to get people to go and store, being able to really have E-Com as a bigger part of our retail media offering, is really unlocking some budgets and having some more productive conversations with brands who are like, okay, we're taking you a lot more serious on this.

00:36:37:24 - 00:37:00:59
不明
So that's what I'm most excited about. That is exciting. Yes. Okay. So that's it in terms of the questions I have, but I'd love maybe for both of you before we open it up for more questions to close with. What are a couple of 2 to 3 like your big takeaways from today's conversation that you would like to leave people with?

00:37:01:04 - 00:37:31:32
不明
Am I good? Do you want me to go first? Okay. All right. Mine aren't game changing crazy things. Mine are pretty basic, but I think it's important. First and foremost, you've got to continue innovating, whether that's through platforms, products, channels, partnerships, you name it. More immersive marketing. Bless you. More immersive marketing experiences are just becoming more critical for how a brand thinks that they're going beyond just generating erros and also building loyalty.

00:37:31:36 - 00:38:03:03
不明
An example I can give you is we recently announced a partnership with an organization called recess. They do peer to peer sampling. That's something five years ago, we just wouldn't have considered. These are people in your community giving out samples of products at schools, universities, you're shopping malls, soccer games, you name it. People are looking for trusted sources of truth and you've just got to keep innovating and finding those new ways and making sure that advertisers want to engage with you.

00:38:03:08 - 00:38:27:14
不明
The second big thing, and it's kind of what you hit on in general, but transparency in regards to measurement, I think is huge. You can't you can't lie your way out of these things. Gone are the days of just a lot of impressions and fun click through rates. And this one did better than that. You actually need to demonstrate real value and share growth and or incremental return or lifetime value.

00:38:27:14 - 00:38:49:17
不明
And so I just see transparency becoming a bigger part from everything around CPMs and pricing and how that works. Right. For a managed service business, all of that is going to come together for people to understand transparently what measurement really means and what gets baked into it. So those are two of my big takeaways. Do you approve? Yeah, absolutely.

00:38:49:17 - 00:39:17:29
不明
No I'm kidding. No, no, I know I think those are those are really good ones. Right. I think from my perspective, I would say watch out for what we have to offer from a collaboration standpoint, because I think clean rooms have existed from a measurement perspective. But the ability to plan audiences effectively and identify where precisely to activate, which is the same point you are making earlier, you should find where my consumers are, right?

00:39:17:29 - 00:39:42:53
不明
Which is why you chose to launch offsite first before on site, I think. I think that's an interesting evolution and a key takeaway that I would like everyone to remember. And the other one is around self-serve, right? Is, it'll come. It'll become more prominent, especially as additional media networks launch as they try to, like, sift through the competition as you openly maybe consider launching non endemics.

00:39:42:53 - 00:40:04:04
不明
So I think that's that's a key one. And last but not the least is watch out for our Dollar General Media network. Right. I would have never known they have 90 million profiles. Honestly. When you think about it from a US population perspective, that's still one third of the overall U.S. marketable population. And it's not just everything about Walmart and Amazon.

00:40:04:04 - 00:40:29:03
不明
You have media networks like Dollar General who can offer a great bang for your buck. So watch out for them and watch out for all the capabilities they want to launch in future. I didn't even pay you for that. That wasn't on our original script either. He just infused that in. I love that. So we're gonna wrap up the session, but I think you can still walk up, like if you want to chat with Shailesh or Celine, they're available, right?

00:40:29:05 - 00:40:35:09
不明
Or we can order Running Away. Yeah. Okay, great. Thanks, everyone. Thank you very much. Thank you.
