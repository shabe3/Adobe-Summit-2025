00:00:00:52 - 00:00:34:48
不明
All of us believe the the growing importance of AI and the the bigger role the AI's playing their day in, day out in terms of the the various use cases and the various scenarios coming out. And it's going to be very important for the brands to strike a balance between the AI powered automations and the human insights. So how do you balance it for a specific use case specific scenarios and deliver the value, right.

00:00:34:53 - 00:01:02:35
不明
So I think, with that, just want to start with, so Ron, again with you, because, the more and more the AI involvement in terms of the customer interactions. So how do you ensure, particularly from, investment management perspective, giving a human touch, empathy and also a, more comfort to the investors?

00:01:02:40 - 00:01:23:45
不明
It's not about the machine. There's the human touch, is there? Right? I think last year we really thought human in the loop would solve for this. I think the pace of change, in particular in the AI space, is so fast that we've probably moved past that. And we found out the models are super smart. You can train them to do more than you think you can.

00:01:23:45 - 00:01:52:07
不明
Right? And so, in selling Valerie earlier, we're using internal call transcripts to train the model how to say, sound and act more like Vanguard. Right? Are our employees that are on the phones, go through extensive training around, not only financial products and sort of, advice, but also just, you know, how to live and breathe the vanguard ethos of invest for the long term, stay the course, you know, and don't don't panic at market sell offs and things like that.

00:01:52:12 - 00:02:11:22
不明
So we're using other bodies of knowledge we already have in the company to help inform the gen AI models in terms of like the voice of Vanguard. I think the other thing we're doing is a lot of test and learn, right? So, you know, we've we found the first projects we did with Gen AI. They hallucinated tremendously.

00:02:11:22 - 00:02:28:19
不明
Right. And so you have to come up with more of the guardrails that you want to put in place. A lot of our thinking around a genetic AI is sort of a distributed set of agents, and one of them might be a compliance type agent. One of them might be sort of the voice of Vanguard type agent. Right.

00:02:28:19 - 00:02:47:51
不明
So you can get back the response from the generated answer, but then we send it through sort of another couple of layers in the modeling to make sure that it's not going to violate, requirements around compliance or to make sure that it sounds very authentic, as if someone was speaking to a Vanguard crew member.

00:02:47:56 - 00:03:12:31
不明
Thank you. I think we've made some excellent points in terms of how do we balance the humanity. Yeah, and that's very important in shaping the future of experience. When it comes to the hotel industry, Valerie, I think, as part of the guest experience, the more and more involvement in terms of leveraging AI, whether it's, recommendation or personalized, interactions.

00:03:12:36 - 00:03:36:34
不明
So how do we ensure the more personal touch is not lost as part of the more and more automation of the AI? So what is the strategy being adopted or being explored with them? Yeah, obviously for for hospitality, there's always going to be that human interaction. And I don't think that'll ever go away. Maybe for some of us that perhaps don't want to talk to someone at the front desk, that's fine.

00:03:36:34 - 00:03:59:40
不明
But there's still many that that do want to have that. And I think, you know, when you look at the data around how people are using AI, a lot of it is informational at the moment. Especially in the SEO space, when you think of the AI overviews and just what those are doing, I think I saw a stat that 95% of those are informational and only 4% are transactional at the moment.

00:03:59:40 - 00:04:19:53
不明
So at the end of the day, we're still a business that that needs to transact and do those types of things. So getting specific about where are the right places that we can use AI to be a benefit to a customer to aid them, to help them do things that perhaps may feel hard or have been challenging in the past.

00:04:19:53 - 00:04:42:56
不明
And then when are those moments where we just don't want to leverage a tool like AI? Maybe it's something on property where we'd rather that they're interacting with our front desk staff or something like that. So using it carefully in that regard and really having those discrete use cases around where are the right moments to do this, and where are the moments where it might feel a little off.

00:04:43:01 - 00:05:11:35
不明
Thank you. Thanks, Valerie. So, Michelle, coming to the travel industry, I think, it's not just about moving from yet to be the location, right, in terms of, of the communication, in terms of timely, relevant communication. And there how are you balancing and leveraging AI with the human insights to deliver the seamless experience, elevated experience for the travelers?

00:05:11:40 - 00:05:34:46
不明
Yeah, I think we we it's clear that we we need both. And I think we can, focus really on the operational communication. That's the most important part in, in this story, if you go back a few years, let's say, we have had some purchase data available that we can base ourselves on, and we already have seen major improvements on on something.

00:05:34:51 - 00:06:00:58
不明
Yeah, simple, like opening rates of an email going from, from 30% to 70 or 80% or higher. So we're on the good on good track with AI will really need to help us to really be there at the right time. Like I mentioned before, using the purchase data but also scan data, also dual localization that we're going to start using with, with AD, you to be really there when the customer customer needs us.

00:06:01:03 - 00:06:23:02
不明
When you see, five years ago, we had a one size fits all. If there's an issue on the, on the, on the network, we're going to send email to everybody. Not a good idea. So we avoided that. Only in case of major. Major problems. And then we started to learn along the way. And we're still growing and growing.

00:06:23:16 - 00:06:46:05
不明
And the most important and difficult part is to give you an idea. Belgium. I know it's really small. It's a really small company. And we have 3007 trains approximately rolling each day, more than 300 stations. But if there's a problem in one upper right corner of Belgium, it could have an impact on. Yeah, really in the south of Belgium.

00:06:46:10 - 00:07:09:18
不明
So it's really trying to understand what the impact of a disruption is. And that's really something that a human cannot simply define. When working. Like we were working today with a human point of view. You take the rail network, you see, okay. These stations. Okay. Let's take that one for, for the segment. But it's really much more broader than than that.

00:07:09:18 - 00:07:43:34
不明
And that's where we are really using AI to do, want to create that optimal, audience for that type of, of communication. Thank you. That's insightful. I think this question is to all of you, with the growing, importance of AI and the role and the overall human and the AI ecosystem, how the brand should evaluate building the trust of the customers, because trust is the the important thing when you have a ecosystem of humanity.

00:07:43:39 - 00:08:02:33
不明
So any view on specific to your brands, building a trust with the customers? I think for us it's been I never thought I would talk so much about data. I started out when, 14 years ago as a content writer, and it's not my love language, but getting that data right to build the trust. So, you know, for me, my husband and I don't have kids.

00:08:02:38 - 00:08:33:45
不明
If you're showing me a image of a hotel with a pool, with lots of kids on the water slides and everything, maybe not so much. Now, if you have the a champagne bottle on the bed ready to go, I'm in. But really just getting to know the customer and making sure that the data is in a place where again, we're sending the right message and not sending messages or over blasting things that that don't feel personal, that don't feel relevant for us, that's been really important to get that part right.

00:08:33:50 - 00:08:55:43
不明
And I think in addition to do that, also what you said earlier, the human contact is also really important. They have the combination of both. You can have a chat, but also looking into okay, can an agent help in our in our chatbot to further optimize. But you really have to have the impression that there's always a human there to to help you if if needed.

00:08:55:47 - 00:09:17:11
不明
Yeah, yeah. I think authenticity is really a big part of it. Right. So again, don't show up like one of our competitors when you're, you know, using AI, we we do not support crypto at Vanguard. Right? We just do not believe in it as an investment vehicle. There are underlying reasons we don't we don't support gold funds either for the same reason.

00:09:17:11 - 00:09:38:17
不明
Right. We feel that there is no intrinsic value being created by those products. And so as a company, we don't do that. So it would be bizarre if our AI started recommending crypto products to our clients. So some of it is being authentic to the company and the brand, some of it's sort of getting the insights into our investment philosophy.

00:09:38:22 - 00:10:03:31
不明
You know, again, as I said, we're using our knowledge base to train some of the agents to sort of seem more authentically Vanguard. So I think all of those are really important, but it's establishing that trust, it's showing up in those moments that doesn't feel creepy, but feels sort of informed and authentic in the way that, you know, any of us can have an experience with a company, but if they show up at the right time and are talking to you about things that are relevant for you, it's super impactful, right?

00:10:03:39 - 00:10:26:58
不明
If everyone in this room knows a brand that you that when you say, tell me a brand that really gets you right, whoever that is, whatever kind of company that is, you know, those companies, you also know the inverse of that. That is like the creepy company that shows up all over whatever your social feeds are or your, you know, websites that you go to and you see the same terrible ad 15 times just because.

00:10:26:58 - 00:10:52:27
不明
So they can get impressions, right. You know, the two sides of that. So I think it's really being true to the mission of the company being authentic in the way that you treat your clients and then showing up in the in those ways. Yeah. Thank you. I think it was very insightful. And it also, refers to the art, accountability, responsibility and transparency that's very important in building that trust.

00:10:52:31 - 00:11:20:33
不明
So with that, I think, we'll move on to the next section. Navigating the AI journey while all of us nauseous. This is the industry specific use case. Scenario, how we can reimagine with the AI and, how we can orchestrate the AI tools and your, you know, technologies to deliver a business value and how we can, harmonize the.

00:11:20:38 - 00:11:54:24
不明
Yeah, and the human ecosystem while all of the things are defined, still, there are challenges with organizations in navigating the AI transformation journey. So there are few examples where, brands are struggling in terms of data readiness, legal and, security compliance and, the employee readiness, the talent availability and employee readiness. So overall, the adoption is another challenge the brands are evaluating.

00:11:54:28 - 00:12:14:08
不明
So I'm just trying to understand from your brand perspective, how the the company is, navigating the journey in the context of data readiness, legal security and the employee readiness, the overall adoption of it. Yeah.

00:12:14:13 - 00:12:40:28
不明
Start with maybe get on. Yeah, sure. You know, so data is an interesting thing, right? A lot of people talk about is your data ready? Large language models need readable content, right? So if you wrote your API with, camel Case as an example, and you use, you know, ADR one ADR to for address, one in address to an alarm doesn't really know what that is right now.

00:12:40:28 - 00:13:02:27
不明
It can start to intuit that. But what we found is we've we've had to go back and augment API's with more sort of metadata tags, if you will, so that the LLM has better context in terms of what those generated solutions are trying to do. Right. So that's one thing. So it's not just data readiness I think data readiness is like we're going to talk about that till the end of time I think.

00:13:02:27 - 00:13:28:43
不明
But but it's then how do you use the data in the context of which you want the AI to use it most effectively? So, you know, we've had to go back and augment our APIs so that the LMS understand sort of the what we're trying to get them to do. I, you know, I think the other thing is really, we are fortunate we have a CEO and a CIO who are both very open about AI will change the way we do business.

00:13:28:48 - 00:13:54:45
不明
And so from the top down, we have a pretty strong edict, if you will, that we need to become AI ready, right. All of our competitors are probably already doing this. We need to be as well. And it's empowering, right? We do have a lot of people who are afraid of it. Right. But I think the thing that is, is most sort of impactful is if you can get yourself to, how can we or what could we do in terms of a mindset?

00:13:54:50 - 00:14:12:30
不明
I think that starts to pivot you into the potential and the possibilities of so many things, like just compliance, right? How could you use AI to get 10,000 images approved versus one lawyer? That's never going to be able to do that, right? So I mean, the potential is all over the place. It's not it's not just in personalized digital experiences.

00:14:12:30 - 00:14:39:08
不明
It's it's all of our processes have opportunity. So I think we're excited about that. And we have really strong advocacy from the leaders. Thank you. Thanks for letting me. Yeah. Theron mentioned the executive buy in. And I think that's critical as well. When you have someone that's championing for the things that could really either help an employee or accelerate the business or of course, drive more revenue overall for the company.

00:14:39:09 - 00:15:03:32
不明
So when we first started down the I'll call it the AI journey, the organization did put together a steering committee that encompassed a lot of different groups across the organization to start looking at where are the places where this feels right, where are the places that perhaps we need more time to vet things out, and just having some really firm wins early on helped.

00:15:03:43 - 00:15:33:39
不明
I think a lot of people here AI and they think, oh, you're just going to spin out all this content, it's not going to make sense. It's going to be the creepy ads following you, but then seeing some of the things like copilot like you mentioned, or even just some of the ways we've been able to author across all of our brands and at velocity has really helped to to sell the story that it doesn't have to be this scary thing that's taking, again, taking away jobs or anything like that, but that there's real discrete use cases that we can use.

00:15:33:39 - 00:15:54:33
不明
And I mean, we're excited with journey orchestration. I'll admit, I never thought as an organization that that we would get there as far as the ways that we are going to personalize across all channels, but being able to see the benefit through things like our contact center and just other groups using AI has certainly helped on the journey, pun intended.

00:15:54:37 - 00:16:26:18
不明
Thank you. Thanks, Marie. Well, I'll, I'll use an expression I learned during this this session. I will echo that like. Know. Yeah. Like I mentioned before, in this session, it's really the, the management buying and the fact that like for innovation also for AI, we installed a board that helps to promote, to align and to get everybody on board of the of the whole AI train.

00:16:26:23 - 00:16:58:39
不明
To get there, I feel like I need a ton. It'll come there. Yeah. Thank you. I think it's a good AI. You're going to get great returns from. It's terrible. Oh, we're here all the night. Keep your waiters. So I think across all the three brands, you've gone through, the various, journey in terms of navigating the AI solutions for your, industry.

00:16:58:44 - 00:17:21:56
不明
So now I think in the audience, we have, leaders from different industries and, managing various brands. They may be in the different stage of the journey in terms of, either they are already in the journey or planning for it. Is there any advice in terms of how they should approach in terms of navigating the journey based on your experience?

00:17:22:01 - 00:17:26:46
不明
What are the top three things they should look at?

00:17:26:50 - 00:17:44:22
不明
Just open question. Yeah, I don't I don't know. I mean the first thing is get started. If you're not doing it now, somebody else in your organization and they're going to be the people that are going to get the opportunities and the promotions and whatever else. If your company's not doing, one of your competitors is.

00:17:44:27 - 00:18:04:03
不明
So just keep that in mind. I think, a colleague of mine said this the other day, he, he, I guess, has an hour long commute. So he chats with copilot on his way in and out of work. He gives it ideas. It gives them ideas back. Right? Use it as a as an advisor. I think learning about the limitations and the capabilities is really important.

00:18:04:08 - 00:18:37:52
不明
Because you can start to see the patterns, right? Especially with lens, they, they sort of become a little predictable in the way they answer questions. But so start using it. Invest in upskilling or learning for your teams. Right. We have we use degreed which is a learning management platform. But we have leader tracks, we have employee tracks, you know, and then we're encouraging a ton of people to, to use tools outside of work that we currently don't support in the office, but just to generate ideas and input right into the conversation.

00:18:37:57 - 00:18:58:12
不明
We I said our CEO and our CIO are super invested in this as a future differentiator for us. I think two years ago we had 30 I use cases in the company. And at, the event I was at last week, we have over 700, right? The ideas are pouring in faster than we can even sift through them to figure out how to get them started or implemented.

00:18:58:12 - 00:19:26:58
不明
So I think we're now in a situation where there's not a shortage of how to use AI. It's now how do we do it at scale even more effectively? I would say to really sit down and think through again where it's appropriate. One thing that we did with Adobe recently, I'm sure everyone's tired of hearing the term content supply chain, but we started looking at that across the organization of where are the places that maybe we're not struggling and we don't need to to think differently.

00:19:27:03 - 00:19:47:04
不明
And where are the places where we we really are struggling and could think about tools differently and just think about different ways to use AI to either supplement some of the work the teams are doing to better personalize on the sites, to to do more at scale. So sitting down and mapping that out helped. I think with things like AI, it's very buzzy.

00:19:47:04 - 00:20:06:51
不明
It's like, oh, we got to do all the things. We've got to start with content. We've got to use the agents. We've got to, I don't know, do images and things like that. But but really figuring out where you can start so you can activate a little faster and not get hung up. I think on some of the things that could trip you up as you go further down the journey.

00:20:06:56 - 00:20:31:54
不明
Thank you. Yeah, I think it's, it's the, the story of just start to learn, adapt and grow along the way. I think that's the most important, the most important message. Thank you. I think, with that, I just want to, open the floor for, any questions from the audience, because we heard all the insightful discussion from the guest speakers.

00:20:31:58 - 00:20:46:05
不明
Just want to see. Is there any question from the audience before I get on to the next one? So we've been asked to have you go to the mic so that everybody can hear you and they can be heard on the recorded session.

00:20:46:10 - 00:21:23:46
不明
Hey everyone, thanks for the insights. The question that I have is, in the earlier keynote also that we had earlier today, it seems like AI is helping to optimize a lot of processes, but it's also kind of gravitating towards personalization and super personalization in your industries, especially that are open to end users. How do you kind of balance super personalization with still keeping your landscape open for people to realize that there are other options, too, that they can explore and not just give them a tunnel vision.

00:21:23:51 - 00:21:49:10
不明
Yeah, that's a great question. I would say we're still thinking about that as we think through just the capabilities. Now to your point, there's so many options. How do you even choose what to say when when there are so many different things? So I think looking across the channels, seeing what that customer behavior is like, using upsell as an opportunity, I think for us, that's what helps us to not limit it to just one hotel or one type of vacation.

00:21:49:24 - 00:22:08:24
不明
Where are the areas where we can sneak in and say, oh, we know you've traveled here before, or what about this? We've got an all inclusive there now. So keeping it open in that regard, but not necessarily, I would say like hitting somebody with the same message over and over. And I think that's where the passing comes in handy to really think through.

00:22:08:31 - 00:22:28:55
不明
Where are the the steps in the customer's journey that I can talk to them, that I should talk to them. What could this look like for someone that's interacting with us the first time versus the 500th? So I it's a process. I would say, but starting to think through it. And in that regard, for sure.

00:22:29:00 - 00:22:53:15
不明
You know, I think one thing we're doing is, you hear a lot about life stage being important for investors, right? So our personalization is very different for a 23 year old that just got at a college than a 35 to 45 year old that's got two kids and is thinking about college and struggling to figure out if they should put more money into five, 20 nines or retirement.

00:22:53:15 - 00:23:14:52
不明
Right. So, life stage helps us differentiate our personalization. It also helps us differentiate the types of not only messages we give, right, but also the products that we recommend for, for people, you know, the complexity of what you're dealing with as you enter your, you know, your late career retirement, how do you withdraw the right amount?

00:23:14:52 - 00:23:44:52
不明
How do you not run out of money? Right. There's very different things that are on the minds of investors over the course of their lives. And so we try to use those sort of life stage events as one thing to bounce of the things that we think are important for them to pay attention to. Right. And even then, you know, a 23 year old who's working as a software engineer that makes $150,000 needs completely different recommendations and advice than the same 23 year old who's working at a diner and making $45,000.

00:23:44:52 - 00:24:11:44
不明
Right. So part of that is just, you know, one of the biggest things you can do to be successful in investing is start, right. The other thing you can do is don't deviate. This is terrible to say, and I probably shouldn't say it on a recorded thing, but do you know who the most successful investors we have are people who are deceased because they don't change their strategy, because they don't react to the market fluctuations?

00:24:11:49 - 00:24:31:35
不明
But it's true. We have all this data that says if you stay the course over the long run, you will do well, right? Most people don't know. Warren Buffett made almost all of his real money after he turned 65, right, because of the power of time. So part of it is, you know, we have different messages for different audiences, but even those within you can't just generalize.

00:24:31:35 - 00:24:53:11
不明
23 year olds need this kind of personalization. It depends on where they live, what income they have. Do they or don't they have children yet, right? All of those things make make a difference. Yeah, it's a bit the same at the at the bounce. It really is. Do you have to see the customer as an individual 23 year old can go can be still in school, can already go to work.

00:24:53:11 - 00:25:08:25
不明
So it's a really complex combination of all different the different aspects. You know. Yeah. Any other questions. Yeah I think yeah. It's like.

00:25:08:30 - 00:25:44:46
不明
Okay okay. So who I so I work for an engineering firm and it's a little bit more B2B obviously. But I'm curious, what's the closest intersection you guys have had with AI and like, very technical or very regulated content? And have you kept that specifically divided? Have you been able to bucket areas where, hey, this needs to be professionally stamped, so to speak, and then within the lines we can put content.

00:25:44:49 - 00:26:10:52
不明
Have any of you guys had an experience similar to that, or have you? I guess approached those lines at any point in your journey. I mean, every piece of content we produce, regardless of if it's for B2B or B2C, has got to be approved by somebody, you know, a vanguard for compliance reasons. So, I mean, we're regulated by Finra and the SEC and there are very specific guidelines.

00:26:10:57 - 00:26:30:32

I think this is an area where LMS are going to be tremendously valuable, right. If they can essentially read the guidelines that come out from those agencies and they could do it globally, we have much more scale in the way that we can enforce compliance. Right. So, you know, we have two equally large B2B parts of our company.

00:26:30:32 - 00:26:55:44
不明
We we deal with advisors who we want them to tell their clients to put Vanguard products into their investments. We also work with institutional companies who provide for one KS or 503 BS or, you know, whatever defined contribution plan for their employees. And so the insights we get out of individual investor behavior, whether they're a retiree, a retirement participant or an individual, 529 still apply across the board, right?

00:26:55:44 - 00:27:16:48
不明
But the the sort of messaging that we go to in terms of those B2B businesses is quite different in how we try to get people to sort of listen to us. I mean, at the heart of it, it's all the same, right? We are here for the value of the investor. But, you know, until 15, 20 years ago, advisors didn't want to deal with us because we don't pay commissions to them.

00:27:16:53 - 00:27:39:18
不明
Right. So there's been change in the world where index funds are much more palatable for most types of portfolios, right? Low fees. Everybody's heard that now for a long time, especially since 2007 and eight. Right? So, you know, the messaging at the core of what the company does is very similar. But the specifics of where we go to market in our B2B spaces, where our versus our B to B to C are very different.

00:27:39:32 - 00:28:02:02
不明
But all of that is is regulated content. Thank you. One of the things that we're trying with the Journey Optimizer is to think through the concept of a content library where we can piecemeal things together on, I'll call it on the fly as we're doing it, and have those things pre-approved by, by legal or whoever the team is, so that it's not a process.

00:28:02:02 - 00:28:23:53
不明
Every single time, you know, when the team wants to kick off a journey, they don't have to wait ten days for a lawyer to to look at something. So how much can we put together that still makes sense that a lawyer would feel comfortable with doing so. That's been helpful. Well, we haven't, you know, launched anything yet, but in theory that will be very helpful for us that we've already got those pre-approved two pieces.

00:28:23:58 - 00:28:46:12
不明
Yeah. Same approach here. Just defining the the playing ground. And then it gives you a lot of liberty to, to do the things you think are the best for our, for our customers. And you go beyond that, that line and okay, you check with the, with legal. It gives a lot of, free space. Thank you. I think whether it's a B2B or B2C.

00:28:46:17 - 00:29:12:00
不明
Yeah, there's a question. Yeah, yeah. Please go now. I think my question is about, the roadmap. You have a vision for your product and then you have a roadmap. But the breakneck speed, the technology innovations are happening last year. You know, your content supply chain meant you have am you have blog front five levels coming into picture.

00:29:12:00 - 00:29:47:04
不明
Then you have compliant system. You integrate them. You are good to go. Now there are five more alphabets in that soup for So how do you build a roadmap and is all about the, the new, you have, Firefly full speed right now. You have Journey Studio, then you have agent in, the agent approach that, launched by Adobe is all driving personalization and content, all journey and AI driven.

00:29:47:09 - 00:30:11:02
不明
So how any challenge, any solution that you are? Yeah, I think so. If you look at the the way we have organized in making the AI real for the brands, right, instead of looking at these are the tools or these are the capabilities available of industry, look at what is the business problem we are trying to address or solve.

00:30:11:16 - 00:30:38:31
不明
Right. Then orchestrate based on the value versus feasibility. Because there are certain capabilities and tools may work in your industry, your company and your ecosystem of the legal and compliance and security that may not work for other industry. So finally, the business use case then orchestrate based on the purpose not to look at so many tools and technologies available.

00:30:38:31 - 00:31:03:15
不明
I know to leverage all of them. And what should I do? It? So I think because, as you rightly said, the kind of, the innovation happening in the technology every day is something new coming up from a the leverage and adoption perspective. Look at the purpose, the problem to be solved. That's the only way we can, stay with the journey.

00:31:03:19 - 00:31:25:23
不明
So I needed because I was at a financial services industry lunch today, and one of the stats that they shared was about, sort of any of, you know, the martech adoption or your roadmap and, like, the impact of the tools, everybody thought that would be really high. The reality is the impact across the implementation was considerably lower when they did a post implementation survey.

00:31:25:28 - 00:31:43:37
不明
And the two areas that were really high where people and process. And I think you hear this at these events, whether it's Salesforce or Adobe or whoever, right? That if you buy a stack of tools, you're going to do magic. But if you don't bring your people in your process along with it, you're not going to do very good magic right now.

00:31:43:37 - 00:32:06:52
不明
The reality of I think your question is great. And so I'm it works with me and Vanguard. I think flexibility in your process is the key, right. Well, I think you're if you you need to continue to have a multi-year North star right around what you're trying to deliver, what business problem you're trying to solve. But your approach and your flexibility around how you're going to solve that has to change much more frequently now.

00:32:06:57 - 00:32:33:00
不明
Like just, you know, our CEO, our team is inundated by the changes that are happening within Google's, you know, generative answer engine work. If you guys haven't read some of the Gartner stuff on this, we're terrified people aren't going to come to our site anymore, right, because they can get an answer that is robust enough in a ChatGPT or a Google or of Bing type in an interface that they don't need to come read it on our site anymore.

00:32:33:00 - 00:33:07:12
不明
Right. So how do you draw out of that experience to get people to come see long form content, videos or short form content videos or, you know, audio or whatever it is, right? But you have to get them to engage differently than simply getting a generated answer off of the content that's already available on your website. So anyway, back to flexibility, I think is, you know, I guarantee our search teams probably changed direction 3 or 4 times, always with the same North star of attracting more and more prospects to come to Vanguard through effective search, you know, advertising.

00:33:07:12 - 00:33:29:23
不明
But you can no longer set a three year course and start out slowly. Right. You got to look at that every quarter or every, you know, maybe every and every couple of sprints. So flexibility in the process I think is a key. Thank you. Thanks, Ron. So I would like to, summarize the overall, panel discussion. In making the AI real for brands.

00:33:29:24 - 00:33:57:18
不明
We looked at the four different sections of the steps. First is about look at the business problem and identify the business use case which are trying to solve. That's the first thing. Second is about orchestrating the AI and deliver up the, you know, solutions available, the tools available specific to that purpose. Third is about how do you balance the humanity high the harmony.

00:33:57:23 - 00:34:25:50
不明
That's a third part of it. Well, one, two and three is getting ready. You need to look at the fourth in parallel, navigating internally that looking at your data readiness, your legal and security compliance and your talent, employee readiness to use the tool and the capability. Right. Navigating the journey. So these are the four important steps when you're trying to make a real for your brand.

00:34:25:55 - 00:34:45:01
不明
I think it was a very insightful discussion and valuable, input from all the industry leaders here across the travel industry, hospitality and the financial services, investment management. So I thank you very much. Thanks for the questions. This.
