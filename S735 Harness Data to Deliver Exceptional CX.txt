00:00:00:00 - 00:00:18:04
不明
Right. Welcome, everyone. Thank you. I know we're kind of coming towards the end of our journey, so I appreciate everyone being here. I will say we want this to be of an active session. And what I mean by that is we've got some questions here and I'll be doing some introductions in a moment. But towards, you know, halfway through we'll ask you if you have questions.

00:00:18:04 - 00:00:38:07
不明
So feel free. It's kind of a, a close group here. I'd like to say we're all friends, but I don't know everyone yet. But we will be by the end of this. How about that? So I am Courtney Keating, chief marketing officer of axiom. Today we're going to be talking about how we really take a look at harnessing data technology and platforms to have the best customer experience.

00:00:38:09 - 00:01:09:22
不明
Joining me today, I have two great leaders, two different journeys in terms of unlocking value. Just so all right. Thank you for joining me. Vice president Head of marketing, data analytics and privacy platforms for Prudential Financial. Welcome. Bob Gucci, managing director, U.S. personal Bank. Head of marketing, transformation and delivery at Citi. So welcome, welcome. As we take a look at the journey that we're on, why we're here.

00:01:09:24 - 00:01:37:14
不明
I think what's interesting is to reflect on what is it we're trying to accomplish in this era of data complexity and transformation and technology and platforms. How do we decide what really matters in terms of unlocking value? Just so, I'll start with you. So I will, first of all, thank you for having us here. And, thank you to Adobe as well.

00:01:37:14 - 00:02:10:28
不明
But so when I'd start, as with our, you know, where this journey began for Prudential, right? So it was a massive transformation sort of that we took on about three years ago. And the three things that mattered to us the most when we started off this, this journey was the first thing was getting the mindset of the people in the marketing organization right, the mindset to put the customer in the middle and start thinking about sort of how best you can leverage that to drive like personalization.

00:02:10:28 - 00:02:35:20
不明
So that was part of kind of the overall journey that we started with. And then it came down to sort of the, from looking not not here, but it came down to, this, your process is a lot. What, what we talked to the people, the process and sort of the platforms and that kind of sink together or with, with a strategy in place.

00:02:35:20 - 00:03:10:03
不明
So the second piece that was critical in this transformation was the strategy piece. Right. So you want to keep it, simple enough so that it is achievable measurable. And you can sort of leverage that to break down and come up with sort of the right level of use cases, for, for your organization. And so those were kind of the key pieces for us, that kind of, helped us drive this, drive us to this point, I would say even I'm, you know, a multi-year journey.

00:03:10:03 - 00:03:37:03
不明
So I hear people, processes, mindset and creating simplicity so you can share that vision. But what do you think? Where are you in terms of your start? And what do you think matters when you look at the whole landscape? We're in a different place and it's a good place again, context. Some of the teams here, we we run all the activation, all the channels, the data ecosystem, the martech ecosystem planning for, for the consumer bank, marketing teams.

00:03:37:11 - 00:03:58:21
不明
It's a big universe. I came back to city two years ago, probably all bright eyed and bushy tailed. We're going to work on some cool tools. We're going to do some neat data stuff. And then I got a wake up call real fast, that, you know, maybe, maybe transformation wasn't going to start on day one. And the reality was like, listen, things are breaking every day.

00:03:58:21 - 00:04:22:01
不明
We're pumping out tens of billions of communications to consumers. If one of those goes wrong, I have to report that to the board, depending on the tier violation that their rig, the rig violation. And so really that that first six, maybe it was 12 months was just stopping the bleeding. Like how do we get this ecosystem in control?

00:04:22:03 - 00:04:49:04
不明
We had incredible logos that we had implemented, including, a multitude of Adobe products and other logos that I won't mention here. For, for obvious reasons, great applications, very disparate ecosystem. And that just led to a hugely fragmented process ecosystem. Again, the team, some of the team here is live through that. And I was just like, just let's get that stabilized and then let's set six, 12 months in.

00:04:49:04 - 00:05:20:24
不明
We'll set a really clear journey for how we're going to lay a foundation for change. And and we're further along now. But it really was about two things. It's like 5 to 10 domains. We could tackle channels offers, you name it, two things. If we don't get right our data foundation, our content foundation. And we talked about it yesterday, we have four four cms sitting out there that's just not going to work.

00:05:20:26 - 00:05:42:05
不明
We're never going to succeed. I can't create sustainable operations, efficient operations if I'm dealing with that kind of ecosystem. And so their journey now is we've got it stabilized. And what matters for change is having a clear view on those two foundational pieces for us can be different for other people. That's where we're at. And I think we're accelerating pretty quickly.

00:05:42:07 - 00:06:07:05
不明
You guys are further ahead, and I'm. Just because we're at the tail end, I mean, tail end can be. But I think like from a foundations perspective, I think we're almost there. And that sort of helps sort of, kind of find our way forward. What does success look like to sell in 2 to 3 years? Like you've got the customer at the center of this.

00:06:07:05 - 00:06:34:29
不明
What does success look like? I mean, success, for at least as would look like if we were able to kind of get this right. I mean, there's a couple of things that we've always wanted. So one is get this tool in the hands of our marketers. So self-serve would be a big achievement if we can get through that, get our marketers just sort of use the tool to analyze populations, segment right, build segments, and sort of activate on their own.

00:06:34:29 - 00:06:56:28
不明
If, if, if the company allows. And so that is kind of the key sort of, driver for us. Yeah. Yeah. Sounds great. And, what do you think? What's success look like? I know you start in the journey, but you got to think with success in mind on on a personal level, two years ago, I'm like, oh, we didn't have any gray hair in that picture.

00:06:57:27 - 00:07:22:28
不明
So this isn't going well. You and me both, right? Yeah. No. You look great. But but seriously, you're like. So again, we we run a very big operational team, and again, a sizable technology team, and and success is, like I mentioned before, I got four of everything. You name the logo, I got it right. We.

00:07:23:00 - 00:07:46:11
不明
Not it. Not a good thing, obviously. Success in the next 1 to 2 years. I think we know what we want to be in. Full disclosure, we have an RFP out there on on CDP, so I can't talk about that. But but we have an idea. The directions we want to go in, make those decisions, and start scaling very, very fast.

00:07:46:13 - 00:08:06:17
不明
That success. I need to know definitively what that's going to be by the end of the year. I think we're pretty close to that in some cases, be it channels or content. We know what that is. CMS is, we know what that is. So it's a matter of accelerating the path forward. And we have some good programs led by the team here then.

00:08:06:17 - 00:08:34:17
不明
Right. Like I the way we built things was very channel specific. It was we took a bunch of applications and we made them do what city does, which isn't again, we're we're sending billions of communications, which is a I mean, and we're operating at four plus sigma. So it's not terrible, but it's not scalable, honestly. And so I got to get that collapse because then I know what I'm hiring for.

00:08:34:20 - 00:08:54:09
不明
And right, I can't hire for four different skillsets. Then I can know what my location strategy is going to be, and I can start building an organization, Centers of excellence. And I can partner with folks like Axiom and Adobe or whatever the case may be, in a more meaningful, strategic way. Today, all of our investments are spread over 500 things.

00:08:54:11 - 00:09:22:00
不明
That's not, way to succeed. So that's something we're aggressively trying to fix, recalibrate and make again our processes and our capabilities very application centric as opposed to the legacy legacy way we've always done things. You're both unifying teams to bring this vision to life. There's challenges along the way. And one thing just so you and I talked about this week is for people that are across the organization.

00:09:22:03 - 00:09:39:05
不明
How do you make this real to them, and what's the importance is maybe a little more tactical. And what's the importance of of having a business case so that people can understand to start this off. Right. So I mean, I don't know how many of you all are familiar with, some of the Adobe products, but everything works off of a business case.

00:09:39:05 - 00:10:06:15
不明
Right? So I think the first question when you get into sort of implementing the solutions is like, what's the business case? And that's where your strategy comes in. And the clarity in terms of how you sort of break down what you want to achieve. Again, for us it could be different across each businesses, but the use case is the most important team that I mean, thing that will sort of help you drive value off of your platform.

00:10:06:15 - 00:10:21:20
不明
So I mean that's that's with that. I mean that's a no brainer, right? And that's important because, you know, like I said, you're unifying teams. You bring together. You need the advocates. What's it like from a leadership perspective. And and how do you lead the change with those advocates. And I'm going to talk to you a little bit about that.

00:10:21:20 - 00:10:45:15
不明
Sure. Change management. What what the heck is that? It seems like I like there's 15 books up about it, but what does it look like practically on the ground? To me, it's a sign. I'm a process guy. I'm an industrial engineer. That's my background. That's what I came from. I've always run transformation teams for years, and it's a science.

00:10:45:15 - 00:11:11:22
不明
It's a discipline. And there's. Yeah, there's art to it. But again, I'm not going to give you your name because you can't steal her because she's incredible. We'll call her Jane. That's not her name. We've, there there are two sides of this affecting the transformation, right? It's about your stack, the application stack. And having a great martech leader, which we do.

00:11:11:25 - 00:11:37:08
不明
We'll call him Jim. Because you can't you can't steal him either. Someone who's been there and done it before multiple times. You got to have that. And and then the other side of that is, is the business architecture. And having a very thoughtful, proactive, disciplined way of how to affect change because everything crosses like 30 different functions in our organization.

00:11:37:11 - 00:12:15:18
不明
And the way we've done that is, again, we have a small group of folks, a transformation team that helps drive in, really choreograph all the facilitation in a very agile way, basically. I mean, we're literally getting in the room week in, week out on specific topics with cross-functional teams, marketers, the analytics teams, operations technology. And we are I mean, there's probably 10,000 sticky notes on the wall to map out process and organizational design from what we think we're going to get from the applications that we're going to implement.

00:12:15:21 - 00:12:39:00
不明
Historically, we haven't done we hadn't done a good job, great integration, maybe a little less thoughtful about how to bring the teams along and be ready on day one. And then I can't scale. We implemented an orchestration engine. I won't name the name. It's not an Adobe tool. It's not fully scaled. Sorry, Steve. Right.

00:12:39:07 - 00:13:02:07
不明
But it we literally just implemented it. Another team did. And, like, what am I going to do with this? I don't have anybody knows how to use it. I haven't integrated into my operations. That's not a recipe for success. The time we started thinking about the tooling, we should have started thinking about the people, the operating model, the associated process.

00:13:02:10 - 00:13:23:00
不明
And you got to do that with the teams in a room together, battling it out and having the hard, discussions. So make sense. And bringing people together. Just all you're great at doing that. When we talked I was inspired. You talk about mindset. It's important. You also talked about some surprise areas of of opportunity and advocates around marketing and sales.

00:13:23:04 - 00:13:41:12
不明
Do you want to talk a little bit more about that? What you're seeing. Yeah. So some of the use cases that kind of we drove off the platform I one is quite unique. And I I'd like to talk a little bit about that use case. So where we went out and integrated our sales and marketing organizations. Right.

00:13:41:12 - 00:14:08:03
不明
So we basically using data that is generated on both platforms, kind of marrying the two to help our advisors sort of, either religion or proper sort of, and like, flags is what we flag them. What, what kind of information the customer was looking for. So when they get this information, there's sort of, you know, highly personalized statements that can be offered to the end client that they're talking to.

00:14:08:17 - 00:14:33:01
不明
That's, I think, very unique way that we, we use the platform as opposed I mean, I don't know if you've if you've heard a lot of kind of, at the different sessions here, but they talk about most of it is a retail application where mostly in the B2B space and this sort of, use case that has, I think, gone to market is quite powerful for our sales organization.

00:14:33:03 - 00:15:00:16
不明
I know one thing I know about sales and marketing, we tend to be pretty, you know, verbal vocal about these things. So there's some advocates built in right there. Let's talk a little bit more about impactful ways of upskilling the different groups. You know, we talked about, you know, getting in a room getting it done. But when you think about augmentation of workforce and upskilling just different individuals education, learning what you approach, ties into what I was saying before.

00:15:00:18 - 00:15:24:15
不明
We have to be very thoughtful about the people model that's going to ensue post application integration. A few factors there, right? Because it's like depending on the application, some of that talent is really hard to find. It can be really expensive. And it takes time. I and we've been I won't, I won't, say this necessarily with great pride.

00:15:24:17 - 00:15:48:10
不明
I it's a good kind of party favor here. I'm one of the largest customers in the United States Postal Service. I won't tell you what number, but it's single digit. The point being is we have a lot of legacy ways of working. And our intent is to try to bring the legacy team along with us to adopt the new applications.

00:15:48:28 - 00:16:10:00
不明
But that it can't just be one way. And so a big part of that is and even with Acxiom, also with Adobe, like, again, just like any big operations shop, which again, we are staff augmentation is a huge factor. And so we're constantly out in the workforce partnering with folks like Acxiom, Adobe and others to acquire talent.

00:16:10:00 - 00:16:33:07
不明
Folks have seen it and done it and no to the art of the possible to integrate them as part of AI staff. Right? Literally a third of our team is staff OG from some of these partners that are experts have done it again. We have our, legacy staff that we blend these two together to kind of bring you know, uplift the whole team into a new application and process ecosystem.

00:16:33:09 - 00:16:56:08
不明
That's been a big part of our strategy. And again, as we, you know, same thing with the use cases. We're going to experiment, test and learn use case by use case. And that momentum will generate momentum be it in orchestration. As we get into CDP, as we're doing omnichannel CMS with a that's been our strategy. And again, I think we're getting a foothold.

00:16:56:11 - 00:17:14:19
不明
Yeah, it's a great, great ways of looking at this. And, you know, just a we talked about this as well, which is how are you helping with the adoption of data and technology with your teams. So we're taking a little bit of a different approach in terms of how we're driving adoption, obviously. I mean, we've been through the process.

00:17:14:19 - 00:17:36:20
不明
I think we're the organization gets some of, the capabilities that that we've kind of installed. But like, I do have to go back all the way to kind of our stack. Right. So but we went through a massive, you know, process of rationalizing our entire martech side. We had a buffet of platforms similar to kind of what, what you guys are going through right now.

00:17:36:20 - 00:18:18:26
不明
But then we brought it down to a manageable sort of, ecosystem. And then the first it started with obviously changing the mindset and then got into heavily into change management and training and stuff like that. As we were going through our implementation phase, I would say, and we're still going through that. It's constant education that, you know, we're doing on a day in, day out basis with our partners across, you know, the various businesses and were obviously driving towards self-serve, which is where we're trying to upskill them and trying to build interfaces that are easy to use.

00:18:18:26 - 00:18:37:21
不明
No code, low code, whatever you call it. But at least our practitioners are marketers should be able to sort of, handle at least basic stuff on the platform is where we're headed. Make it easy to use. Yeah, right. And take away a little bit of the intimidation factor. We're constantly learning new tools, new techniques, new technology, how to apply it.

00:18:37:27 - 00:19:10:22
不明
It's daunting. It's continuous learning and it sounds like you both have great ways of whether it's augmenting with different workforces or just the constant education of bringing people along with you. So I keep going. So on the workforce side, I think we took a little bit of a different approach as well. So we pretty much have sort of, given that we were going down the agile path of delivery, we created sort of small paths within within the organization wherein, you know, like basically partners on different parts of the organization from sort of small parts.

00:19:10:24 - 00:19:29:06
不明
And that's where I mean, through that sort of bar. We've got technology at the table, we've got business at the table, we've got martech on the table. And then that's how we're sort of, driving a lot of our work incrementally. Through through the course of the agile process. That's I think that's a best practice. Right there as well.

00:19:29:08 - 00:19:58:11
不明
You mentioned you both mentioned partners. What's important when selecting a partner? What do you look at? It's probably a long list to, to make it short. Are you gonna give me a good deal? I heard the RFP thing, and these may be related. Yeah, yeah. Know, it's got to be a good deal commercially. And in terms of, just to be frank about things and, you know, we city drive a hard bargain.

00:19:59:13 - 00:20:24:00
不明
There are limited dollars. The more I can, spread those dollars to a multitude of capabilities and services, the better. So looking for that good deal. It's also sustainable and and economically viable. So I think that's number one. Two, honestly, is is trust. Can I work with these guys? Is this somebody I want to be in business with and they're going to be a straight shooter?

00:20:24:13 - 00:20:48:29
不明
I think, you know, we work very closely with with axiom and Adobe, and I think we have that. Otherwise we wouldn't even I don't care what how good the application is if it's going to be, a tough relationship, it's I don't want to walk in the building and deal with that. Honestly, life's too short. And so I think especially with Acxiom and Adobe and some others, we're in a good place.

00:20:49:15 - 00:21:17:08
不明
Then again, I think we can have candid conversations about capabilities. And it's not all about selling something or extracting. Try to extract dollars from somebody. And. Yeah, absolutely. The the functionality fit for purpose. It's got to be there. Last they got to know something about us and that that context, and because that context, knowing something about us, whether however muddy or perfect it may be and we're pretty muddy.

00:21:19:27 - 00:21:40:17
不明
Am I being recorded? I like to say city. We make. City we make hard harder sometimes. But that's any big enterprise. But but can that partner, can they understand where we're coming from, the challenges we're dealing with, both technically and operationally, and provide me with an honest perspective of how to think differently?

00:21:40:29 - 00:21:59:27
不明
Because sometimes we just don't have that internally, especially if we're moving to a neutral set. You know, like adopting a new CDP. Like, again, we have some great experts in the building. But again, it's a big it's a big endeavor, and we need a lot of support to make that happen effectively. So that would be the other dimension.

00:22:00:00 - 00:22:21:23
不明
It's trust. I noticed that it is also, you know, the value realization and meeting people where they are. You both are in different journeys in different places and industries, highly regulated, but still insurance, banking. What about you? Just what are you looking for in a partner? I mean, so I'm going to take a little bit of a different approach here again.

00:22:22:20 - 00:22:46:23
不明
Oh I look at the problem first. Right. And then, you know, in the sort of, the ecosystem or the supply chain, sort of, and then once we identify the gap or the opportunity, whatever you want to call it, but that's when we start looking for the right fit. I mean, in addition to the cultural fit, I think there's internal and external partners that we focus on.

00:22:46:23 - 00:23:16:22
不明
So obviously internally, I think it's, our, you know, partner organizations within technologies, within the business. I mean, that's kind of critical, the partnerships for us to maintain. But in addition to that, when we look for things outside, it's again, it's solving for the problem rather than sort of because most of our teams are in-house. So, when we hit a specific problem, that's, that's when we sort of, bring someone in to fix that particular piece.

00:23:16:25 - 00:23:33:11
不明
I'm going to ask a follow up because it's very related to this. You know, we here, how do you pick tools? How are you playing? I what I'm hearing from you is you got to figure out what the challenge, the opportunity is, not just try to figure out how cool the tool is. It's exactly. Is that pretty accurate?

00:23:33:12 - 00:23:52:23
不明
Because, I mean, I think we kind of landed in that process. And this is early stage when we sort of started our journey. Right. We went from this buffet of platforms down to sort of, you know, manageable set. And that's where our learnings came from in terms of not, you know, pre BI sort of tools.

00:23:52:25 - 00:24:21:27
不明
We anticipate use it, we anticipate the problem, the challenge and then sort of get into the tool. Very pragmatic. Anything to add I mean it's just can't get it wrong. Yeah. There's just not enough time. And, and if I'm going to spend a year plus implementing a new tool and it's the wrong tool, big trouble and we adopt again the decisions that were made before my time.

00:24:21:29 - 00:24:43:18
不明
Again, there were educated decisions. Folks thought they were doing the right thing in many cases they did. But there is also some collateral damage, like in the wrong tool. It doesn't orchestrate, it doesn't play well with other logos, and maybe we didn't have, a buttoned up plan to think about that three year point of arrival. I think we do now.

00:24:43:20 - 00:25:03:12
不明
I know we do now. And we're on the path, but, it, you know, there's there's just not enough time. And these roles don't last forever. And you want to make an impact. So, yeah, you're going to take a risk. You're going to take a shot at it. But again, we're trying to be very, very mindful about the plan upfront.

00:25:03:26 - 00:25:26:21
不明
So when we sign that contract, we feel good about it. It's purposeful. Yeah, absolutely. We talked also about this journey around connecting, you know, how you're leveraging data technology. But to really connect to content. Tell us a little bit about your content journey. I know that you were looking at, you know, how does this all fit together to connect it?

00:25:26:23 - 00:25:52:10
不明
I don't know, we're figuring out. There we go. Hey, that's why we're here, right? But but, you know, if we explore that challenge and unpack it a little bit, is that the content component is the overall I mean, hyper personalization at scale, right? Offer at the right time to the right person. But at the same time, how are you trying to look at that in terms of making the process different potentially, and or shortening the time to impact?

00:25:52:13 - 00:26:19:25

Well, not like using the content space as an example. Not only we have for whatever CMS is like, I don't know, we can we could probably find content in shoeboxes under somebody's desk. You know, that's that's that's the dam for us. It's everywhere. Again, just not not a path to success. So, I mean, just getting a rationalized taxonomy, trying to collapse that into a singular ecosystem.

00:26:19:27 - 00:26:46:08
不明
And again, using Am, which we are absolutely in love with, to really be the center, our omni channel, content tool, that's a huge leap for us. We're in the middle of that experimentation, beyond our com into email, again, hopefully, hopefully in the next couple months, we'll have some good proof points that it's going to work.

00:26:46:18 - 00:27:10:29
不明
Again, that's in partnership with Axiom and Adobe directly. A lot of hope will move on to our direct mail channel, which we still love. You works. Yeah. I get no benefits from being one of the largest mail USPS. You would think I will get a discount on stamps, I get nothing. So. So, I don't know if that answers the question, but, like, that's a little bit of the path.

00:27:11:22 - 00:27:40:21
不明
Again, the last thing I'll say is, email campaign, you know, our our we have trigger campaigns. We do a lot of those, you know, healthy double digit percent of our volumes through real time triggers and journeys. But a lot about bespoke campaigns. That's just what we love to do. We like to, I don't know, our content reuse rates, reuse rate is an awesome story is not awesome.

00:27:41:23 - 00:28:22:29
不明
It will be. It will be, so, like, I can't take I won't say the number, but it's weeks to market for an email campaign. Our goal is we call it the drive to five. How do I get it out in five days or less for a net new campaign, even if you're changing assets. So using tools like a, template, sizing with marketers, using flexible tools to quickly change on the fly, we're starting to do and so hopefully I think we've gotten it down in some cases to ten, 15 days, from, well, like double digit weeks.

00:28:24:00 - 00:28:46:15
不明
Part of that is through tooling. A lot of it's just through simple discipline and process and partnership with the marketers that, hey, we can create custom, both audiences and content for you, and we can do it in speed. And that's a rally cry. Drive to five, right? It sounds like this is something that internally, people are really seeing trademarked and seeing the path.

00:28:46:15 - 00:29:05:19
不明
Right. Registered. Talk to me afterwards. I'll let you know how I do it. I'm just kidding. Anything like drive to five for you in terms of trying to shorten some of these timelines. I mean, yeah, it's it's coming down. The numbers are coming down for us. But yeah, we were, I think exactly in the same space. I guess it used to take us months to get something out.

00:29:05:19 - 00:29:27:28
不明
Right. We were dealing with Excel spreadsheets and sort of data and on people's computers and whatnot. So, the way we were able to sort of given given the journey, given the rationalization, it was simple enough to integrate the ecosystem. That made it a lot more easier for us to sort of, you know, get things out of the door once properly wired.

00:29:27:28 - 00:29:51:04
不明
Right. So it took us the last three years to get everything wired the right way in terms of, the ecosystem. But at this point, I think, we're getting a little better in terms of executing sort of, campaigns out of the door. The cycle times have come down significantly. And then, the level of personalization that we're doing is much higher.

00:29:51:04 - 00:30:12:04
不明
And the level of experimentation that we're pushing out is much higher. So this has all been enabled based on sort of the the architecture and the tool stack that we've put in place and sort of the right connectivity and the data flows are in place right now. So that kind of helps a lot. That's all foundational in nature, which is where we focused quite a bit of quite a bit to get that foundation right.

00:30:12:04 - 00:30:31:20
不明
And so now at least we're reaping some benefit. And I'm hoping to do a lot more and, probably through these platforms as, as we progress through, you know, there's a reason to believe. Bob, what do you think about that? What was the question? I'm sorry. In terms of what? You know, how you you're going to drive to five is some of the different processing tools that you're using.

00:30:32:22 - 00:30:51:07
不明
It takes a while, right? So, you know, what have you learned in terms of just the conversation? I know we've met a few times, and this has been the most enriching part of this meeting for me is the network that you make here and the people that you get to meet and what you've learned along. I guess what helps me to get to my drive to five, well, like this has been incredible.

00:30:51:16 - 00:31:13:17
不明
I'm I'm, an Adobe Summit rookie. I packed all the wrong things, and the panel sessions have been incredible. It's honestly what's been happening between the panels to learn about, like. All right, what's our next drive to five? How can we use a differently. What does CDP look like for you? How do we think about that?

00:31:13:24 - 00:31:37:05
不明
And so that that has been invaluable again, that those one on one personal meetings between sessions, not not to say that the panels haven't been great, but like, candidly, I, I'm coming here and we're coming here with very specific questions about very specific tools. Obviously, I can't disclose the world about what we're doing in a public forum.

00:31:37:23 - 00:32:07:03
不明
And neither can other folks. And but getting that personal connection one on one on the side has been invaluable. So we can attack those very specific questions on, again, omni channel integration for CMS. Again, you know, the, the fraught journey that CDP might be and what to do and not to do. So those have been key to help again formulate the next kind of big thing for us.

00:32:07:09 - 00:32:23:11
不明
And this to moderate, you know, for time you've joined this event. Now what do you see. And in terms of similar camaraderie, where do you get most of your insights this event. Well it's been yeah. It's been four years or three years, whatever. But every year has been different. I, I'd say I think the first year was all about learning.

00:32:23:12 - 00:32:50:15
不明
I think that was the, the excitement. Right coming here. Going to the sessions. And then the second year was more about networking and sort of getting to know who's who in the space and understanding what new companies are coming. But this year has been a little different. I think I spent a lot of my time with the Adobe product people because, again, I think I mentioned this, but we're, brought up pretty heavy Adobe shop.

00:32:50:15 - 00:33:17:16
不明
So that time with those engineers sort of unpacks a lot of like, I mean, you know, every platform has some issues or nuances that we need to get fixed, this time around, that spending that time with these different sort of engineers on the Adobe side has been quite helpful. Putting a name like putting a face to the name, I feel like things will move much faster as, as, you know, we get out of here and start continue to work with these guys.

00:33:17:18 - 00:33:35:13
不明
All right. Well worth it. I'm going to pause here and say, do we have any questions from the audience? We've got a couple folks, Eileen and Christine with mics, so don't be shy. Any questions for us up here. Thank you all for being here. I'd be remiss if I didn't show the axiom QR code, so take a photo if you'd like to learn more about us.

00:33:35:13 - 00:33:55:17
不明
Right. And then also, I also want to say you can win something today. What means something to me? We're all about KPIs, right? Please go into the survey and tell us what you thought about this session. What can we do more of, less of? But I appreciate you all being here today. And let's hear it for our panel.

00:33:55:19 - 00:33:57:25
不明
All right. Thanks everyone. Thank you.
