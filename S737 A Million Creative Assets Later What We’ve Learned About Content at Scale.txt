00:00:00:00 - 00:00:26:26

Thank you all for coming. First of all, before we get started, I just want to introduce who we are. So my name is is Jonathan. I'm global SVP of technology of an agency called depth. And I'm joined by Joshua. Yes. Hello. I'm Joshua young. I'm with Adobe. I am, the head of the solution sales team in Amea that focuses on content and work front.

00:00:26:29 - 00:00:45:25
不明
I have to say, by the way, I was thinking when we were sitting, like, in a movie theater, everybody wants to sit in the middle. But here it seems to be like the complete opposite. Nobody's in the middle, just parted ways like you're in the middle, but everybody out there. So I'm excited to be here. I live in, Denmark, in Copenhagen, and I support the amea business with everything continent, work front, content supply chain.

00:00:45:25 - 00:01:02:18
不明
And I'm very excited to talk about assets here and very pleased that the team at depth invited me to join them today. So thank you. Thank you much for for joining. Some of you may have heard of that. Some of you might be less familiar with us. So I just want to very quickly introduces as a company as well.

00:01:02:24 - 00:01:43:13
不明
So depth is a global digital agency who has been built with a unique 5050 combination of technology and marketing, skills, with about 4000 people across Europe, Americas and apart. We unlock tomorrow's possibilities for today's most ambitious companies. And we're a platinum Adobe partner. And we've been working in the and the Adobe ecosystem for many, many years. Now, because of that 5050 split between tech and marketing, we've always been very focused on ways to improve marketing performance by using technology.

00:01:43:16 - 00:02:06:17
不明
And as the demand for creative assets over the past few years has grown because of personalization, because of the increase in different channels, whether that be CRM on sites, paid media. We've had to come up with a way to find a cost efficient method to creating lots and lots of content to feed all those users of content.

00:02:06:19 - 00:02:38:06
不明
So about five years ago, we decided to set up a dedicated team called the Creative Automation Team, and they were very focused on developing processes, some tools, ways of working about how we could really scale the content production process and solve the assets at scale. Challenge. And it worked pretty well. And in the past five years, we've created well over a million assets for brands such as Spotify.

00:02:38:06 - 00:03:29:27
不明
I just eat takeaway super smart and many, many more. And through all these experiences of creating these million assets, we've learned what works well, what doesn't work well, and really how to make the most impact in doing creative automation. And as I say, the good news is it really does work. And what I really want to do over the next 45 minutes is to share with you five lessons that we've learned over doing this, to make sure those of you who are just starting your journey in creative automation or looking to scale up, your creative automation, can do it without making some of the same mistakes that we have made.

00:03:30:00 - 00:03:54:01
不明
Okay. Before I get started with the lessons, I think it's really important that we just make sure we're on the same page about what creative automation is. Because when we do demos for kinds of creative automation, they go, oh, wow, that's magic. And wow, I would really like to go home to my children and say, I did magic on stage in Las Vegas.

00:03:54:03 - 00:04:16:03
不明
Unfortunately, it's it isn't magic. So I'm just going to peel back the curtain a little bit and, and explain what it is. And it's actually two very simple concepts sprinkled with some technology on top. The first concept is a template, whether it be a static templates are emotion templates and a template sets the layouts of the assets that we're creating.

00:04:16:05 - 00:04:41:27
不明
And in that template there are a number of placeholders placeholders for text, for images, for video. And we can also set a number of variables for things like different fonts, different colors, and anything else that we want to be able to vary within the creative asset. So that's the first part, the templates. The second part of the data feeds, and the data feeds are where we feed all the different content with different variations of content.

00:04:41:27 - 00:05:01:17
不明
So in this example we've got a different food image, a space for the place holder for copy one and space for place out of the copy too. And we can create as many different variations of different types of content to fill those placeholders as we want. As I say, there can be images that can be text, they can be video, whatever.

00:05:01:20 - 00:05:27:06
不明
And then the creative automation part is the technology, which basically takes all those different variables. It creates all the different combinations of all those different variables together. And then it passes it to the template and it renders every single variant. So every single row in that spreadsheet, it will create an individual asset with that unique combination of all those different pieces of text.

00:05:27:09 - 00:05:48:02
不明
And it scales really, really quickly. So if we just have three different columns with ten different variables, we've got a thousand assets at the end. So abracadabra, that's the magic. Yeah I like analogies as well. But I like rock star analogies. Right. So how many people here have dreamed of being a rock star at some point in their lives?

00:05:48:04 - 00:06:05:04
不明
Come on, be honest. Rock stars, right? I haven't given up on this dream. I still believe one day I'll be on the streets of Copenhagen when I'm old and retired, playing Bruce Springsteen songs with my American accent. And I, like, get a niche market in there. But we want you guys to be rock stars. And I think what's interesting.

00:06:05:06 - 00:06:22:02
不明
So I'm going to, by the way, sprinkle in a little bit of Adobe's perspective as we go through these five points that Jonathan is going to review. But high level, I want to talk about constant supply chain, because I think there's an interesting parallel between rock stars, because rock stars need to be an actual rock star, needs to be very creative.

00:06:22:05 - 00:06:38:26
不明
Obviously, they're creating something from nothing. They need to be collaborative. There's a whole team of people that support creating music and touring and all this stuff. Behind being a rock star. They need to be able to protect the assets that they create, because that music has a value to them, and that's what their business is built on, right.

00:06:38:26 - 00:06:55:20
不明
And they need to be able to get insights to know how to improve their story, and they need to be consistent. And my favorite rock star, I guess, would be maybe Bruce Springsteen, who's been consistent all of these years. And a big difference, though, with a rock star. In Bruce Springsteen's case, I'm a big fan of Born to Run.

00:06:55:20 - 00:07:15:16
不明
Did people like the song Born to Run? Yeah, it's best. Best as like my favorite song and I've probably heard it about 2000 times. Let's say only two of those times were live. The other times were the same recording that he created many years ago. So he doesn't have the ability to tweak and optimize and make it better outside of on tour.

00:07:15:18 - 00:07:36:02
不明
But you as marketers have the ability to learn and improve and actually, you know, make changes and optimize what you create. So this is what the content supply chain looks like in our world and how we connect all these pieces together. If you can skip to the next slide. There we go. We didn't we didn't work through like, we should have been, we should be like a keyword.

00:07:36:03 - 00:08:01:00
不明
I'm a baseball fan, too. I should have had some baseball signals to alert the slides. This is how we look at content supply chain. There's a lot of similar things to being a rock star. And this is how we can help you be a rock star, right? We want. We want our customers to understand how to collaborate as a team and plan to make sure the entire ecosystem is working together in order to deliver, and create and deliver the content end to end.

00:08:01:03 - 00:08:19:25
不明
And that's what's very interesting around assets, which is why we're going to talk about this around assets, because the creative and production piece, I mean, Adobe is the industry leader in creative tools, and it's all about creating assets and then being able to store them and protect those assets and treat them with value because they're important to your business.

00:08:19:27 - 00:08:37:21
不明
Being able to deliver that to customers and to gain insights in order to optimize and improve. So this is what we're building and the vision that we have in order to help our customers go from an idea of an asset all the way through producing and creating it and delivering it and understanding how it performs. And this is a growing part of our business.

00:08:37:21 - 00:08:56:06
不明
So I'm sure you've heard a lot about this already. It's my favorite topic. And through this presentation, I'm going to jump in and talk more about little pieces of this and how it relates to the lessons that Jonathan is going to walk through. Thank you very much. There you go. Okay. I'm going to start with lesson one.

00:08:56:08 - 00:09:24:04
不明
And this is perhaps the biggest trap of all, but we're going to see, and that's confusing volume with value. Because it's, it's really, really exciting once you get this technology in your hand, because you realize you can suddenly create thousands and thousands of assets in minutes at a relatively low cost. And you can get very easily carried away.

00:09:24:06 - 00:09:58:09
不明
The temptation is to push as many variations as much content through this technology as possible, and assume really that more means better. And the key lesson is just because you can doesn't mean that you should. Because more assets doesn't necessarily mean better results. And as we started to generate a high volume of assets, we quickly realized something very, very important that we just weren't getting the impacts that we thought we're going to do just by creating more and more and more.

00:09:58:11 - 00:10:28:08
不明
Sometimes it meant that we were just creating more noise and we were competing for attention and not necessarily making the impacts that we wanted to. A good example of this is some work that we did for Polaroid. Polaroid always run a campaign towards the end of the year between Thanksgiving and Christmas. It's really the key peak period where they're doing a lot of their sales and a lot of our revenue, and they needed quite a lot of assets for all the different channels that they're looking to promote their products on.

00:10:28:08 - 00:10:53:12
不明
For that, that key sales period. And with such a wide range of products available, there was a temptation of, okay, we'll just put all the products images in, all the benefits and features, and we'll just create all these assets and put them out there. But that's not really what we did. Instead, we started with a very, very clear strategy of actually what a testing framework would be.

00:10:53:12 - 00:11:21:04
不明
So starting with a testing framework, what are the key parameters, what the key areas of the asset which we think would actually make an impact on sales and click through rates. And this could be messaging. What resonated best, what the creative elements like the color, the photos, the typography, the calls to action an obvious one, what works, what doesn't work, and different visual styles, the different visual styles worked better across different platforms.

00:11:21:06 - 00:11:52:29
不明
And we created a really small number of assets to quickly test and validate which ones actually works and which ones didn't. And then we used that data once we knew what elements were having the biggest impact, that's when we started to create variations based on those key things. So to do that we used recent AI, to look at all the different test images we put out there.

00:11:53:01 - 00:12:14:16
不明
Was there some correlation on over a thousand assets? Kind of the key things which were making the click through rate go. Is it a red background? Is it a green background? Is it the text? Is it the image. And then as I say, that's when we did the scaling. And what did it mean. Which meant actually we created fewer assets but much better performance.

00:12:14:18 - 00:12:40:21
不明
We focused the budget in creating, proven winners because we knew with a degree of certainty that actually those are ones which would scale better. We had the prediction on the creative effectiveness to improve the ROI. And really, crucially, we weren't relying on media spend to fix bad creative. We weren't just throwing budget at media, say, just push it out everywhere and see what works.

00:12:40:23 - 00:13:12:14
不明
We were very, very targeted and strategic with which creative would work on which channel. So just because automation enables you to produce a million assets, as I say, it doesn't mean that you should, start small, test, learn, and then scale. Because testing isn't about making more, it's just making smarter. And I really like, the thinking about how value exists within assets you create and making sure you use them in the best way possible.

00:13:12:16 - 00:13:43:17
不明
So I like to think of the fact that your assets that you create and pay or pay a lot of money to have created that carry your brand identity, well, they're actually assets as well. So your assets are assets. I like the little spin on the word there. See what I did there. Yeah. So when you look at it you think about, you know, like I said, you're spending a whole lot of money on assets, you know, going through brand guidelines and all kinds of brand work and creating, you know, very important hero assets to get used and are meant to be used.

00:13:43:19 - 00:14:04:03
不明
There's a ton of value in that. And, their assets and that's actual value. They should be considered valuable and you should treat them as if they're valuable, because the money that you invest in creating your assets create value for your company, and you need to make sure you utilize them well and treat them as value and make sure that you don't waste.

00:14:04:05 - 00:14:25:09
不明
There shouldn't be any waste in the assets you should create. You should reuse as much as you possibly can and optimize what you've used, and you should allow for quick iterations. And that's what GDI and automation is. What's there to help you do right? Make the most out of what you've created. Take those assets as a value and don't treat it as some commodity and asset management system shouldn't be treated that way.

00:14:25:09 - 00:14:43:16
不明
It should be treated as the place to really manage and keep track of the value of what you create and the assets that represent your brand, and all the messaging and communications that you want to have with your customers. Couldn't agree more that assets like rock stars, by the way, are always rocks. They have very big assets, very important stuff.

00:14:43:16 - 00:15:07:23
不明
They create. Okay, second lesson quality and quality out. We learned this the hard way. For a long time we were focused on the templates and those data feeds, really optimizing them, making sure they were creatively as strong as possible, making sure we had lots of different variations. And we said, okay, we'll fix the issues afterwards.

00:15:07:23 - 00:15:32:20
不明
If there's any issues, we'll QA will QC it before it goes out. And so our mindset is very reactive. It wasn't proactive. It was I will just fix stuff as it appears and everything will be fine. And we'll catch mistakes later. The result is just a very large volume of assets riddled with errors. So I definitely wouldn't recommend that approach.

00:15:32:20 - 00:15:58:15
不明
Again, because a mistake is multiplied thousands of times across thousands of versions. If you get a typo and suddenly it's in 2000 assets, which you then have to go back and fix. So we spent a huge amount of time and QA resources manually checking those things after they've been created, combing through each files, trying to find the errors.

00:15:58:23 - 00:16:20:29
不明
And it became quite a neverending process of trying to. It's like a whac-a-mole you think you fix something and something else pops up in that you've got to fix. And actually, more importantly, we we calculated we actually spent 25% of the overall budget on fixing problems which we had created ourselves. Which isn't ideal. And that's when it really, really clicked.

00:16:20:29 - 00:16:44:28
不明
We were doing it wrong. And with automation, bad inputs don't just stay bad. They multiply exponentially. And then a few years ago, Zalando came along and they said to us, right guys, we want 0% defect rate. We don't want final QC QC checks, quality control checks and we want no manual checking and we want okay. That's a challenge.

00:16:45:00 - 00:17:08:20
不明
How are we going to do this. And at first it seemed quite impossible. But then actually we realized we just need to do the QC check at the start, not at the end. And we were absolutely obsessed with trying to prevent errors in the data feeds and the templates. And that, that, that covered a number of different things.

00:17:08:20 - 00:17:24:28
不明
Number one, we had to plan for every different scenario upfront. These were things like, okay, when we translate the asset into different languages, how do we how do we do line breaks? If the text wraps onto trains, are we going to try and wrap the text, or are we going to shrink the text down? How is that going to work?

00:17:25:02 - 00:17:48:15
不明
We're quite obsessive about that. How a product shocks shown a pair of sneakers is very different to a nail polish. And how do we crop those images? So they look like they've been done and then in an intentional way, and not just that, okay, that kind of works. And it kind of fits. And we just spent a lot of time thinking about every single possible thing that could go wrong.

00:17:48:18 - 00:18:08:26
不明
We built rules, we built constraints, we built contingency plans, trying to think about every edge case and really future proofing the templates as much as possible. And what that meant is, when we hit the render button to create all the assets, we knew pretty much exactly what we were going to be. We had confidence, there was no guesswork, there was no surprises.

00:18:08:26 - 00:18:39:04
不明
And we were pretty confident about what we're going to create for our oh, so really the takeaway here is the power of automation isn't just the speed and scale, but also the reliability and the predictability that it brings when creating the assets. And the only way to do this is to ponder obsessively and eliminate the errors, upfront and invest in the right people who actually have knowledge about doing this.

00:18:39:04 - 00:19:04:09
不明
And so know the things to look out for, and build really airtight processes so that everything is checked in from We've also recently developed an AI QC checker. So we run our data feeds through this checker. And it knows things like text lengths and how to how to do things. So we're trying to automate as much as possible with actually the feed creation as much as the the rendering of the assets itself.

00:19:04:12 - 00:19:20:21
不明
Yeah. So in this case I'm going to talk just for a moment. Although I could spend an hour and a half on this topic, but I promise I won't talk that long on this gin studio for performance marketing, because this is a new product that we've launched that you've probably obviously seen about it on, keynote and mainstage and stuff over the past couple days.

00:19:20:23 - 00:19:45:22
不明
But this takes this idea of quality, and reliability into a very specific product launch that we have. And in this case, this product is a generic first application, to create content quickly, and to be able to take that content and created for very personalized groups of people, or brands, make sure that everything is on brand guidelines that gets created.

00:19:45:24 - 00:20:16:24
不明
So you have, the reliability to make sure any piece of content that's created in this, tool matches your brand guidelines and is compliant for what your brand needs. And then what's even more important is, when you activate the content that gets created, you're able to then get insights back and actually improve and optimize it. So, you know, part of the process of having reliable content is also fixing it and tweaking it and improving it, and not having content that isn't reliable assets and content out in space that should be changed and improved, right?

00:20:16:24 - 00:20:42:28
不明
So we wanted to have a product that takes a very, you know, straight beginning to end for what a performance marketer needs for paid social ads or for email creation, and do this in a very reliable way, but leverage AI in order to create this. So there's this balance of being able to utilize, AI in order to create your content, but have some reliability to what gets created, and then to be able to have humans and people involved in order to optimize and change in the future.

00:20:42:28 - 00:21:09:00
不明
So this is all part of kind of if you take this and extrapolate what we're doing across a lot of different products, that's exactly part of the vision. But it's very clearly, you know, articulated and how this product works. So we're really excited about what this is able to do in order to bring more reliability and bring more value, to how we can leverage AI through the life cycle of paid media campaigns or email creation.

00:21:09:03 - 00:21:32:27
不明
Okay. Third one, it's really about managing the entire workflow and not just the creation of the assets. So a lot of this, as I said before, we get very excited about automating the content creation stage, the asset creation stage. But then we forget what comes next. And if you don't rethink your workflows, automation won't save time.

00:21:33:02 - 00:22:00:02
不明
What it is, it just pushes a bottleneck further down the process. And it's going to catch you later on. And that's because existing processes are built really around creating smaller volumes of assets. And when working at scale, you've got questions like, how do I get all my stakeholders not to to validate and test and feedback on 20 assets or 30 assets, but 3000 assets or 5000 assets?

00:22:00:08 - 00:22:26:29
不明
And it's a very, very different problem. And we have a client or had a client have a client who the the way that they used to do it was to manage it in a good old Excel spreadsheets. And that was completely manageable with 30 assets. It was fine. But we did a campaign for them, and it created 7000 assets, and they were video assets, 32nd video assets.

00:22:27:01 - 00:22:46:20
不明
And it was across ten different local markets. So it was ten different marketing managers who had to approve it. And they had this big spreadsheet. It had 7000 rows. And we call it the rainbow spreadsheet, because every market decided to color code it in a different color. And then they added their feedback for every single asset about what was right and which was wrong.

00:22:46:22 - 00:23:15:18
不明
And it was absolute chaos. We missed approvals. It had conflicting feedback, but the designers who were trying to fix those just didn't know why things were, and it was slow. It was stressful, and it completely undermined the reason we were doing the automation in the first place. And so really the lesson here is the tech that manages the workflow is just as important as the technology that creates the assets themselves.

00:23:15:21 - 00:23:34:12
不明
And we have fixed this for a in a number of different cases. This is, an example for smart, where we use, we used Adobe work for it to do this particular thing. Everything is in one place. It's centralized. All the assets are in a digital asset management system. He's got full version control.

00:23:34:17 - 00:23:53:08
不明
And most importantly, particularly for the marketing editors, they have contextual feedback. Instead of leaving their comment in a row in a spreadsheet, they highlight visually what's wrong. Found the comment. They hit the send button and the designer knows exactly what to fix when they say it.

00:23:53:11 - 00:24:33:00
不明
So automation is about the whole creative lifecycle, not just the asset creation part. Just like rock stars, right? It's the whole cycle. And this is an example of kind of unifying the creation and production workflow within the context of Gene studio for performance marketing. Again. Right. And if you look at all these different steps from kicking off a campaign to creative to reviewing and approving all this, it's a number of different teams and stakeholders that are working to deliver this collaboratively for the same goal, trying to go from having a paid media campaign, an idea about what that needs to do that will begin in some kind of brief for kickoff and then being able

00:24:33:00 - 00:24:52:06
不明
to, in the end, actually get it out there, make a difference, see conversions, understand what's working, and then optimize again. So this flow is a perfect example in a very small world of how you need to have workflows and have teams collaborating together, working towards the same goal in a simple and seamless way in order to move quickly.

00:24:52:08 - 00:25:10:01
不明
Because one of the big objectives is to reduce time and move very, very fast. And so I think this is also interesting on this slide because here we talk about oh, there's actually three builds. You can go ahead and build the whole thing. You can go to the next two and just put the whole thing up there. So in this case this is an example of different teams.

00:25:10:01 - 00:25:32:20
不明
002 for visualize. There we go. Oh I thought there was a there we go. So that we didn't practice this part. No there's more than one. Sorry. No, there was a issue of getting, the slides over to each other. It's unfortunately, it's not seamless when collaborating on slides. I can tell you that across countries and stuff as well.

00:25:32:20 - 00:25:52:21
不明
But, so in this case, if we just, like, double click on the idea of where you're actually dealing with the content production element of this full flow, even this has different people in different teams and in our case, different products that are delivering. How do you scale, asset production as you need to, in order to grow very quickly and leverage scale?

00:25:52:24 - 00:26:10:12
不明
How do you actually utilize that and make the right decisions when you're creating the performance marketing campaign, along with all the assets that you've already built? And then how do you then, you know, actually leverage some of those same assets in a simpler last mile way for a company and empower more people to be able to contribute to this process.

00:26:10:12 - 00:26:31:08
不明
So that's a big piece of collaboration and workflows, is how do you allow more people in your business to actually be part of the content creation lifecycle? And by creating transparency and easy ways for people to collaborate together, it's easier to then increase those that are contributing to the content. And that's part of the vision of what we want to be able to enable.

00:26:31:10 - 00:27:00:12
不明
Okay. For for an experiment boldly because failure fuels growth. That's one of the headings I just thought perhaps it should said it's a marathon, not a sprint. The same sort of, the same sort of approach. Creative automation is still evolving. I think we've seen that if you were at something last year or the year before, kind of the innovations with Gen Studio, as Joshua was talking about, it's evolving very, very, very quickly.

00:27:00:15 - 00:27:26:09
不明
And the companies who are leading in this space, waiting for it to be perfect or planning for it to be perfect. They're the ones who are willing to invest, to experiment, to see what works, what doesn't work, and take few risks and learn as they go. Because the most important thing when implementing, creative automation is not just the tools, it's actually the mindset.

00:27:26:12 - 00:27:46:14
不明
It's how you think about things. It's how you think about the experimentation, how you think about creating all the assets, which is a very different way than you probably have done in the past. And this is probably the best example we have of the marathon sprint, which is just the takeaway. Just a takeaway. A food delivery service.

00:27:46:17 - 00:28:10:16
不明
And we've been working with them for just over three years on what we call Project Sunday and Project some days, that creative automation project, how do we scale all these different assets? When we first started working with them, we launched in one markets, one country market in Europe. And we only did, CRM assets. It went really, really well the first time we did it.

00:28:10:23 - 00:28:34:00
不明
And so we said, okay, why don't we scale out to 15 different markets? What if we expand from CRM to paid media as well? And it really, really exploded. It exploded from, from a couple of campaigns. We're running a month to, you know, creating thousands of thousands of assets that we're doing, doing every month. But the question I always ask myself is kind of, why are they continue to do it now?

00:28:34:00 - 00:29:02:04
不明
It's very, very cost effective. And we're creating lots and lots of different assets. But it's not just the cost effectiveness, it's actually the information that then learning about what's working and not what's not working. I think my favorite anecdote on this is or favorite fact is that in the UK, where I'm based, burgers, photos of burgers, I'm not ads convert much better than pizzas.

00:29:02:06 - 00:29:19:18
不明
And that's not the same for every market. And that's actually very valuable information when you're thinking about the next round of assets that you're going to create. If I want to get a particular type of click through rate or particular behavior, what actually performs best in what's different market. So it's not just a an investment in creating the assets.

00:29:19:18 - 00:29:44:11
不明
It's actually an investment in learning what works and what doesn't work. And now we run experiments pretty regularly to make sure that they're keeping on top of trends and making sure that we're investing in the right templates and the right approach is, making the best return on this big investment they've made over the past three years to create all these different thousands of assets.

00:29:44:14 - 00:30:15:10
不明
And it's because they were in it for the long run, and they invested accordingly, because it's very easy to get a little bit disheartened when an experiment doesn't work, because not every experiment will succeed. But if you learn from each failure, it is a step forward in the right direction. So looking again at Gene Studio Performance Marketing as a good example, we wanted to build a way to test and experiment with more content, create, more content variations easily.

00:30:15:13 - 00:30:43:05
不明
And so with with this tool, the idea is we're able to create a number of variations of content that you can choose from, via AI that does this creation for you. And then you can very quickly test to understand how things are going and optimize. So Adobe has been using this ourselves, and we've seen a massive improvement in quality of conversions by being able to understand what works all the way down to an attribute of an image.

00:30:43:05 - 00:31:14:07
不明
So maybe we can learn that images that are in the daytime or better performing than images that are in the nighttime, certain colors perform better than other colors, any kind of attribute of an image, but being able to test new variations of that easily and then very quickly refresh to see how well that works. So this idea of being able to work in a more agile way and test variations and optimize is critical in order to be successful, especially with, in the case of this, things like paid media, which needs to be very fresh and refreshed quickly and optimized.

00:31:14:12 - 00:31:36:16
不明
And so this is all, meant to look at three things that we're trying to solve, right? How to you automate the creation and create the volume that's quality and of the value, as we discussed already. How do you do this? By reducing time that it takes to actually create content. And how do you manage costs in this way.

00:31:36:18 - 00:31:59:23
不明
And if you can control these things while increasing value, reducing time and helping to manage your costs, you can actually optimize and move and test variations. But if you can't do these things, it's very difficult, to go through a testing pattern because if it takes too long or you're not able to create the volume, you need to be able to test all the things you want to test, then it's very difficult to achieve that.

00:31:59:23 - 00:32:17:00
不明
So by hitting on these three topics, you're able to open up the window of being able to do so much more and test variation and see what works and improve conversions. And that's exactly what we want to achieve and how we're looking at AI in our products, like studio for Performance Marketing.

00:32:17:03 - 00:32:46:00
不明
Okay. This one I think is the most important, because for all the the automation, all the AI, all the efficiency gains that we've talked about today, there's a thing the machines can't replace and that's, that's human creativity. A common misconception that we hear when we're presenting demos, way of creative automation, is that automating content is removing creativity altogether.

00:32:46:02 - 00:33:10:19
不明
And that can be further from the truth. And we hear that more and more, especially as gen AI creeps in. That it will just generate the content for us. It will automatically optimize performance. Humans won't be needed anymore at any stage. But automation doesn't replace creativity. It really does enhance it and actually give us more opportunities to be creative in some cases.

00:33:10:21 - 00:33:42:04
不明
And this is probably my favorite, favorite example of that. It's a zipper zipper. It's a housing marketplace, based in the UK. And key to the creative idea isn't the template, but just a template where the template was really, really nice. The creativity is actually in the data feed. Probably the thing that people think is the more boring part because zipper, because they're selling houses or advertising houses for sale, it's it's super niche, from a location perspective.

00:33:42:06 - 00:34:11:20
不明
And they want to make sure that every paid artwork they're showing to a, to a potential customer, is super relevant to them. And that's because housing prices, housing availability and supply, different things that are important to different people vary a lot from location to location. And instead of having a generic brand message to put out there, they really want it to be super, super targeted based on the particular location someone is.

00:34:11:23 - 00:34:49:13
不明
So we actually used data, not just messaging or creative messaging. We actually use real data. So we got to average house prices. We actually went to public access with data like, school availability in a particular area or school ratings in a particular area, which is publicly available data, and based on the user and where they, where they are when they're looking at the ad or where we think that they are, we actually show them an ad which has been created for their specific zip code or postcode in the UK, with the relevant house price, and anything else which we think is really important in the area that they live in.

00:34:49:16 - 00:35:30:13
不明
And that means we've generated thousands of super localized assets. So not just from a country perspective, but from a very, very localized perspective. And it's not just this isn't about automation for just efficiency sake. It's actually automation for a bit of creative idea. It's strategic personalization, not just for scale. And this comes back to the point that smart automation, which I mentioned before, isn't about making more assets, it's about making more relevance, more effective and more strategic assets.

00:35:30:16 - 00:35:53:02
不明
All right. So I'm going to tell a story instead of reading a slide because I like stories. How many people first have experimented with Firefly at this point? Everybody should be all right okay. Anybody who has a raise their hand in the room tonight play with Firefly. So I'm going to tell a story because I think what it represents is the accessible to creativity that Firefly and these tools can bring.

00:35:53:05 - 00:36:16:21
不明
So at Christmas time my daughter is learning to be she's studying to be a teacher. So we live in Denmark as mentioned, but we're American, as you probably can tell. And she's, learning to be a teacher. She wants to teach English in Danish school. And so she's working with little kids. And so at Christmas, we were with my brother's little kids, my niece and nephew and my sister trying to get her get them excited, and do something other than play and run around like little kids.

00:36:16:24 - 00:36:39:11
不明
Said, let's write a story together. So they wrote a Christmas story and they read it. And I thought it was really interesting and very creative. And I said, well, why don't we sit down and break this up into sections and go into Firefly and take those sections that you've written and use those as prompts and create images and actually make a little book about a Christmas story to give to your parents when they get they were gone, when they come back as a Christmas present.

00:36:39:14 - 00:36:59:22
不明
So then we sat down and spent like two hours with the little kids going through creating all these images. And when we created each image, it actually unlocked a new layer of creativity in them that started to modify and make the story even better, because they started to visualize some of what they'd come up with. So just little kids, that was it.

00:36:59:22 - 00:37:16:23
不明
They were able to unlock a new level of creativity by using something like Firefly. It just opened up something new. They were able to think differently and work differently. And in the end, we produced this really cool story with a bunch of pictures and printed it out and gave it to their parents for Christmas. I hope they liked it.

00:37:16:23 - 00:37:38:27
不明
I don't know my brother. He's not as enthusiastic, I don't know, I'm not going to complain about it anyway. I think he liked it, but it was a ton of fun and it just kind of, to me, really open the idea that somebody's a little kid that doesn't have any preconceived notion of what creativity should be or what anything should be started to think differently because this was assessable to them and allowed them to be much more creative.

00:37:38:27 - 00:37:59:08
不明
And that's what we see, when we work with teams at Adobe. And we think about this not just in, little kids, but how this becomes very enterprise in a business is more people can contribute to what creativity means via these tools because you start to think differently. You approach problems differently, and you can in fact become much more creative.

00:37:59:08 - 00:38:18:00
不明
And that's what we want to do, is have humans in the middle to be able to launch more creativity and have more people contributing to the process of creating content. And maybe one day these little niece and nephews will do that. I don't know, we'll see. But, so that's the way I like to think about what humans sitting at the heart of creativity can mean, right?

00:38:18:03 - 00:38:49:16
不明
And using Genii to unlock a whole bunch of new ideas that maybe otherwise wouldn't have even come to them right? Yeah. Okay. That's our five lessons. I hope you found them valuable in some way. Especially if you're just embarking, on your creative automation journey, or looking to scale up. I think the final takeaway is, it's back to this all to make smarter, not just faster.

00:38:49:18 - 00:39:24:06
不明
The best creative automation isn't just about scaling production. It's about solving creative challenges using technology and in more intelligent ways. It's not about removing humans at all. It's really about enhancing and elevating what they can do. And with the limited resources and time that they have available to them to create these sorts of assets. Small art at the end, we've done this a lot, as hopefully you've seen, we make creative automation smarter.
