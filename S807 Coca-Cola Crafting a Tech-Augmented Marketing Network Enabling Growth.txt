00:00:00:01 - 00:00:23:36

Hello, everybody. I am Ryan Houseman. I am in marketing capabilities at the Coca-Cola company. I am joined with Mallory Meisner, who is a hero of mine and marketing operations as well as well as Ashish Noria from the Adobe product team. And we are here to talk a little bit about how we are transforming ways of working with work front at its backbone at the Coca-Cola company.

00:00:23:45 - 00:00:29:19
不明
There we go. Yeah. All right.

00:00:29:24 - 00:00:54:34
不明
All right, so we are on a journey, and we have been on a journey for the past four or so years now to transform our marketing organization, not by a little, but by a lot. We are objective more than anything, is to become the world's best marketing organization by a long shot. And we have a couple of behaviors that we ask of our associates, all of our marketeers, in order to bring that to life.

00:00:54:39 - 00:01:19:40
不明
Number one is making sure that we are continuing to work together, driving collaboration and co-creation wherever humanly possible. Two, that we are focusing relentlessly on learning, and down at the bottom here, it's reducing duplication of effort as much as humanly possible. That is the bane of this, bane of our existence in a large organization, in an enterprise like Coca-Cola.

00:01:19:40 - 00:01:54:15
不明
And so making sure that we are doing work once, not 7 or 9 different times, is what we're always focusing and striving for. So why did we identify that we needed to transform, to set a little bit of big picture context before we get into the sort of piece of the role that work front plays in this for us is this five year journey started during the pandemic as we identified one we needed to dramatically accelerate, our ability to recruit consumers through a much more streamlined portfolio of brands.

00:01:54:19 - 00:02:19:50
不明
There is a massive shift in that we all feel every single day and how consumers actually engage with media. So we had to massively shift from traditional media to much more digital led experiences and integrated experiences. And then the last one is that before the pandemic or before Covid, we had over 6000 marketing agencies that we worked with across the globe.

00:02:19:55 - 00:02:47:01
不明
So we really tried to focus on a new operating model with DPI in order to balance the scale that we are looking for, reducing duplication of effort and balancing that need with intimacy in each individual local market. As again, at the end of the day, our business happens in each local market and each local outlet, and, we need partners that are going to continue to bring that to life every day.

00:02:47:06 - 00:03:13:21
不明
And so a couple of things that we anchor on is the idea of a network model. So why a network instead of a matrix organization versus hierarchy. If you were in the town hall yesterday or the keynote speech yesterday, James mentioned that his first day as CEO of our company, he wore jeans and a jacket, not drinking Coca-Cola.

00:03:13:26 - 00:03:42:43
不明
We were a very, very rigid, hierarchical, chart of authority driven organization in the past. I actually remember one of my first days when I started in sales, I used to manage a bunch of local outlets in Buckhead, and our old CEO actually came into a store with a color card to measure whether or not the products that we were selling on shelves and the the messaging was actually Coca-Cola Red or not.

00:03:42:48 - 00:04:06:00
不明
And that was just the way that things were. So we moved away from a hierarchical organization, instead of a matrix organization, which a lot of, companies do, where you've got functional reporting lines as well as project based working, like, reporting lines, where associates oftentimes get stuck between functional requirements or functional direction and project based direction.

00:04:06:05 - 00:04:33:34
不明
We decided to really identify a network model where we could one prioritize speed and flexibility. Number two is that we forced the organization to collaborate and co-create by design. So we there starved resources at the center, in our center functions that have to partner with each of our marketeers and each of the markets to bring their ideas to life.

00:04:33:39 - 00:04:59:40
不明
And then three, really focus on specialization and centers of excellence where it really makes sense. So this is the way that we have been working for the past four years, across our 1600 marketing associates. And the rest of our structure as well. And what makes us complicated, and what makes marketing operations complicated and getting work done?

00:04:59:45 - 00:05:39:47
不明
Across our 1600 people every year, recognizing that, there are about 750,000 total associates when you take into account our franchise bottlers, that interact with customers and, and consumers every single day. One, we execute about 3000 different projects every single year and even split between new products, new packages, as well as marketing campaigns. So a very large number of campaigns, new products, innovations that are brought to market every single year, we have just under 200 brands, that operate in over 200 markets across the globe.

00:05:39:52 - 00:06:03:43
不明
So when you think about a large number of brand, programs that are happening across a large number of markets, it becomes a matrix and a web of, what content is needed for watch market when, milestone tracking becomes incredibly important for us. And in the past five years, we have spent about $35 billion in DME.

00:06:03:48 - 00:06:39:29
不明
And then you throw on top of that what our bottlers spend, our franchise spend in each market. This is just the Coca-Cola company spend at that. Which is really responsible for marketing the, the brands. And you know, what we're going to focus on, as well as the concentrate, the sirup that we produce, that our bottlers and our distributors produce physically put in packages and ship out to outlets, spend a tremendous amount of money, across all of those brands, across all of those campaigns, constantly looking for efficiency and effectiveness.

00:06:39:34 - 00:07:10:10
不明
And so as part of this transformation, we decided that we were going to start augmenting our ways of working overall. So when you think about our transition from a matrix organization and a hierarchical organization in some functions, to a network, what we identified very quickly is that our processes, our tools that we used, the decision rights and how decisions were actually made, weren't fit for purpose and weren't fit for growth.

00:07:10:17 - 00:07:35:18
不明
So we decided that we were going to really focus on digitizing work on a couple of key focus areas. Number one, we want to help our associates deliver better work. We believe creativity is a central part of that, but it's better quality content, better quality activations, done faster. And our cheeky little take on it is that it should be work, should be fun.

00:07:35:18 - 00:08:01:30
不明
So we need to make sure that, this is an enjoyable experience for all of us as well. So what we are constantly focusing on is these three goals. And so with that, I will transition over to Mallory to start talking about our journey with the work front. Awesome. Thanks, Ryan. So we've talked a little bit about technology or ways of working, how we started to transform into a network.

00:08:01:30 - 00:08:32:39
不明
So I'm going to share a little bit more about what we actually mean when we say tech augmented ways of working. So we're really focused on how are we building a connected marketing ecosystem. So the first piece of that is on connecting work. So this is really where work front really leans in. So going all the way from ideation prioritization all the way to execution really using that to bring our work to life.

00:08:32:43 - 00:09:10:18
不明
But the second piece of that is really connecting experience for our marketing associates. So creating an ecosystem that allows them to utilize technology effectively to make their work easier, better, faster, hopefully with some fun along the way. So bringing together how the process works, where they can connect to other experts communities of practice, where they can get more details on Nielsen data on our end consumer really bringing everything they need into one ecosystem.

00:09:10:22 - 00:09:35:57
不明
The third piece then is on solutions. So while we can really control a good bit of how the work is orchestrated, we also need to connect with other pieces of the Coca-Cola system. So whether that's our financial systems, our analytics, how we're doing in the market, making sure that we're using seamless integrations to really bring all of that to life.

00:09:36:01 - 00:10:05:48
不明
And then the last piece is on connecting capabilities. So while we talk a good bit around this is going to help us do this work faster really increase efficiency and effectiveness. We want to embed learning and capability building with our associates along the way. So it's not just on internal delivery, but also how are we helping the associates at Coca-Cola learn and grow as we do our work?

00:10:05:52 - 00:10:39:36
不明
So to start out with all of this, we obviously start from ideas and prioritizing. So starting from strategy, we look at what are the opportunity spaces that we have, do ideation around those opportunity spaces. And even do some quick validation with consumers to understand if we are really focusing on the places that are going to drive lots of effectiveness and impact at scale across the marketing organization.

00:10:39:41 - 00:11:05:33
不明
From that, we start to use work front and we start to collect ideas against those opportunity spaces, against our various brands, against the different platforms that we have and really start to have a good list of all of our opportunities. And then we've identified some key metrics that really help us to prioritize those opportunities once they're prioritized.

00:11:05:47 - 00:11:38:24
不明
We have a great healthy backlog in work front that is really allowing us to have visibility across the organization of all of the ways that we could bring things to life. And then from there, we're making sure that we are actually scaling those for impact. So are we focusing on the right priorities, the right combinations in the right markets, making sure that we're pairing all of that together to really ensure that we have impact across the organization.

00:11:38:29 - 00:12:07:32
不明
So then we start to execute all of those ideas. So we have them in work front, and then we start to really lean in to kind of the core capability of that tool work orchestration. As Ryan talked about, we have a very complex organization. So we have global categories, we have operating units, we have markets, and then we have 200 brands that are happening across those 200 plus markets.

00:12:07:37 - 00:12:34:12
不明
So we really needed this tool to help us keep all of that in order and orchestrate all of the work. And that's where it's really, really helped us is now we're able to connect things that are the same. So easy to understand. Coca-Cola, Christmas, things that we do every year that are like that are going to be activated in a similar way across markets, using a similar tone of voice.

00:12:34:17 - 00:13:12:38
不明
We can connect all of that. But also allow some local regional nuances to be captured. But the thing that work front has really helped us with is building that one approach to marketing. So we're able to ensure that the components that keep us consumer centric are really embedded into the work, into our templates, that it's data driven that as we're doing our different phases of building the marketing experience, that we're bringing in the right data on our consumers, on our customers, that we're really doing this in a networked fashion.

00:13:12:39 - 00:13:38:37
不明
I think there's been a lot of statistics around asset utilization reuse. So how do we ensure that we are not duplicating efforts, but we're doing this in a networked way, really having transparency and consistency in how we do that. And then that is getting us to effectiveness at scale and really having one voice. So all of that sounds great.

00:13:38:42 - 00:14:01:24
不明
I will tell you, we did learn along the way. So occasionally we are building the plane as we are flying it. The first piece that we really started to learn on, is what we call dynamic project structure. So a Cece will break that down for you a little bit more in a few minutes. But that is the hierarchy that we use within work front.

00:14:01:24 - 00:14:26:18
不明
So it is you using the portfolio program project structure. But we quickly learned that all of our things don't neatly fit into that. So some examples that you might think of could be like FIFA, Olympics, things that are going across different portfolios, different brand. We needed a way to actually have all of that coordinate within our tool.

00:14:26:18 - 00:15:01:22
不明
So as she she's going to break down how we're doing all of that. But that's really been something that work front and fusion has really helped us to drive by giving us that flexibility to really automate and connect the varying pieces of the work together. And then also learning on the job, being able to build templates within the tool, being able to customize those templates for various operating units, markets, things that are nuanced across, different regulatory requirements.

00:15:01:22 - 00:15:27:21
不明
All of that we've able to build within the tool. And that's really been useful for us also building in nudges and ways for our associates to learn along the way. So as we start to kind of wrap up this section, the key thing that we're focused on within this is how do we really break down the silo of work and learning.

00:15:27:36 - 00:16:02:06
不明
So for us, tech augmented ways of working is really reaching that ultimate goal of how do we break those down and make them be interconnected? A continuous loop that's happening. So as we have all of the work coming to life and work front, as we're prioritizing, as we're then determining the resources needed to deliver the work, have the process clearly defined, whether it's a marketing experience or an innovation project, we're also building learning along the way.

00:16:02:06 - 00:16:33:49
不明
So we're ensuring that we are injecting capabilities that our associates are able to build their own experience, profile, understand areas where they can learn and grow, see projects and opportunities that have that, and then partner with other people through communities of practice. And really putting our marketeers at the center to ensure that we are not separating work and learning, but that it's interconnected across the system.

00:16:33:54 - 00:17:03:27
不明
So then the last piece is really on the game changers and accelerators for doing that. So we know that about 75% of learning is done on the job. Does anyone know how much learning you lose after about 24 hours of taking some kind of training? I heard 90. That's very close. So, after about a week, you lose 90% of it.

00:17:03:32 - 00:17:28:27
不明
After about 24 hours, you're losing about 70% of it. So that's something that has really been an accelerator and game changer for us, is being able to bring that right at the point that our marketeers need it, so that they're learning it and then immediately applying it. So really that stickiness factor is happening. We're focused on doing that through AI, also through personalization.

00:17:28:28 - 00:17:53:48
不明
So there's so much information that we can have. We're really trying to ensure that we're connecting information, democratizing information. Removing kind of the tribal knowledge that you previously would need to have within an organization. But in doing that, you then need to be able to pare that down and really personalize and have it to where an associate can see exactly what they need.

00:17:53:49 - 00:18:21:18
不明
So based on various job roles or interest, actually building in personalization for the associates as well, integrating so that we can easily know here's what we planned from a strategy perspective. Okay. How are we doing from a budget standpoint. How are we tracking that over time? We said that this program would be effective because it was going to be activated in X number of markets.

00:18:21:23 - 00:18:51:38
不明
Are we actually doing that? So making sure that all of our systems are integrated to really allow that and then ensuring that as we see new capabilities, we're bringing those, in a very thoughtful way to our associates at the right time through the change curve and really bringing them through this with us. So we have a short video to show you some of the capabilities that we have built in work front, and then Ashish will kind of dig into those a little bit further.

00:18:51:43 - 00:19:37:03
不明
Okay. Thank you Mallory. So let's see how is work front driving success within Coca-Cola's marketing network operations? So first of all, work front is the core work orchestration and management solution that connects projects from different organizational levels and help the business share and collaborate. Then there is work from fusion, which serves as an integration platform which extends that work from capabilities through powerful automations and integrations, allowing to connect work front with other Coca-Cola applications and even third party applications.

00:19:37:08 - 00:20:08:46
不明
By automating repetitive tasks, reducing the time spent on, manual effort, and optimizing data processes. It helps work from fusion, helps teams stay efficient and focus on high for high focus work. Work from Data Connect, which is the data Lake solution, is the central repository for marketing data supporting complex analytics which drives data driven decisions.

00:20:08:51 - 00:20:49:00
不明
So these combined elements collectively is driving the success within Coca-Cola's marketing network operations. Now you heard Mallory talk about dynamic project structures. So what are these dynamic project structures or DP's is one of the core capabilities that basically brings synergy and inter operational efficiency between global or you and market level initiatives. It is essentially a multi-layered project hierarchy driven by a combination of both work front and fusion.

00:20:49:04 - 00:21:23:35
不明
It helps connect initiatives by maintaining a hierarchy of execution, brings work traceability and transparency between the global initiatives or You initiatives or market level initiatives. It encourages collaboration between different teams and helps execution and helps with various levels of execution. It maintains a standardized workflow for different types of project executions, while at the same time allowing for customizations at the EU level and at the market level.

00:21:23:40 - 00:22:10:23
不明
It serves as a PMO, simplifying basic project management capabilities. Now let's see what this project hierarchy really looks like. It is essentially a custom framework that builds a multi-layered hierarchy between global or you and market level projects. It brings it allows market. It allows market level markets to be able to be able to leverage the work done by the global initiatives, by joining the initiatives as a participating operating unit or a market, by maintaining a hierarchy between global or you and market initiative, it helps improves internal network collaborations and bring operational synergy across the board.

00:22:10:28 - 00:22:53:21
不明
Now, has anyone wondered? We talked about project structures. So what is the dynamic piece in this? Did anyone wonder. At least one person raise a hand. So let's talk about that dynamics. Say if you are aware of the work front capabilities, we have portfolios, programs and projects. But because of the complexity of the network, the marketing network ops that Mallory and Ryan talked about earlier, we needed a more dynamic structure, which basically you should fit, whether a global charter requires an all to participate or a market to participate, or whether it's just going to be a single market project.

00:22:53:25 - 00:23:21:45
不明
Right. So what we did basically, is that with a combination of work front and fusion and all, you could say, well, okay, there is a global initiative or a global charter, I'm going to join that charter and fusion, depending on certain data or data architecture or data attributes within the, within the project was spin up, an EU level project with its own project template.

00:23:21:50 - 00:23:54:40
不明
And then if a market within that all decides, yes, we are also going to activate this within our market. They can say we are going to do this as a part of this particular EU fusion will then go ahead and spin up a market project with its own template. So essentially, depending upon whether you are a market, whether you're an EU, whether it's a global charter or as an example that Mallory took about FIFA, where you have multiple categories participating for activating a single initiative in multiple markets.

00:23:54:45 - 00:24:17:01
不明
Fusion and working together will create a dynamic project structure. What it does is it helps you visualize where the projects are being activated, at what level, what work is being done at the global level? What work is being done at the EU level, and what work is being done at the market level. It allows the teams to work collaboratively across these initiatives.

00:24:17:06 - 00:24:40:31
不明
So that's where the dynamic piece comes into play. Also another thing to consider here is by standard work for an office portfolio program and projects. However, if you think about here, we're talking about more than three layers of architecture here. So we have portfolio. We have global categories. Then we have global charters. Then we have EU charters, then we have market charters.

00:24:40:31 - 00:25:07:36
不明
We might have single market projects. So all of that. This is where the combination of work front and fusion together. As I said earlier, fusion helps enhance, extend the the capabilities of work front to ought to do all of these things. So that is that is the one single most core capability that Coca-Cola's utilizing for their marketing and network operations.

00:25:07:40 - 00:25:36:43
不明
Now, as we saw in the video earlier, we have also deployed something called gating functionality in work front to streamline the decision making at various stages of the project. Now, meetings and agenda is unmanaged within the tool itself. The pre reads, which is essentially a project brief required for the gate meetings, are generated through fusion automatically. So the fusion scripts would read the data that's being collected for the project at the various different levels.

00:25:36:48 - 00:26:05:00
不明
That data is then consolidated in in a structured template. And the fusion will go ahead and fill in those data points in that template, create a PDF which is then used as a as a pre read. Additionally, it also has the ability to also have the ability to upload additional background information, additional documents which fusion then automatically combined into a single document, creating one single Pre-Read for the stakeholders of that gate.

00:26:05:00 - 00:26:39:26
不明
Meeting to review during the Gate meeting. Working proofing is used to digitize the feedback and reduce meeting times. These capabilities drive efficiencies by reducing manual effort, streamlining decision making, and optimizing meeting times, ultimately leading to fast project execution and time savings and workflow, and provides a centralized system where meeting records, approvals, feedbacks are captured in real time.

00:26:39:31 - 00:27:15:36
不明
Right data, as we all know, is the cornerstone of for strategic decision making, driving efficiencies, innovation and sustainable growth. Now, as the central repository for marketing data work for it enables data governance, which basically ensures compliance and accuracy across the board. Data is pushed in real time to update analytics in part by which then connects other data sets to suggest how projects, how projects are scaling across markets and categories to increase both scale and decrease effort.

00:27:15:41 - 00:27:47:01
不明
It enables real time insights for faster, better, data decisions. It powers automations and integrations to reduce manual effort and data entry processing and sharing. It helps leverage learnings from previous projects to adapt to the current ones for success. In essence, Work Front helps transform data into actionable insights, driving smarter decisions and operational efficiencies.

00:27:47:06 - 00:28:17:30
不明
Someone agrees, I guess that, Now from a maturity perspective, as Ryan mentioned, it's been a very long journey and we have been tracking the maturity as well as as we go across through the journey. So what we do is we try to use a maturity across variety of features to deploy and sustain change. And the maturity model is aligned across feature development, change management and comms.

00:28:17:34 - 00:28:49:45
不明
In this model, we are moving associates from learned, basically starting with the basic capabilities to live it, which is a more targeted adoption and using the tool in their day to day work to love it, which is where they become masters and advocate for the benefits of the tool. The feature roadmap is also aligned to this particular maturity model, to ensure that we're not building tools that are beyond the capabilities of the organization itself.

00:28:49:49 - 00:29:18:20
不明
And with that, I will hand over to Ryan to talk about progress. Yeah. So again, it's it's been, what, 3 or 4 years of a journey. Those of you in the room that are part of the Coca-Cola company know that has been bumpy along the way. We have certainly had, all sorts of learnings made a ton of progress, which is great, but, we're we're I would say we're we're well on our way at this point.

00:29:18:25 - 00:29:48:30
不明
So, a couple of things as we talk about our work stream overall. So number one, as we're talking about the importance of dynamic project structures. Again, if you think back to 2019, or 2018 pre-COVID pre network organization, we had a holiday campaign happening. You would have that holiday campaign developed in North America. You would have that holiday campaign developed in Europe, and probably multiple markets differently within Europe.

00:29:48:30 - 00:30:15:59
不明
You'd have the same thing happen in Latin America. And ultimately we would massively duplicate our nonworking dollars. But we would also, really not create a consistent voice for our own consumers. And so number one thing that we are focused on is making sure that we are linking projects together in that dynamic project structure as much as humanly possible to focus on scale, focus on multi market participation.

00:30:16:13 - 00:30:50:26
不明
And what we've seen in the last even two years alone is that we have seen A3X increase in participation in network projects or multi market projects in nature without really changing the number of true and consumer interactions that we have at a market level. So if you say we, we're still representing and still driving the 3000 projects, but instead of them being 3000 individual activations, they're now it's about a thousand, it's massive, massive efficiencies in terms of how we are driving and executing the work.

00:30:50:31 - 00:31:13:21
不明
We have been able to reduce our meeting times for making decisions again. Network organization and stakeholder management becomes incredibly important to us. We've been able to reduce the amount of time that it takes to align stakeholders and have discussions about what feedback do we need to give to a project team by 50%. So, we are well on our way towards our overall objective.

00:31:13:22 - 00:31:40:10
不明
Again, if we've got a 1600 person marketing organization, we've got about 2000 people, actively using work front, every call it month or so. A lot of them are very heavy users. We've got a lot of light users as well, though. But the objective is, is that we want to be able to give about an hour of time back to each of our associates every single day to allocate towards higher value activities.

00:31:40:15 - 00:32:05:30
不明
And through all of this efficiency that we're driving through our deployment of work front, and this tech augmented ways of working. We're seeing the translation to better outcomes in market as well. So linking it back to our transformation overall, we are recruiting more consumers, pretty consistently. Not a, not only, across all of our established brands, but the new brands and the new products that we launch every year.

00:32:05:34 - 00:32:31:45

We are continuing to see low double digit increases in marketing efficiency and effectiveness. That changes a little bit market to market. But we are making leaps in stride, progress in terms of how we are driving efficiencies in the dollars that we are spending to create content, distribute content, and iterate and leverage what we've already created instead of, relearning things that, we already know.

00:32:31:49 - 00:32:59:53

We're seeing higher success rates. On innovation, it's about A3X increase, campaign effectiveness as well. We're seeing, much higher engagement rates overall. And at the end of the day, we are we've got most of our associates on board with the idea of driving scale, driving that efficiency, and recognizing that I don't have to relearn what was institutional or, as Mallory called it, tribal knowledge in the past.

00:32:59:58 - 00:33:31:33

So if I didn't know that, say, there is one associate left that worked on New Coke back in the 80s, that what is the learning plan associated with that? What are the key insights that we thought we understood before we launched it, or what went wrong in the activation? All of that now is not only documented in insights and analytics, through power BI, but also in work front in order to say this type of project is very similar to something that is already working well in market today.

00:33:31:33 - 00:33:51:54

Are you sure you don't want to just take that and just reduce your operating costs by 20, 30, 40% and increase the amount of time that you could earn, decrease the amount of time that it takes to get something out the door? So it really has been a wonderful journey for us, with a long way to go, though.

00:33:51:59 - 00:34:13:21

I know I am certainly excited about the keynote speeches and the product and future of, work for our Future of work front session that we just sat in. I know that we're going to be keeping our, ACS and product team very busy as we think about rolling out the features that, we saw.

00:34:13:26 - 00:34:40:12

So with that, turn it over to Mallory to talk about where we're going. Thanks. So, lots of progress that we've made, which we're really excited about, but, we know that's really just the tip of the iceberg that technology is rapidly changing and advancing, and we're very excited to continue to mature in how we're utilizing the tool and integrate it across.

00:34:40:17 - 00:35:11:52
不明
So our first thing that we really are focused on is how do we achieve greater maturity. So how do we really look at the vast options of features that we can activate within work front, ensure that we're focusing and then we're moving our users through that, learn it, live it, love it, model, really increasing the maturity of our user base on the things that are going to be most valuable for them, that are really going to have the most benefit for them, and better aligned to our mission of better work.

00:35:11:52 - 00:35:47:37

Faster, easier. The second piece, which I know everyone might be tired of hearing AI, but really, how do we start to utilize AI within our processes? So how are we using AI to really data mine our processes, make our processes more efficient. If our users are constantly skipping over certain tasks, we can really evaluate are those needed? Taking that, as Ryan kind of alluded to, all the way to the beginning of the process, as they're putting in information for a potential opportunity.

00:35:47:41 - 00:36:20:57

Connecting that to say this looks really similar to something that we have done previously. Have you considered that ensuring that we are really considering adaptations, reapplication, reuse. So using all of the technology, the AI to really help us clearly understand that and really shine light on those opportunities? The other thing that has been really exciting that we want to continue to build on is all of the data that this really unlocks for the organization.

00:36:21:01 - 00:36:50:28

This might be shocking for, you know, in over 130 year old company, but we have not had this level of transparency and visibility to our work ever before. So really, for our leadership continuing to have that level of visibility to really understand how we are going from the global network initiatives that we're putting together, how those are actually penetrating down through our operating units and markets.

00:36:50:33 - 00:37:13:29
不明
And then what we're also doing to build upon that for the local needs within those areas to understand how our entire portfolio is coming to life so that we can make informed, data backed decisions about all of the work that we're doing across the marketing network. And then the last piece is, how do we continue to really expand the bounds of where we are?

00:37:13:30 - 00:37:41:03
不明
So right now we're really starting with annual business planning, utilizing the tools to get to that, going all the way through, delivering our marketing experiences, our innovation projects. And then now how do we continue to push past that? How do we have all of the data analytics for everything as it goes to market? Connecting that back to projects, how do we push even further on the front end?

00:37:41:04 - 00:38:05:46
不明
How do we have our long range plans becoming visible sooner so that we are really looking at all of the key performance indicators across that we're able to look at our objectives across the marketing organization and clearly tie all the way from 3 to 5 year plans down to initial, you know, end activation that's happening within our markets.

00:38:05:51 - 00:38:34:21

And just to kind of close out, we were very excited last year to be named Creative Brand of the Year at Cannes. And our CMO, Manolo shared there that really we believe in creativity, that it's a superpower for growth and that inspires people and brings change to the world. And we're very excited that we're actually bringing that change, that creativity, that superpower to life through work front.

00:38:34:26 - 00:38:40:58
不明
So with that, we're happy to take any questions that you might have.

00:38:41:03 - 00:38:41:14

So.
