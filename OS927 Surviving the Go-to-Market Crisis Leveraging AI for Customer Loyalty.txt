One at the Adobe Summit. This is Gonzalo Winter, and thanks so much for joining me for this talk, where I'm going to be talking about how to survive the go to market crisis that all the marketing organizations and revenue organizations in the world are going through by leveraging AI to drive a better retention rates and build customer loyalty.

00:00:19:01 - 00:00:42:10
不明
So I hope you're all enjoying the summit so far. And thanks so much for joining me. I'm a strategic account executive at Cantera. Kaltura is a video technology company powering building experiences all around the world for some of the largest enterprises around the globe. And in my role, I lead, some of the relationships with our, fortune 500 customers, particularly in the tech space.

00:00:42:21 - 00:01:05:05
不明
So I'm working side by side with, CMS in building their content strategy, but also helping them drive better results using video as a medium. So very glad to have you here, and I hope you enjoy this talk. And, hopefully you'll find valuable stock to implement within your team and organization. So, just let's get started a little bit with describing what does Cultura do.

00:01:05:05 - 00:01:24:54
不明
And in a nutshell here you can see across multiple different use cases. How are we playing our cards in the video space? So, we're a company that is powering video experiences, whether it's live, real time and on demand across modes, all different use cases. As you can see on the on the top side of the screen.

00:01:24:59 - 00:01:50:58
不明
We're working with marketing organizations driving their webinar programs through our events platform that also allows them to stream, real time or live their digital events. We're also working with, developing community apps. And this community helps are basically video portals that allow you to, have a lot of your video on demand content for your viewers, different audiences to be able to watch at their own pace.

00:01:51:03 - 00:02:23:14
不明
We're also working on on developing a lot of AI tools for making, content creation and content production much more easier and seamless with our Content Lab experience that allows you to create chapters and summaries and quizzes and different highlight clips. In, in just one click. Also, we work with our corporate site teams to develop BD experiences that are spread across, your account, basically allowing you to drive, more engaging video experiences for your website visitors.

00:02:23:29 - 00:02:49:02
不明
And finally, we're also, into the audio space by having our podcast player that allows you to, drive that content and turn it into a podcast experience. As you can see, some of the largest tech companies in the world, trust in kaltura such as Salesforce, Adobe, Bloomberg, AWS, and also, other companies in different sectors such as education and finance and so on and so forth.

00:02:49:13 - 00:03:05:16
不明
So we were very lucky to work side by side with this amazing company that continue to push us to drive more value for their marketing strategies. So let's get started with the topic of the day. And as I was saying in the first line, and as we all know, and we've been talking about this for a while now, right?

00:03:05:16 - 00:03:33:08
不明
We are going through a crisis moment. And this is not like another depressing talk about all of the things that are making our jobs, harder, which it is kind of, you know, tough to be a marketer nowadays. But I'm really gonna be focusing on how do we see how do we foresee some of these challenges being solved, and what are some of the tools that we bring to market to our customers, and how we need to gather to really try to, go through these challenges and thrive?

00:03:33:17 - 00:04:05:04
不明
So some of the crisis, is driven by, by the points that we have here on screen, such as, you know, customer acquisition costs are rising. And this is mainly due to the fact that, there's much more content out there which is making people's attention. Less, or tougher to grasp. And that, of course, is creating for marketers a big challenge to really, make sure that people are watching our ads or our interacting with our content.

00:04:05:16 - 00:04:31:03
不明
And that creates, really, obstacles in the conversion funnel that drives our customer acquisition costs up. And that really drives our attention to retention and loyalty. How can we make sure that our existing customers are spending more with us, not just time, but also money? And that's probably more, a much better way to build your revenue, than trying to acquire new customers in this new scenario.

00:04:31:08 - 00:04:57:01
不明
The market, of course, as we all know, is increasingly volatile with, ongoing challenges going in the world. And that creates, more difficult, scenarios for marketers to build and implement their strategies. And that's how, we got to this point where we're all thinking about nurturing and retaining our customers because it's much less expensive to retain our customers than to try to, acquire new ones.

00:04:57:01 - 00:05:21:35
不明
So under this scenario is that marketers so they have to operate. And we're going to be discussing today how to navigate all of these challenges. So one of the things that I've seen, and I discuss with, some of the most important to see them also in the world is how can we better identify intent. And I think, we've discussed in the past in the, you know, marketing arena, but I don't think we've discussed it enough.

00:05:21:44 - 00:05:49:22
不明
And of course, in especially in the B2B space, it's one of the most important metrics or things that we should be considering once we are, designing our strategies and we are trying to target and, and, acquire customers or also retain our existing customers. Why is it intent important? Because it gives us the most important hints about which is this person at this in this team and this company is in the right time for us to target them with a specific message, right?

00:05:49:33 - 00:06:14:05
不明
So being able to identify that specific moment is going to be key to ensure or to maximize our chances of being successful once we reach to them with our, message. So how to measure intent right. Because we all talk about it. We will talk about like making data driven decisions. But in reality, not all not all the marketing organizations are actually leveraging data to, launch their marketing campaigns.

00:06:14:11 - 00:06:44:04
不明
So there's two ways where we see, data playing into identifying the right moment in time to reach out to your potential customers or to your actual customers to ensure that your retention flywheel is working in the best way possible. And those are zero party data. And first party data. And what I mean by this is how are we tracking this, data types to make sure that we know are which points in the funnel or which points in our prospect journey should we reach out to them.

00:06:44:18 - 00:07:22:49
不明
And zero party data and first party data differ in one central piece, which is that zero party, zero party data is data that our prospect or our visits or, you know, our website is, offering to us voluntarily. So they want to give us a certain piece of information or a certain preference, voluntarily. And that comes in the way of polls or service or quizzes or registrations and that makes us have to think how we can promote more of these types of interactions that allow our, prospects of our audience to want to provide to us this type of information about themselves and about their preferences.

00:07:22:49 - 00:07:57:01
不明
So collecting zero party data is key to identifying that specific intent that will tell us this specific person might be interested in this or that solution or product. First party data exchange is just what we are getting from our customers based on directly. So it's not something that they are, telling us is something that we're just tracking based on their activity, maybe on our website, on maybe if we're talking about on the digital experiences, arena, if they are, you know, watching where webinar or for how long they're watching our webinar or if how, how many times they come back to our landing page.

00:07:57:08 - 00:08:17:52
不明
That's the type of first party data that we want to track, because that will help us understand when we can trigger a specific message, because now we know what stage in the funnel they are, and we really want to target them really early in their product. Discovery journey. So once we identify that intent, that specific moment, what should we do?

00:08:17:52 - 00:08:34:40
不明
So we again gather in studio party data or gather in first party data. But now what? So first of all, we need to make sure that we have a system that in place that is collecting all of that data that's feeding into the marketing strategy. But then the second piece is like a skill as important is what is the message that we're putting out there.

00:08:34:53 - 00:08:57:04
不明
And the way that I like to think about this is basically ask yourself one question why will they care if you can think about a good reason why your visitor into your website, or why the person who registered to your webinar, or why whatever audience you, categorized your segment in social media would care about your message, then you're in trouble.

00:08:57:08 - 00:09:18:52
不明
So make sure that the message that you're putting out there follows like a proper content strategy. And that's the way that you bring together these two pieces, the data portion of it, like knowing that intent, when is the right time to reach out, and the content attribute, I think with what message. Right. So getting that right is basically the perfect balance and the sweet spot for marketers nowadays.

00:09:19:04 - 00:09:48:23
不明
If we want to bring those, customer acquisition costs down, but also if you want to make better messaging in the right time to our existing customers and retain them in, in a better way. So, so providing personalized experience, it's basically the basis and the foundation for, this balance that we were just talking about. So, for example, if we're talking about someone who attended a webinar but didn't engage that much during the session, maybe we should send a recap due in the form of an email, for example.

00:09:48:23 - 00:10:09:59
不明
We just like a short snippet of that webinar and have them interact and create more touchpoints for them to, provide their, their preferences or for us to gather information that then we can use. And infusing to our strategy. If someone downloaded a white paper, for example, what does that tell us? And at what moment in in their journey they did allowed they downloaded the white paper.

00:10:10:10 - 00:10:37:35
不明
And how we can use that information to create a more personalized message as a follow up. And something important that we're going to discuss today, of course, is how AI helps you in this overall strategy. Right? Then you have the message, you have the data, you have the information, but then you have a certain number of hours and of people to actually build content for, feeding data, that, that engine that you're putting out there to feed to your, your marketing strategy.

00:10:37:35 - 00:11:03:05
不明
Right. So I hope you build a scanner to put out as many messages as possible in the right timing, all in a seamless way, making, you save money, save time, and save precious resources that you can then, dedicate to, other types of tasks. So repurposing is something that we do very well at Cultura. For us, we're always talking about how you can make maximize the value that you get our from existing content.

00:11:03:05 - 00:11:37:38
不明
So let's say you created a webinar or you created an event and then what the event finishes or when the webinar ends. Now what? Now you want to maximize the value that you get out from that digital experience that you've already invested time and effort in producing. Right? So how you can recreate that webinar into other pieces of content that then you can use for social media or for different follow ups or for email marketing that will continue driving more and more engagement and more interaction, that will make sure that you're getting the most value out of that piece of content, and that will create more touchpoints for your audience to interact with, which will

00:11:37:38 - 00:11:58:19
不明
transform into more data that then you can use to continue enhancing, your overall strategy. As you can see here on the QR code, you can go and find out how being were managed to use our repurposing tools to really save time and money by creating, short clips from their events and repurpose that into their marketing strategy.

00:11:58:24 - 00:12:32:25
不明
So we're thinking about, video as a medium, as a key part of our retention strategy, because we're thinking about these engagements that will then you see here in screen where it's not just in the in the realm of digital experiences. It's not just, you launch a webinar, you've got the registration form, someone watches the webinar, and then you send the follow up, you know, we're talking about an entire journey where you're trying to create more and more touchpoints to be able to collect more data from your audience that then you can use in your marketing strategy for different types of purposes.

00:12:32:25 - 00:13:04:29
不明
Right? So it all starts with your registration running by that. Then you start engaging immediately with different types of content, maybe with a video portal that already has content for your people to to watch before the event starts, and then you repurpose that content into different, pieces that you can use in multiple different channels. And how will you using all of that, during that journey to continue collecting more data, to learn more about your audience and also to drive that value from the content that you're already producing, you know, in a better way.

00:13:04:42 - 00:13:33:50
不明
So we're thinking about this overall content strategy. What would be the as a central piece. And you see, I need to actually build that scalability component, allowing your marketers to really, take it, take your experiences to a next level. So we talked about the challenges, right? And some of the things that are, driving these challenges, as we discussed in the beginning, is the amount of content that is, right, right now out there for us to engage with.

00:13:33:52 - 00:14:05:08
不明
Right. There's many stats about how many pieces of information we consumers or, digital browsers, encounter in, in online, for example, from different brand from different companies. And that's just like brings our attention span, very to, to very low levels. So to more content, less attention that we have to pay attention to the messages that are out there and that of course, can there's our ability to convert our, our prospects into potential customers down the funnel.

00:14:05:13 - 00:14:25:20
不明
So we have to think how we can navigate that content overload that our audience is going through by adding more touchpoints in a smarter way. And on the second side, we can also think about, how we can create a more engaging environment for our customers to interact with each other. And that's when the community aspect comes to it.

00:14:25:29 - 00:14:53:02
不明
We discuss a lot of community in the marketing space when it comes to B to C, I don't think we've talked out enough about how this plays into B2B. So I think that it would be good to, to discuss how we can build community that will, experiences to really how our customers interact with each other and build better, stronger connections that that we can use in our advantage, to drive better results within our overall marketing strategy.

00:14:53:07 - 00:15:29:20
不明
A couple of examples of this, on, on and we can discuss this in further detail is, for example, NetSuite. One of our customers is is doing 300 webinars barrier to drive customer acquisition. And they are constantly thinking and leveraging AI and using our tools to, really take their webinar program to the next level since they want to drive more registrations, more attendees, they want to drive also product adoption for those customers that are already there, but, are not fully using or leveraging their products, and they want to do it everything at a personalized level.

00:15:29:20 - 00:15:49:35
不明
So when you have this scale or small problem, how can you think about actually driving one on one, connections with your customers? And that's how we're working with them, very closely and with their or their marketing leadership to think about how they can continue polishing their webinar program to make it, more personalized experience for their viewers.

00:15:49:46 - 00:16:10:52
不明
And also to drive better results from a customer acquisition standpoint, but also from a product adoption when it comes to retaining their existing customers and getting the most out of them, around. We can also discuss the story from Nike, how they created digital hubs to build interactive communities, how this drives better, better levels of loyalty and customer retention.

00:16:10:56 - 00:16:38:47
不明
These particular I did this on on their, on their mobile apps, with their fitness communities and I think they've done an amazing job. So if you want to really learn and get inspired of how you can think about building communities, around your product and around your service, I highly recommend checking out, checking out Nike's example, another very nice example of a company that worked with us to really, really drive that engagement up across their digital experiences is, Salesforce.

00:16:38:54 - 00:17:21:08
不明
So Salesforce streams, their flagship events through Salesforce plus their streaming platform. And those live streams are powered by Cantera. So this is a really, really, really amazing, work that we've done, working closely with their video production team and with their marketing team and with our events team, that managed to drive engagement up by 536%, by using different types of interaction tools such as polls and quizzes, surveys and the chat and collaboration, and also having the transcript, there live for people to go look for specific moments in the talk in the in the speech of the, of the, of the session, which was, a really good example

00:17:21:08 - 00:17:45:05
不明
of how we brought together our video technology with their event capabilities to stream amazing experiences for people to watch, live online. And it's a really a nice way to think about how you can transform a Live Express into then body content that you can then repurpose and have people engaging with once the event is over, as well.

00:17:45:10 - 00:18:08:36
不明
So to summarize, everything that we've talked about and how we as marketers should be thinking about, retaining our customers and also trying to bring our customer acquisition costs a little bit down with the existing tools that we have. Of course, we're talking about the medium of video because that's our main area of expertise and how we can leverage AI in our marketing strategy to drive better results.

00:18:08:49 - 00:18:32:10
不明
We should be thinking about three immediate steps. The first one is tracking zero on quality for but first party intent data and is not just tracking, it's also creating those opportunities. So thinking about how can I create more opportunities for my audience to voluntarily share with me their preferences? So that's the zero party data, how we can track that and put that into action.

00:18:32:14 - 00:18:53:20
不明
And from the first party data, how are we putting, engagement tools out there? So the our digital experience is such a service and both for people to share with us. Their, their, their interest, but also, so we can track their activity while they are navigating our content and our and our experiences out there. So that's the first point.

00:18:53:34 - 00:19:12:39
不明
Track creating opportunities. I'm tracking zero first party data. The second important action item that you should be thinking about and discuss it with your boss and with your team is how we can use AI to personalize our content and to create content at scale. And that's very important. We're also talking about how we can use AI to track engagement in real time.

00:19:12:50 - 00:19:48:32
不明
But then from a production standpoint, how we can continue repurposing the content that we've already invested time and efforts on to gain share in other different channels and, and really maximize the value that we're getting from our content. And the third piece, and it's really also important, is how we can centralize all our and all our digital experience into one central hub that not only brings, all of the experience together, but also creates this type of community experience where people can interact with each other, and really nurture the loyalty.

00:19:48:37 - 00:20:17:11
不明
Aspect of having people come together to watch, an experience together, but also, like, share their thoughts and their interests and, and continue building that community as you move forward, dumbed down your digital experiences strategy. So this is it for today. I think, another important aspect that I want to mention before I close out is AI is not a, a magic wand that you can just use and it will fix all your problems, but it is definitely going to help you.

00:20:17:16 - 00:20:33:25
不明
So you think about all of these things and as you navigate all of these challenges. So you should really think about how you can leverage this. And I've to the, we're at the forefront of how AI is being used in the, in the media ecosystem. So we will be more than happy to explore it together with you.

00:20:33:30 - 00:20:47:24
不明
So thanks so much for joining me today. I hope you have an amazing rest of the summit and thank you, Adobe for having us. It's been a wonderful day, Spencer. Wishing you all the best and hope to stay in touch.

00:20:47:29 - 00:20:47:50
不明
With.
