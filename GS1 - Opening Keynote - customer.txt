I'm delighted to welcome a leader who has redefined innovation, sustainability and global impact at one of the world's most iconic brands. As chairman and CEO of the Coca-Cola company, James Quincey has driven transformation, expanding beyond classic beverages to meet the demands of a changing world. And with a career spanning multiple continents and cultures, he brings a global perspective on leadership, innovation, and reinvention.

00:00:41:27 - 00:00:49:19
不明
Please join me in welcoming James Quincey.

00:00:49:24 - 00:01:15:29
不明
So while I pour myself a drink as well, James on rumor has it that at your first employee meeting as CEO of Coke, you neither wore a suit for the first time and you had a beverage from the Coca-Cola company. But that was not Coke. True? True. What message were you trying to send? I was trying to send two messages.

00:01:15:34 - 00:01:43:50
不明
One was we needed to move with the times. We were in the South. We were a very formal, hierarchical, stuck in our ways type culture at the time, and we needed to break out of it and saw the message. And actually, if you look at the when I was announced and all the fancy shows like this that we did and the investor stuff and blah, blah, blah, if you'd ask people the next week, what's the one thing they could remember?

00:01:43:55 - 00:02:05:25
不明
And the answer was he wore jeans and it wasn't Friday. I know that's weird for all you tech people, but like, that was a big deal ten years ago at the company. And I got a lot of hate mail, from local tailors whose business was the top people in suits and all sorts of things. But the the message was very clear about the culture had to change.

00:02:05:25 - 00:02:25:26
不明
And the second thing was about the products we had got ourselves trapped strategically in the idea. We wanted to be a total beverage company, but everything we looked at, people said, but it has to be Coke first, and you have to love Coke the most, but you can't have a total you can't have all these different apps. If one has to be loved more than the others.

00:02:25:31 - 00:02:44:45
不明
You need to be able to choose. You need to be able to choose Topo Chico and I need to be able to choose Coke. And if if you don't allow that, you trap everyone in, a brand strategy that doesn't let the people choose. You're trying to sell what you make rather than make what sells. And so the two things had to, had to be broken down.

00:02:44:46 - 00:03:13:50
不明
And the reason I did it by what I wore and by what I drunk is a very, famous old CMO of Coke once said, everything communicates and largely it's not what's on the PowerPoint. It's not what's on the screen with all the fancy technology. It's not what the CEO actually says is what he does. And the thing they can remember is I was wearing jeans and I wasn't drinking a Coke on that day, and that was a very powerful communication for them.

00:03:13:55 - 00:03:34:08
不明
That's great. We'll go back a little bit. I mean, one thing we both have in common is we were actually aspiring electronics engineers so we could spend hours living. Yeah, we could spend our time talking about transmission lines and capacitors and inductors, but I don't think people are here for that. But just a little bit about your personal journey.

00:03:34:08 - 00:04:00:45
不明
I mean, I know you were in consulting for many years. You joined Coke in 96, and then you actually had a significant amount of global positions that you had and drove growth in Latin America, Mexico, Asia, just maybe a little bit about the leadership lessons, and especially the global ones. I think the the first thing I would say is there wasn't a grand plan.

00:04:00:50 - 00:04:23:04
不明
So for all of you out there who haven't had, you know, a 20 year career plan written out for the last 19 years, I didn't either. I'm not saying that's necessarily the best advice for everyone to just go with the flow. But I had joined companies, whether it was in consulting or a colleague that was very interested in growing the the people in their capabilities.

00:04:23:04 - 00:04:40:35
不明
And so the opportunities came along. So I didn't have to have a weird career plan. I just went and did things that were interesting. So I always say, as one of my bits of advice is do something that real, really interested in, because the chances of you getting out of bed in the morning and giving your best are much higher.

00:04:40:35 - 00:05:06:27
不明
If you like what you're doing than if you don't like what you're doing. So like what you're doing. The second thing that I would say is, particularly as it relates to Coke and Adobe's absolutely the same, it growth is what drives the machine forward. And so in each of those general management jobs, there came a time where something bold needed to be done, some reinvention was needed.

00:05:06:32 - 00:05:29:14
不明
And so having the courage to make the bold decision and go all in on something, I mean, you, you change the way Adobe was connected to creativity and marketing. Every one of those jobs had a moment when there was a super big decision that was needed, and being courageous enough to do it is relatively rare in general management.

00:05:29:25 - 00:05:51:47
不明
Lots of other people, there's lots of process and blah blah blah, and it goes on forever. But actually, I know this is the moment for the big decision. It always came at some point. Well, you talked about reinvention and Coke. Certainly. I think a lot of people here may not even know that while Coke was known for the first 100 years, you've really transformed it to this total beverage company.

00:05:51:52 - 00:06:16:53
不明
As I read it, 200 brands, and 30 of which are more than $1 billion of business. So you know, for everybody in this audience, how do you think about innovation? I saw, presentation of yours where you called yourself the chief agitator for innovation. So maybe, you know, touch on that. James. Yeah, it's a I mean, innovation firstly comes in many different shapes and sizes for us.

00:06:16:58 - 00:06:38:18
不明
It can be a niche thing. We're just putting something out there to get attention and bring people back to the core franchise. So putting out a a Coke, an Oreo flavor, it's never going to last forever. But it brings attention back to Coke, the main brand. So innovation has multiple roles. About whether it's you're trying to create a new thing permanently or whether you're trying to bring people back to an existing franchise.

00:06:38:18 - 00:07:00:37
不明
You can be about the packaging, it can be about the marketing, about the way we do the marketing. But when it when we're talking about the core product, it's it's really about trying to serve unmet needs and expand the universe as the industry has grown. You started with like a cola, you started with a cola, and then you got eventually, after decades and decades and decades, people said, well, what about a calorie free one?

00:07:00:37 - 00:07:25:40
不明
And then someone said, well, what about a cafe? So they're always looking for the feelings around the big ideas. The problem of Coke is we have more ideas that are ever going to work. And so whilst I have one role, which is chief agitator, to do something, whether it's continue to make the core brands relevant for the next ten years, as they have been for the last hundred and 40 years, or do something new.

00:07:25:51 - 00:07:48:53
不明
I'm also and the PR people have tried to stop me in the old days from saying it. I'm the chief zombie killer because whilst whilst we have 200 brands now, five years ago we had 400 and I and that's the brands. If you think they come in multiple package sizes, the number of brands, times, number of packages is in the thousands and every brand manager turns up.

00:07:48:54 - 00:08:07:46
不明
I don't know if it's the same at Adobe, and they see a product that's struggling and hasn't worked for the last three years, and they go, I can fix it. Just one more campaign. We can do it, or one more reprograming or of it will produce the content for you. Yeah, exactly. And then we've got lots of people who love your stuff and they keep produce.

00:08:07:56 - 00:08:26:31
不明
But no, it's like, no, the time has come, it needs to be put to bed. And so actually the 200 used to be 400. And again, we in in the middle of Covid we took the decision to kill half the brands. So I agitate but I'm also if it doesn't work it doesn't work. And it's got to go.

00:08:26:36 - 00:08:54:14
不明
We'll get into marketing because the entire audience hears about marketing. But before that, just one other thing that fascinated me about the Coca-Cola company is your ecosystem of partners. The bottling partners that you have. You have, 33 million customer outlets. And I think you've talked about how people across the entire chain, should be profitable. So maybe just the business strategy around having this incredible ecosystem of partners.

00:08:54:14 - 00:09:26:24
不明
So let me describe it and then say, why was we, the Coke company, focus on the brands, the marketing, the innovation, the strategy and the orchestration. We then have several hundred, what we call bottling partners. They physically receive a concentrate, the secret concentrate from us. They then get water, fees, sugar, other ingredients, and they physically put them in bottles, put them on the trucks and take them to the 33 million physical outlets around the world that we deliver to each week.

00:09:26:29 - 00:09:50:06
不明
And we're selling approximately 2.2 billion eight ounce servings of our products every single day. So today, they'll be 2.2 billion of our products consumed. So it's a massive physical system, and that's just us. And the bottle is then you get the the metal and everything else. We it works for us because we cannot be good at everything we had.

00:09:50:11 - 00:10:17:23
不明
When I started, we owned 40% of the bottling system and we were at best mediocre at being bottlers. And it at times we were on a train to be mediocre on other things too, and we had to be true to ourselves. And we're really good at one set of things, and we can find a lower set of people who are really good at bottling, which is a very different it's much more asset heavy.

00:10:17:23 - 00:10:40:26
不明
It's much more it's the margins are less, it's much more people. So the 750,000 people who work in the coke system, us and the bottlers, on which less than 50,000 are in the Coke Company. And I'm including some of the bottling companies we still own. The vast majority of the people and assets are here, and they're great at running those things, and we're great at running a marketing mission.

00:10:40:26 - 00:11:05:02
不明
When the franchise system works, it's unbeatable because you have both the global perspective and scale of the company and its brands. And yet each bottler is local to the place they're in. There are 60 plus bottlers in the US. There are multiple bottlers in Mexico. They're all different, and they love the bit of the world they're in. They own that dirt and go to market every day for that dirt.

00:11:05:02 - 00:11:25:47
不明
And we don't forget about any corner of the world. So let's talk about building brands then. And you know, when you talk about global versus local, 2.2 billion, you know, ounces, eight ounces sold every day. I mean, how do you decide how do you build brands globally versus what's local? Yeah, I'm that's an eternal, struggle.

00:11:25:54 - 00:11:50:36
不明
And as the starting point is, we need to make the brands relevant for each group of consumers. So the the relevance of the brand is the key. And what that generally turns into, it's a set of decisions. We're going to prioritize brands that count. Products that can be global. So I'm not looking to acquire, a portfolio of zillions of things that are just relevant to one city at a time.

00:11:50:36 - 00:12:12:46
不明
I would prioritize things that can be relevant around the world, but if you take something like brand Coca-Cola, the focus of the marketing is the core idea is there's some things that are true about humanity across the world optimism, happiness. The idea of a better world. There's no way that that's not true. And it's linked to the Coca-Cola brand.

00:12:12:51 - 00:12:37:50
不明
But how that's brought to life in each country has to be profoundly local. So we have both global programs and global a framework or a corridor in which Coca-Cola and all the other brands must operate. But then it's brought to life differently in every country in, in, in India is with beer and in other places with with tacos in Mexico, with burgers in the U.S., it is profoundly brought to life.

00:12:37:51 - 00:12:57:48
不明
If it's Coke and meals, is the idea of sharing a Coke at a meal is a universal idea, but the meal and the location of the meal, and whether it's a couple of people or the whole family, is a very local food, is much more local than beverages. If you break the industries down, food is profoundly local versus beverages.

00:12:57:53 - 00:13:17:59
不明
And so what that looks like in every country is different. You touched on Share a Coke, and one of the things that I was really amazed with is how you've actually engaged by having customers in your marketing for decades, and you know the story around how you started to share a Coke with, you know, the intention of everybody being allowed to have their name on a brand.

00:13:17:59 - 00:13:47:40
不明
I mean, that was pioneered well before social marketing or social media, maybe. How do you think about integrating customers in your campaigns and, you know, the pros and cons of that? Yeah. So I mean firstly on Share a Coke, it was it was really one of the first pieces of digital marketing at scale. The reason it never happened before is because the idea of personalization never existed.

00:13:47:45 - 00:14:05:45
不明
It just was not practical at scale. I mean, in your intro you have created and you have scale for me, I can find plenty of creative people with lots of ideas. That is, customers are my folks back is how will it ever be big? And so I think digital marketing, you could always print your own label and stick it on the can.

00:14:05:50 - 00:14:24:14
不明
But when I make 2.2 billion a day, for those of you interested in the technology of how you make a label on the bottle, the label on the bottle comes in a mega reel. Like like I'm not not exactly a huge reel of labels. It is tens of thousands on a reel. But to print that reel, it's like printing a newspaper.

00:14:24:19 - 00:14:50:09
不明
You just in the old days when it was analog, they all had to be the same. And so every bottle had to be the same. But with digital printing, the digital printer can print a different name on every label. On the reels, you can have thousands of different names. And so suddenly it was one of the first times that the digitization of the execution of marketing to produce a much more personalized experience is like probably like almost 20 years ago now.

00:14:50:14 - 00:15:21:26
不明
And that was the beginning of actually being able to do personalization at physical scale. You could do it in emails, but face physical personalization. Now you can go to the Las Vegas Coke store here and in 30s. They'll like whatever you want. Beautiful high tech printing. And so that kind of personalization of scale really well when you want to then engage with with customers, actually we you could customize the people, the end consumer, we call them consumers.

00:15:21:26 - 00:15:44:43
不明
It gets very confusing customers of the retailers for us. But the end consumer is really wants to be the center of their own story and narrative mean. That's part of what all this personalized creativity about is engaging them in their own narrative. Now, we could enter into debate as to how social media is putting people at the center of their own universes, and the pros and cons of that and where it's leading us.

00:15:44:54 - 00:16:19:18
不明
Yeah, but that is part of what's going on, is they want to be the center of their all protagonist in their own story. And so this digitization, not just of the virtual world, but the physical world can make them the protagonist in their own story, which is profoundly attractive. You know, more recently, I think, during the holiday season, you actually push the envelope with using AI in some of these campaigns and a lot of people may not know you actually started that work well before, you know, I sort of became mainstream, maybe just, you know, the role of technology and AI in marketing.

00:16:19:18 - 00:16:45:35
不明
And, you know, as you thought about that campaign, what were you trying to, you know, focus on. Yeah, we made it. I mean, we've always been in AI in the kind of the process and the analytical side. And obviously, as a massive marketer, you as we've been able to personalize communication, whether it be emails, people, a personalized, voice communication or text or whatever, the opportunity to go to gen AI.

00:16:45:35 - 00:17:03:31
不明
The breakthrough in January, we had no idea how to use where we jumped on the train because we said, look, that's the way the world's going. Let's at least get on and let's understand, because we're big and that tends to make us slow. If we're not in at the beginning for us to get to scale, we often end up tonight.

00:17:03:31 - 00:17:21:50
不明
And so we started with the gen AI on the pictures, and actually one of the first scale usage of Gen I own pictures. We print a lot of point of sale material. Those 33 million outlets, we go to most of the mom and pop stores in the emerging world. And there's a picture of a Coke, someone drinking it with an with an ad.

00:17:21:55 - 00:17:40:15
不明
In the old days, there was a photographer and, and a specialist somewhere, like putting all that together. Now there's a gen AI program that can have a picture of me and you having a pizza or a car, sharing the drinks you want to drink. And if they want to change the drink, you've got to make out. They just press the button on the unit and they can print it and send it to the.

00:17:40:15 - 00:18:01:51
不明
So. So this revolutionary static imagery has occurred, just making a huge change. The way marketing happens physically printed. The next stage was okay, when's video coming? And that has come now, the ad we made for Christmas, for those you can't see you then you can look it up on the internet. It's a nice, you know, Christmas ad with the polar bears on the truck.

00:18:02:01 - 00:18:34:49
不明
What's interesting about is, is a few things. One, it was cheaper to make than historical regular ads. It was much quicker to make. So it was a huge productivity opportunity. The limitations. What couldn't it do? It cannot. It cannot produce resolution on people's faces that humans will buy into. So the boundary is still inanimate or kind of animal scale resolution of the picture.

00:18:34:54 - 00:18:59:07
不明
We generally want to make ads with people in. So it's, it's it's super interesting because you can make a video with music and voice and you can customize it endlessly, and we can we can talk about where customization could take us. So it's super exciting, but it is not yet at this stage when it can make all our ads because we want people in them.

00:18:59:07 - 00:19:21:03
不明
And humans are incredibly effective at no to sing AI. That's not actually a human. It will get there. I don't know how long it's going to take us, but when it breaks through and marry that idea with what is the ultimate unit cost of making that, and I think is going to be a huge wave of marketing revolution and creativity.

00:19:21:08 - 00:19:49:15
不明
So maybe just you know, looking around the corner and if you had a wish list of how you would like creativity and AI to help you transform how you market to consumers. What do you see around the corner? I as someone once said to me, you can't see over the horizon. I think there's a going to be, a struggle between two ends of the spectrum.

00:19:49:20 - 00:20:10:58
不明
One is as the technology develops and as especially as humans can be resolved into the Jenny generation programs. The question will become, in part, what is the cost of every time I make it? Because let me give you the kind of the the kind of the, the futuristic one end of the spectrum, which is the cheaper it gets to make.

00:20:10:58 - 00:20:36:23
不明
Gen I, the easier it is for me to put you in the at on your phone and put someone else in the ad on their phone, because I just pick up your picture and drop it in the ad. So I make you the protagonist of the ad. If that's cheap to do, great. I put you in the next stage is to say, well, you looked at your phone, but you didn't buy the product, and I know you didn't buy it.

00:20:36:28 - 00:20:54:15
不明
So today what happens is it goes back to a bunch of humans and they match their teeth and they go, well, okay, what can we do to make sure no click yes. In the future? The AI can do that. It can go well, okay, he didn't click. Yes, but let me. If it's cheap to redo the ad, I'll just make a few changes in the ad.

00:20:54:15 - 00:21:23:59
不明
Like a AB test and redo the ad and then re show it to Shantanu and see if he clicks and I'll keep changing it until it clicks. Yes. And so the lower the cost of the ad, the more I can set up an I plus some sort of intelligent engine to chase you until you click yes. At the other end of the spectrum will be the whole load of annoyed consumers.

00:21:24:04 - 00:21:46:04
不明
And they will start going, man, this is this is like gone from Minority report to something really weird. Now, I mean, it, I want to buy those apps that block everything. And so I block everything. And where does Coke then spend his money? Maybe I have to spend it on live experiences, because the only thing you can't avoid is a live experience.

00:21:46:14 - 00:22:15:35
不明
Look at how live experiences are growing. Look how the music industry is trending. All the money is in the live experiences. So this interplay between creativity, the cost of the creativity, people's level of annoyance, between being flooded and live experiences in the center will be the quality of the creativity I'm willing to let in the best stuff. I don't want to be spammed with rubbish.

00:22:15:40 - 00:22:42:07
不明
Yeah, and that interplay between these three different polls, I think we to put a premium on core creativity. Maybe. Last question. As you sit at the, you know, center of one of these largest companies with an iconic brand, we all think about purpose and we all think about responsibility. So maybe just a little bit about, you know, as CEO of Coke, how do you think about advancing purpose for companies?

00:22:42:11 - 00:23:03:41
不明
Yeah. Well, firstly you got to understand what it is. And, and I think, you know, we have reflected on purpose over the years and come back to the very essence of where we started, which was to refresh the world and make a difference. It's all about the business we're in. Refresh the world. We're a beverage business, but not in any other businesses.

00:23:03:46 - 00:23:24:19
不明
People say, should you do the x, y and go, like, if we're good at beverages, what's the chances of us being good at the next thing much lower. So let's just keep investing in beverages, especially as the opportunity is still massive. And make a difference is in the in the inside. And you mentioned one of the ideas which was everyone who touches the Coke business needs to make money.

00:23:24:24 - 00:23:57:25
不明
It's not set up so that we try and capture everything. We want everyone to be excited about working with Coke and they need to make money to do so, because in the end, that cannot be a sustainable, successful business if the ecosystem and the society exists and is not also sustainable and successful. And that then feeds into how we approach, the economics, everyone needs to make some money, how we approach things like water or waste packaging, like we have an objective to return all the water we use.

00:23:57:29 - 00:24:17:55
不明
Because if there's a problem with the water aquifer in the world, not necessarily the first, but pretty close to the first person to be blamed will be us, irrespective of how much water we use. And so we're very focused on making sure that every element of the business, from the economics to the side effects, are all taken into consideration.

00:24:17:55 - 00:24:45:05
不明
And we can say we have for a set of policies that allow the business to be sustainable and grow in the very long term. Let's end with a quick word association. You know, I'll just give you a word, whatever word comes to mind as a result of that. Birmingham getting better, not Alabama. It means England. Aston Villa, our time has come.

00:24:45:10 - 00:24:49:10
不明
Champions League said last.

00:24:49:14 - 00:25:10:55
不明
Consumer center Olympics gold ice hotel, etc.. Awesome experience that got to be done. The Coca-Cola company iconic James Quincey, forgettable.

00:25:10:59 - 00:25:20:27
不明
Please join me in thanking, James Quincey Sylvania. Thank you.

00:25:20:32 - 00:25:42:02
不明
Wow, what an inspiring video. I'm thrilled to introduce Jennifer. Alex. New Jennifer is group vice president and chief customer officer at Eli Lilly and Company. She's been in senior executive roles for over 20 years now at Eli Lilly, and they're doing some amazing work at the intersection of medicine and digital. We'll talk about content, too, but we really deeply appreciate you being here.

00:25:42:02 - 00:26:07:34
不明
Jen, thank you for joining us. Thank you for having me. Thank you. So, you know, we've talked about Eli Lilly in the past, especially how you've been using generative AI to speed up the process of discovering new medicines. The kinds of things that we just saw in the video would be great if you could just start by just telling us a little bit about Lilly's mission, that, you know, over the last hundred and 50 years and share about your current role and also what's changed for Lilly in the last few years.

00:26:07:34 - 00:26:35:31
不明
Sure. Thank you. I know, and I'm so glad that you started off with mission. What a great place for us to get started, because if you look at Adobe's mission, you're changing the world through digital, personalized experiences. At Lilly, we're changing the world by creating innovative medicine that makes life better for people everywhere. And believe it or not, we've been doing it for almost 150 years.

00:26:35:35 - 00:27:15:25
不明
In that time, we've had the chance to really take on some of the toughest diseases, improving the course of human health. We were the first to deliver life saving insulin for diabetes patients. The Salk vaccine to eradicate polio. Fluoxetine in order to revolutionize depression, then Christine, to fight cancer and vancomycin, which today is still the last line of defense against antibiotic resistant infections, nearly 75 years after it was invented.

00:27:15:29 - 00:27:53:21
不明
And our story today hasn't changed. We are still laser focused on innovation. We're working hard to discover, to develop and manufacture high quality medicines to meet the toughest medical needs. And we're doing it across immunology, oncology, neuroscience and cardio metabolic health, all with the goal of improving the course of human health. As you've said, I have had the wonderful privilege of being on this journey at Lilly for over 20 years and now serving as the Global Chief Customer officer.

00:27:53:26 - 00:28:15:20
不明
I get the wonderful response ability to be able to take this lifesaving innovation and deliver it through personalized and end experiences. That's a really inspiring story that I hope 150 years you think you talk about me. You guys have run after the biggest challenges in health in the last 150 years, and you've tackled a number of them, like the polio vaccine.

00:28:15:20 - 00:28:36:23
不明
I didn't know about that one. That was it's amazing. So what are some of the challenges that you're currently seeing? Where are you? Where do you see the forefront? You outlined the four big areas. Where do you see some of the current challenges? Yeah, sure. You know, as we kind of think about what we're doing at Will, they were trying to create this world where everybody can live their healthiest life possible.

00:28:36:27 - 00:29:03:31
不明
So to be able to do that, you have to focus on what matters most. That's our customers. It's our patients. And, you know, to really go after that, you've got to take on and tackle the biggest challenges that are disrupting their overall customer experience. So there's four major areas that we're working on today. You know, the first one is we have to continue to improve the access and affordability of our drugs.

00:29:03:44 - 00:29:35:14
不明
We have to reduce patient burden, and we have to improve equity in the healthcare system, a system that doesn't make it easier for people to get on medicine and to stay on that medicine. Second, we are committed to the safe and reliable use of our medications. That means setting a new bar with patients safety, and it means educating people on the dangers posed by the proliferation of counterfeit, fake, or untested knockoffs.

00:29:35:19 - 00:30:04:15
不明
Third, we're really fighting against the stigma that our patients feel when they're living with these conditions. So, for example, we know that, folks living with obesity, they actually receive negative bias or stigma when they're interacting with people in public or sometimes even in a doctor's office. And we also know that those feelings prevent them from seeking and getting the care that they deserve.

00:30:04:20 - 00:30:23:15
不明
And finally, the one you and I are working on together, we have to have a more personalized approach to be able to meet our patients and our health care providers in the where exactly they are today, with the right content at the time that they need us most. Exactly. And I would love to talk a little bit more about that.

00:30:23:15 - 00:30:42:58
不明
But just, you know, in the course of, you know, 150 years is a huge cultural track record at the company. If you look at change management and how you are working on Lilly, just would love to understand how you adapted your approach in recent years to overcome some of these challenges and what you are currently doing from a customer needs and a customer experience perspective?

00:30:42:59 - 00:31:19:26
不明
Yeah, definitely. You know, in order to continue to live out our mission of making life better for people around the world, we've really had to evolve our overall approach. And in fact, looking in the audience and we've learned so much from so many of you, Coca-Cola, Nvidia, Unilever, Procter Gamble, Microsoft, and of course, Adobe that, you know, to truly improve the connection that we have with our customers, we have to deliver compelling content, and we have to do it at that key cultural moments that matter most.

00:31:19:30 - 00:31:43:13
不明
We've also learned from all of you that we've got to change how we're thinking about our interactions. Instead of moving from a tactic by tactic basis, we really are going after holistic health and understanding the entire journey that a patient is on when they're suffering from a disease. In fact, some of you might have seen it in the video that we kicked off this conversation with.

00:31:43:18 - 00:32:04:35
不明
We're really trying to live out our brand truth of health. Above all, it's how you should see us when we show up to work. It's how we talk about what Lilly stands for. It shows up in the partnerships that we have, the sponsorships that we sign, and it also shows up in the solutions that we deliver directly to our customers.

00:32:04:39 - 00:32:31:04
不明
Maybe one example that we should share is Lilly Direct that was launched in 2024. Lilly Direct was actually the first to market direct to consumer health care platform that actually spanned the entire journey of our patients. So if you're a patient logged on to Lilly Direct, you had the opportunity to access more information about the condition you were suffering from.

00:32:31:09 - 00:32:52:20
不明
You also had a chance to be able to maybe find a doctor that was close to your home or you could do a telehealth visit if you were prescribed a Lilly treatment, we could ship that medicine directly to your house. And of course, we had support services that were helping you stay adherent to the treatment plan that your doctor prescribed.

00:32:52:25 - 00:33:27:28
不明
Now, those support services also had an opportunity for people to access content to make better, healthier lifestyle changes. It could be related to diet, exercise, stress management, and even sleep because we believe that great innovation combined with good, healthy lifestyle choices delivered through personalized experiences is going to give the patients the outcomes that they deserve. Let's just maybe double clicking into that that holistic health that you talked about and the role the technology is playing.

00:33:27:33 - 00:33:46:33
不明
And and you guys have been pioneers in putting together the content supply chain, a very regulated market. Would love to hear a little bit more about that, the technology planning and then how you're digging into the course. Our partnership as well. You know, if we think about the healthcare industry right now, we have a movement to really transform.

00:33:46:38 - 00:34:10:49
不明
There is a new consumer base that is like hungry to take control of their personal health journey. But just like all the other decisions that they make in their day to day life, they're demanding simplicity. They expect personalization. They want that eye-catching content that separates from all the noise. And they're expecting value from us each and every single day.

00:34:10:54 - 00:34:33:30
不明
Now we know at Lilly that we are not going to be able to achieve this alone. It's one of the reasons why I'm excited to be here today, and that we're really proud of the partnership that we have with Adobe, because with Adobe, we've been able to transform the content supply chain. We're working to be able to plan, manage and measure our customer interactions.

00:34:33:35 - 00:35:01:20
不明
And this isn't just a marketing thing. It's something we're working together to roll out around the entire globe in order to transform how we're interacting with customers. We believe that if we can revolutionize the content supply chain experience, we have an opportunity to get to those best in class type of experiences. And maybe, you know, I'll sure, I know you and I have had a lot of learnings along the way as we've been working on this.

00:35:01:25 - 00:35:26:34
不明
Maybe just share one with the audience. I would just share with all of you that it's not just about generative AI or one of the components on the stack, like experience manager, Journey Optimizer. It's really getting to that full customer orchestration that matters. And that is something I know we are really working on together, and I look forward to doing even more of that to come in.

00:35:26:40 - 00:35:43:43
不明
A lot of the innovations that we saw today, I've been inspired by the partnership and the feedback that we've had from you. Really terrific work that you and the Lilly team are doing. And so just maybe looking forward as you continue the mission, what's coming next? Sure. Well, I think you can tell are and I hope all of you will say the same.

00:35:43:48 - 00:36:19:23
不明
You know, we're really excited about the opportunities in front of us to truly improve and personalize the end to end customer experience, bringing innovation and healthy behaviors to people all over the world. Now, this is so important that we get this right, because at Lilly, we're just now embarking on our next era of innovation and really coming out with some breakthrough medicines that are going to be able to solve some of society's largest health challenges in diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer's.

00:36:19:23 - 00:36:48:48
不明
And we are just now figuring out the power of genetic medicine. But as I started this conversation, and as we've talked so many times before, it's more than just life changing innovation. It's taking that medicine healthy lifestyle choices, embedding it into our end to end personalized experiences and that is what's going to matter most to patients around the world.

00:36:48:52 - 00:37:12:43
不明
So, now and to you as well, is it really the entire Adobe team? I want to say thank you for the partnership that we have. We look forward to continuing to make life better for people around the world and make a true difference in humanity. Thank you, thank you. Huge round of applause for Tim. Thank you so much for phenomenal.

00:37:12:43 - 00:37:39:06
不明

You know, we have covered a lot of ground this morning all focused on supporting you in this new era of customer experience orchestration and to help you deliver personalize personalization at scale specific to the individual with the help of AI.

00:37:39:11 - 00:38:07:13
不明

00:38:07:18 - 00:38:31:25

They'll go deeper into the areas we have discussed with sessions focused on AI and the content supply chain, and featuring expert from our team as well as industry leaders.

00:38:31:30 - 00:38:57:53
不明
