00:00:00:01 - 00:00:23:37
不明
All right. Well thanks, everybody. You're ready to get started here. We're here to talk about maximizing your investments and making sure that, you know, we talk about this is about co-leading in IT and marketing and bridging that to help develop Center of Excellence. So I am, going to introduce ourselves and let Jenny go first. So I'm Jenny Huynh, I'm with Winnebago Industries.

00:00:23:38 - 00:01:03:04
不明
I've been there three and a half years, and I head up application development for Winnebago and have been the, transformation lead from an IT perspective. And I am Tina Jacobs, and I'm with Permittivity Digital. And we've been partnering with Winnebago on this journey. And my role is really focusing on helping make sure that businesses recognize the value of their investments, providing both advisory services and guiding technical implementation along the journey to really make sure we're holding true to the commitments that the technology is saying that it can do, and making sure we're building the the business forward in that, in that mission.

00:01:03:09 - 00:01:26:30
不明
So I'm going to introduce, a little video, give you guys a reprieve and enjoy, something that's in the works right now or we're about to launch next month, which is one of our brands, our collective brands. So sit back and just watch for a minute, and we'll, we'll go from here.

00:01:26:35 - 00:01:53:45
不明
We're investing in a future of a digital consumer experience. Our redesigned website removes friction, offering faster speed, stability, and consistency. Built with insights from owner and prospect research and the expertise of leading digital partners. Navigation is intuitive. Connecting customers with what they want faster.

00:01:53:50 - 00:02:14:38
不明
With immersive galleries and detailed specs. Shoppers get the full experience at their fingertips. Customizing a simple floor plans, options and details are just a click away center.

00:02:14:43 - 00:02:30:33
不明
Ready to build, price or connect? The journey from discovery to action is seamless, ensuring more qualified leads for you, our dealers.

00:02:30:38 - 00:02:47:59
不明
Continued access to artifacts and materials to create continuity between the online researcher and in dealership experience. Elevate the experience to drive results.

00:02:48:03 - 00:03:16:44
不明
Hope you enjoyed that. So this was really a representation of something that is the first phase of a multi-phase initiative for us. So it's it's a sizzle reel that's going to be, aligning to their market model year turnover at the dealer conferences next or next year, next week. Sorry. Next month. So we're going to talk about how this two year evolution in this journey together is really about bringing together the tech in the and the marketing.

00:03:16:44 - 00:03:41:15
不明
And, Newmar happens to be one of the brands within Winnebagos umbrella. And Jen is going to talk a little bit about that right now. Yeah. And so if I were to just, layer on a little bit more. So we've been working with productivity on this Newmar website, which if anybody likes to camp and has a couple million dollars laying around, I'd love to connect with you because the market's a little soft right now.

00:03:41:20 - 00:04:11:40
不明
I'm not in sales, but I'll do my darnedest. They are beautiful. But we've actually partnered with productivity on a few fronts. We've partnered on our digital asset management implementation. I'll tell you a little bit more about that later. As well as our Chris craft.com and our Winnebago Industries, corporate page as well. And just a lot of the foundational architecture that's necessary in order to, build from, you know, a shared set of assets that can be then leveraged and rolled out across the brands.

00:04:11:40 - 00:04:35:26
不明
And what you don't know about the Newmar site is we were able to take a lot of the assets, not all, obviously, but a lot of the assets that we created as we built, Winnebago Industries and Chris Craft. Pages. And then kind of I call it reskilling there. You know, of course, that's not Adobe's word, but basically throw a different front end to these templates that you build, and be able to more rapidly, launch your, your websites, your dams, your things like that.

00:04:35:26 - 00:04:55:38
不明
So, but, in terms of an agenda for today, we are going to talk about, you know, why you might want to think about, a, multi-brand center of excellence. And we'll talk a little bit about our experience there. We will talk about what our goals and objectives were in creating a center of excellence and, how we created and launched that center of excellence.

00:04:55:38 - 00:05:17:33
不明
And we'll talk about results and what we think. We'll give you a little peek into what we think is next. So Winnebago Industries, started with a small company in, Forest City, Iowa, Winnebago, which a lot of people have heard about. But what most people don't know was we've been on a journey over the last ten years to collect other brands.

00:05:17:33 - 00:05:44:28
不明
Iconic brands, in our portfolio. And so these brands are our trusted leaders in the outdoor recreation industry. There's some of the world's most iconic brands. If you think about Chris Kraft, 150 years old, proud of, that asset, and some of our, our brands are our baby is really in comparison, Barletta pontoons, which I own a pontoon at this point.

00:05:44:33 - 00:06:06:52
不明
If you ever want to work for Winnebago, there is a discount. So I, Barletta pontoons is only eight years old, and so we do have quite a span in terms of legacy. Newmar and, Winnebago both were formed in the 50s. And so, there's there's legacy technical debt there that we all have and don't like to talk about because it's not very fun, but we still have to have it.

00:06:06:57 - 00:06:28:09
不明
And then our newest acquisition is lithium batteries, which does, of course, suggest that we're going to move into adjacencies. And the reason they've done this is because there are soft markets like today. So we need to diversify our portfolio. We need to, you know, make sure that we have multiple sources of revenue streams and customer streams in order to be able to be viable.

00:06:28:13 - 00:06:52:05
不明
A little bit more about Winnebago. So you may not know that we're a North America based manufacturer. We have manufacturing in Minnesota, Iowa, Indiana and Florida. And we have about 7200 FTE is we have a couple thousand contractors on on top of that. We're pretty proud of, being, what we feel like is and is known for quality and innovation.

00:06:52:10 - 00:07:12:51
不明
And so some of the things that, you know, I selected from the many prestigious awards that we've, received are, I'm pretty proud of the fact that we have prototyped electric, boats and RVs. And specialty vehicles, and a specialty vehicle is food trucks or dental offices on wheels or, you know, busses and things like that.

00:07:12:51 - 00:07:51:32
不明
So we have rigs on the road that are using, electricity as their source rather than gas powered. We also partner, of course, with a lot of agencies like the Nature Conservatory and the National Parks Foundation, because we want to preserve the outdoors, for ourselves, you know, selfishly, but also for our customers. And, we also have invested in the last several years in inclusion, and we have several partnerships and a growing list of partnerships to make sure that, underrepresented communities are able to also take advantage of the wonderful assets that we have in the United States.

00:07:51:36 - 00:08:05:53
不明
In terms of our national parks and our lakes and rivers and you know, all of those kinds of things. So, and maybe the last thing, you know, for some of you, you might be thinking, okay, that's great, but then what do you do with a big boss when you know it's kind of at the end of life?

00:08:05:58 - 00:08:44:11
不明
We are exploring things like recycled materials. We do a lot of our own, building of components. So we do our own stitch craft, for example. We make cushions, we make cabinets, you know, we make, you know, water holding tanks and things of that nature. And so, because we, we are a maker of the things that go into our vehicles in some cases, we're also looking at, you know, how do we conserve water, how do we use recycled materials, you know, what are the things that help us, again, be more eco friendly than what you might think of as a traditional, RV and boat manufacturing business.

00:08:44:16 - 00:09:16:14
不明
So that's about Winnebago. In terms of what we've done at Winnebago, I gave you a little sneak peek. We have, we started with Digital Asset management. We had collections of digital assets everywhere. Hard drives, you know, drop drop sites. We had un scanned historical prop, assets that we wanted to have in a place so that, you know, we could we actually get questions from college students, for example, about Winnebago Industries, and they do research papers on us.

00:09:16:18 - 00:09:36:27
不明
So we needed a place to centralize our assets, make them searchable, findable and things of that nature. So we started with digital asset management, knowing that we would be moving on to websites next. And so we have launched several websites at this point, internal facing as well as external facing websites. And has helped us with, three of those external websites.

00:09:36:32 - 00:09:56:15
不明
As of right now. And then we've also brought our team along, which I'll talk about a little bit later in terms of upskilling and and our inclusion site, our internal employee inclusion site. It was created, it was, re platformed by my team, with the knowledge and skills that they, picked up partnering with Pro tivity because they're very much embedded in these development teams.

00:09:56:16 - 00:10:15:19
不明
It's not productivity comes in does and gives. It's, you know, comes in and partners with you and helps you learn, you know, what the technology is and how to create the pages and all of the good stuff in order to be sustainable. So, in terms of, you know, how we've done this, as I mentioned, we've been very acquisitive.

00:10:15:19 - 00:10:37:47
不明
And so we have a lot of technical debt. We've had to think about how those, you know, well, first we had to figure out what those assets were, and then we had to think about where they belonged. We created a Northstar architecture. Salesforce is part of our Northstar architecture. From a CRM perspective. And we've left ERP with a lot of the brands to figure out themselves based on what works for their manufacturing process.

00:10:37:52 - 00:10:59:40
不明
We have put a significant effort, effort into reducing that technical debt. And, you know, we had, kind of an emerging, recognition that we needed to invest in transforming our customer experience in order to kind of take Winnebago Industries to the next level. And so those were some of the drivers for why we looked at, a key here.

00:10:59:44 - 00:11:22:47
不明
And then, of course, I always, feel like if you don't know where you're going, you know, how do you know when you get there? And so, of course, we established, goal and vision, for our, organization as we started this transformation. And so, our goals were to improve the customer experience. That's what the executives signed off on, of course, and what the the marketing team was keen to do.

00:11:23:02 - 00:11:43:16
不明
But, we also needed to unlock technology. A lot of our brands, they were not experts in the technology that they had. There were a lot of security gaps, honestly, and some of the technology that they had, there was infrastructure that was failing and end of life and things of that nature. So we needed to improve our technical landscape as part of this, data, day to day to day to data.

00:11:43:17 - 00:12:05:32
不明
You know, it's all been about data at this conference to at least the sessions I've been sitting in. We, we don't have a good practice around data. You know, when we came into this program. And so it's like, well, to really get intimate with our customers, we're going to have to be better at data. And it's been really interesting talking with the business about their role in data, because to them, data is a technology thing.

00:12:05:32 - 00:12:25:38
不明
And I'm like, no data as a business thing. And I'm here to support you and making sure that you get the data you need to, you know, answer questions that you have and make decisions. But, you know, you've got a responsibility. We we co-own the data. And then the last piece was we just need to be able to measure, you know, progress.

00:12:25:40 - 00:12:44:46
不明
You know, we need to do reporting. We need to understand also where the industry is going. And so those were the goals as we set out on the transformation. And then of course, you know, our opportunities. You know, we wanted, to partner with somebody that would help us, would guide us and help us fix some of those issues that I just talked about.

00:12:44:46 - 00:13:03:06
不明
And so we've used positivity to flex up resources and bring in knowledge that we didn't have at Winnebago. We have used it to mature, our vision and our capabilities. We've we've, leveraged them. They actually did a presentation to us at one point in time. We said, we think we need a CEO. What's the CEO?

00:13:03:15 - 00:13:20:50
不明
What would that look like? How could you help us with that? And so, you know, they've really helped us mature our CEO. Think about what that would look like. Think about where we start. And kind of from a crawl, walk, run perspective, you know, how do you get from crawl to walk, to run on this journey that we're on together?

00:13:20:55 - 00:13:39:04
不明
And then of course, we, results. And Tina is going to talk a bit about the foundation that we've built. But we needed to have a scalable foundation. And, and she'll talk a little bit about the energy that we had to put into with our marketing teams. The brands don't want to be cookie cutters. They don't want to all look the same.

00:13:39:04 - 00:14:01:03
不明
They didn't want to be Winnebago sized. And in some cases, they feel like Winnebago was a direct competitor of theirs. And so we had to talk with them about, you know, in order to have shared assets, shared capabilities, shared business process. What does that look like? Because they're like, I'm not Winnebago. And when you acquired me, you said, we're going to be a house of brands.

00:14:01:17 - 00:14:19:57
不明
A lot of authority is going to be left with the business. You know your employees, you know your customers, you know your products. Like, we're not going to be corporate here, you know, trying to tell you what to do. But we are corporate here trying to help you achieve your goals. So with that, I'll hand it over to Tina.

00:14:20:12 - 00:14:46:40
不明
Thanks, Jenny. So I think you just did a great job introducing who we are as a firm. So fertility is a global consulting firm with a focus area in digital. So we really are focused on helping our clients and customers drive to solutions within the digital landscape, inclusive of creative, to design, technical support, oversight and advisory services and everything in between.

00:14:46:45 - 00:15:05:46
不明
And so we really encountered when we started this journey. We're actually think talking about this just last night. It's, you know, two years ago we started on this, but we started on this with Winnebago. I think the, the, the breadcrumbs were already laid for them, but we kind of had a, had a conversation around some of the immediate pains that they had.

00:15:05:51 - 00:15:35:42
不明
Short term wins that we felt we couldn't really come in and really help fix. And then in that half fixing we got talking about the needs to really develop, this, this center of excellence and creating this digital foundation for them, leveraging the Adobe ecosystem. It was a great kind of experience at the beginning. And really, it's fun to be here two years later, being able to talk about and reflect on this journey together.

00:15:35:47 - 00:16:03:18
不明
And so we're going to talk about this. Jennie mentioned there's two pillars, really. There's the Digital Foundation piece and then the SEO. This is how we look at it. The Digital Foundation is really about establishing the framework, the technologies and the infrastructure, around for this initial phase. It's really around the Am suite sites and assets, making sure we're incorporating a multi-tenant framework that allows you to scale up and incorporate that, that mission.

00:16:03:18 - 00:16:25:49
不明
So every brand has their own presence. Because we really also want to make sure that we're building this once mentality where things can be leveraged across, by all, but also making sure we're kind of incorporating the, the styles and the designs and incorporate on layered on top of that framework. And so the, the overall objective, you know, why do we even do this?

00:16:25:59 - 00:17:03:17
不明
It's really the brands needed to be elevated, right? Experience, digital experience. They just need that elevation. And, and and that means making sure we're moving away from brochure sites to customer experience. Right. Customers expect that experience. We're talking about, you know, luxury shoppers in some markets. We're talking about mid-market, buyers and others. So let's make sure that we're not just pushing a site out there that just tells you the features and the functions, but we want to incorporate, you know, personalization, the analytics, making sure your site is actually doing something for you and not just a place for people to visit.

00:17:03:22 - 00:17:24:15
不明
So that's where the measurement comes in. And making sure where we're scaling the infrastructure for personalization. And so there's a journey that doesn't end today. It's going to continue and it will evolve. But that is really where the governance model that comes in with the SEO and prioritizing what what is needed. And Jenny will talk about, you know, the steps in the first step.

00:17:24:15 - 00:17:49:55
不明
But, you know, there's there's this isn't a one and done right. And we recognize that we're on that path. And when to power the teams on the Winnebago side to to take the self-service approach by these tools to do that. But we're there to provide that advisory services and then augment for the technical support to make sure that, you know, you're using the systems the way that they're intended to get the most out of the investment.

00:17:50:00 - 00:18:10:16
不明
And so, you know, in the beginning, as Jenny mentioned, we sat around the table with both marketing and technology and started to talk about this vision. And there's a lot of that, that perception of, oh, this is not what I want to do. It's going to slow me down. It's going to make me put me in a box.

00:18:10:16 - 00:18:52:31
不明
And, you know, we can't we can't do it. Everybody needs their own systems. Well, we're proving it. You know, two years in that that's not the case, right? But we want to make sure that marketers and brand management have the capabilities and the technology to do, you know, elevate. But that shouldn't be behind how they work. Right. So we want to make sure that brand and marketing leadership are focusing on go to market strategies, focusing on the designs and styles and staying on brand, and, you know, test and learns and personalization and, and the things that drive the revenue but also making sure we're doing it on technology platform that saves dollars, right.

00:18:52:31 - 00:19:15:21
不明
At the end of the day, we're not driving revenue by implementing technology. We're driving revenue by enabling the marketers to really focus on what matters. And so in the from an I.T. and the leadership side, you know, we're talking about integrations and components and and architecture frameworks and personalization and content fragments and things like that. And it's iterative.

00:19:15:25 - 00:19:42:37
不明
You know, every time we we go and we create a new site, it's all about evaluation and figuring out the right mix. And we'll talk about that in a minute about how to how do we. Yeah. What's the right marriage of reusability to, customizations, layered on for each brand. So, you know, in order for us to achieve that brand identity, again, it's that core infrastructure.

00:19:42:42 - 00:20:03:51
不明
But recognizing that it's, you know, every site needs to look and feel the same way. So in order for us to kind of achieve this, you know, I don't want to give too much detail because this is all about the governance side of it. But really, you know, you got to do it. You have to do a lot of the planning that's required auditing, looking at, you know, across your, your business units.

00:20:03:51 - 00:20:23:34
不明
And again, where is that marriage of of consistency to customizations. And then, you know, we create that roadmap along the way to be able to execute against that, making sure we've got reusability where it makes sense. And so this is a this is an eye chart. But this is how it's done. Right. This is the this is the meat behind it.

00:20:23:35 - 00:20:50:15
不明
You know we we evaluated we identified you know how many templates are there. And this is a speak for anybody who's not an alum. These are kind of templates and components. Are all the pieces within that experience platform that are really needed to be able to identify reusability and, and, and things like that. So we looked we evaluated and we really this started the plan that we use this as the grid and said which one do we start with.

00:20:50:15 - 00:21:12:50
不明
Where do you start. And you know, so it it's it evolves from there. Looking for a reusability and then some things are going to be reusable. And so that's where the, you know, that that balance is needed. You have to make sure that you can customize, but also the make sure we're, we're identifying those things that are reusable.

00:21:12:55 - 00:21:39:07
不明
With that in mind. Right. We don't want to just build a site, we want to build experiences. So that's where you continue to mature the platforms. But you had to do it in a way that allows for it. So when we look at custom navigations and product recommendations and promotion of content or just basically get somebody to the site, look up a dealer that's in their area, I mean, these are basic things that were done differently for every brand.

00:21:39:12 - 00:22:02:25
不明
They like to be different, but at the end of the day, they're not always different. The styles are different. What they sell is different, but the experience is empowering that there's a lot of commonalities. And so that's part of our jobs, is to evaluate and plan the commonalities so that we can enable the personalization experience. This is this is the most simplest simplistic example of it.

00:22:02:33 - 00:22:24:33
不明
But you know, you're hearing a lot of the tools and things that are out there. But you know, we want to bring it down to the basics to defog all the technology talk and really just try to get the brands to understand the art of what is possible. So as Jenny mentioned, we've got, a couple of sites out there that we've done this for at this point.

00:22:24:33 - 00:22:44:08
不明
So when you go out to, Winnebago Industries is an example of one of the sites, you can see this is really a live site. It's built on the platform. And we started small. We started with a very focus on the corporate field. It is I think there's a. Yeah, yeah. So this site is when you go out, it plays the video.

00:22:44:13 - 00:23:04:52
不明
It kind of loops on that hero. And there's a lot more below that. But basically, you know, we wanted to make sure we built a site that allowed us to focus on the investors careers and really sets the stage to prove to the brands, like, okay, this is cool and doesn't have to look like a box of different pieces in a Lego stock stack.

00:23:05:06 - 00:23:24:33
不明
It can be fluid, it can look design friendly and things like that. So this was first step in the journey. And we really learned through this first step. We educated both the IT and the marketing groups on what was possible, how to author, you know, how to create, how do you create this beautiful design, but how do you actually bring it to life?

00:23:24:33 - 00:23:46:07
不明
So we really provided that that advisory service to help make sure we're elevating the team. But keeping, you know, the tenants of our commitment to the technology and making sure that's, you know, being consistent. We took those learnings and then we applied it to the next site. Chris Craft is another site that's out there. You guys are welcome to go visit.

00:23:46:11 - 00:24:10:00
不明
This is really you know, Chris Craft really is about craftsmanship. If anybody knows the brand, it's really about in the manufacturing is is incredible to watch how they build these boats. It's it's was it's amazing to see and we wanted to make sure that we brought that craftsmanship into the experience on the site. So again, corporate first because that was easier to tackle, easier to get buy in.

00:24:10:05 - 00:24:34:39
不明
But then, you know, then when we brought that forward into the Chris Craft brand, so this is again second site here that leverages consistent technology, consistent architecture assets, etc., from a technology foundation. But elevated an experience for folks looking, you know, for understanding what's available from a Chris Craft perspective. So we're taking those learnings.

00:24:34:39 - 00:25:00:10
不明
And what you just saw in the sizzle reel is the next one, which is Newmar. And that is a much more, involved experience is a lot more data there. There's there's a luxury experience with the Newmar brand. So we went from corporate to craftsmanship to luxury and we want. And the goal of the Newmar is to elevate the site so that, it feels luxury to the folks who are visiting it.

00:25:00:15 - 00:25:25:06
不明
And I will say, don't go too well if you could go to the Newmar site right now, the before the before visited in a month and you're going to see how elevated it. Well month there. Yeah. About a month, from here and you're going to get to see how, how that experience is elevated. So really, you know, just to summarize, where we're at, you know, we're onboarding brands into the, into this, infrastructure.

00:25:25:19 - 00:25:46:32
不明
And with that comes governance. And that's been critical. And that's what Jenny is going to talk about, is the governance side of it, the people in the process. Right. It goes back to people, processes and technology. Don't make technology drive the business, the business to drive the technology. And that requires that planning, reviewing, you know, you don't just doesn't happen on day one.

00:25:46:37 - 00:26:09:23
不明
Got to be committed to the planning process. You've got to prioritize what matters and making sure you're not, you know, hypersensitive to one feature. If that feature isn't going to help drive business revenue and impact to the customer. And from there, we identified what customizations are required. And that's the variance, right? So we're going to plan for the consistency and plan for the customizations.

00:26:09:28 - 00:26:29:45
不明
And then and from there we you know really it's about getting that site set up migration of content migrate and modernize. It's not just migrate one for one because why are you making the investment. Doesn't make sense. So really just making sure you're planning planning for customizations along the way, recognizing that's the reality. And then, really about authoring.

00:26:29:45 - 00:26:52:05
不明
And so with that, Jennie is going to talk about how do you make sure that what you set doesn't get forgotten and can scale? Yeah. Thanks, Tina. And I'll just share a little bit more about the Winnebago to Chris Craft. Piece of the journey. One of the things Chris Kraft is, you know, they build 250 boats a year, that are custom boats for individuals.

00:26:52:05 - 00:27:16:35
不明
And, they're very, frugal when it comes to their technical spend. So one of the things we were able to show them is the investment that had already been made on their behalf to this website with Winnebago Industries that they could pick up and run from, in order to save themselves a bit of an investment and to get out to market faster.

00:27:16:39 - 00:27:41:21
不明
And they had actually been partnering with another firm, on the design side, they went through customer journey, mapping things of that nature. But that firm was really having trouble getting them to done. And so we came out and, we were able to pick up the shared components and get them to done pretty quickly. And, and what, you know, was a project that they were starting to feel like might never happen.

00:27:41:34 - 00:28:06:47
不明
We delivered within a couple of months, at a, at, you know, at a price point they could live with. So, so, why build a center of excellence? I've talked a little bit already about unlocking the technical, capabilities that we knew that we needed in order to serve our customers better. So that was a major motivation for us.

00:28:06:52 - 00:28:31:53
不明
I've talked about unifying the data. We need to have, strong data, better data, improved data. And, you know, as well as the operating model side of what it takes to leverage that data in order to be able to deliver these personalized experiences for our customers. You know, when you've got a customer that spending a quarter of $1 million or more on a boat, a million plus on an RV, they expect an elevated experience.

00:28:31:53 - 00:28:48:47
不明
And we need to have better data in order to understand, you know, where they're at in their journey, whether they're a previous customer or not. You know, what kind of, research they've already done on our sites where they're at in the buying process. And so day to day to data, we also wanted to optimize our processes.

00:28:48:47 - 00:29:09:07
不明
And so before we started the journey, you know, a lot of, agency partners were supporting these legacy, websites. And so there wasn't a lot of control. There wasn't a lot of, they weren't thinking about the security because our businesses are not technically savvy that way. They're like, it's a site. Is it up often enough? You know, that was kind of their measurement.

00:29:09:12 - 00:29:29:28
不明
But as we, hired somebody to think about, enterprise security, she, of course, was, you know, screaming in her head, I think many times as she was understanding what the assets were that we're on our collection. And so we needed to have better processes and better governance around some of the technical pieces, but also the business side of it.

00:29:29:33 - 00:29:47:59
不明
Most of these, folks had outsourced agency partners that the creation of that site, because they were on platforms where they couldn't get in and make even a simple text change. So if you notice that, you wanted to tweak for a specific incentive, that you might have coming up, you wanted to tweak the language on the site.

00:29:48:12 - 00:30:06:38
不明
Well, that you had to go spend money with an outside agency and have them do it. And it was not minutes or hours. It was days and weeks for them to be able to turn that around. So we needed to optimize our processes. And of course we needed to manage change. Through all of this. We needed to work with our stakeholders to understand their needs.

00:30:06:52 - 00:30:31:15
不明
I came from a company before this where it was like we standardized everything. We standardized our business process, we standardized our look and Fiero, here's your colors. You know, and we did 35 acquisitions a year that was not going to be the path for Winnebago Industries and our brands. And so we needed to find out, you know, where they could give and where they, were unable to give without, you know, a lot of pain.

00:30:31:20 - 00:30:51:00
不明
And so, just like with any good road trip, we have a road trip. From a CIO perspective, you need to know where you're going. You need to know who's driving. You need to understand who's paying for gas. You need to understand what the rules of the road are, and you know, and follow them. You got to know if you got a call mom every night and let her know where you're at in the process.

00:30:51:05 - 00:31:08:28
不明
And when there is construction, you have to have a plan to get around it. And that's really similar to what you have to do when you're setting up a CEO. You start with envisioning principles, vision, mission, values, goals, things of those nature. You start to think about what does good look like, what are the results that we need?

00:31:08:33 - 00:31:33:21
不明
How are we going to fund it? How many days, weeks, months or years is this going to span over? Starts? Roadmap mapping kind of a process. You start to document your standards and what's expected. And again, stakeholder analysis is really critical in that because like I said, if I just come in with the way that I did it at the last place, I would have been shown out the door, probably by by my marketing partners.

00:31:33:26 - 00:31:52:37
不明
Reporting and transparency and communication is super important because they want to understand what they're getting for their money. They want to see that there's progress. A lot of times they've come in, they've come to me because I've got a reputation for delivery, and they're coming to me, and they've had a lot of broken trust and promises with their technical teams from these agencies.

00:31:52:47 - 00:32:15:35
不明
And so while I didn't create that reputation for technology, I've got to help, resolve that, that reputation for technology and show them that it can be better, it can be different. And then, of course, you incorporate lessons learned along the way, not just at the end. I know it's at the end of this journey, but I put a picnic table there because it is about conversations along the way.

00:32:15:40 - 00:32:37:49
不明
Many of our brands had never done agile projects before, and so we we introduced a sprinting process. That's a bit of a hybrid process, of course, because, you know, some of them can't afford they don't have people that sit in daily stand ups every single day. So how do we find the right process for them? And then there's other ones where they they want to be in that process every day, because maybe the trust isn't there yet.

00:32:37:54 - 00:32:57:46
不明
So governance kind of an ugly word. People never really like to talk about governance. Some people call it a necessary evil. I have been at organizations where I haven't called it governance because it would elicit a certain reaction, but whatever you want to call it, governance is about making sure you don't have misunderstandings along the way.

00:32:57:46 - 00:33:20:20
不明
It's about setting up the rules of the road and engagement. So, you know, you start with a structured agreement for how you're going to work together and you define an escalation path. You make sure that there's rapid decision making along the way by everybody understands what the process, the rhythm, the cadence is. By having that framework, who are the resources that are going to work on it?

00:33:20:20 - 00:33:39:52
不明
Who's dedicated, who's not dedicated? Who has to be engaged? At certain points in decision making process, even though they may be, not really familiar with the project. You know, what are the communication mechanisms that you're setting out? What are the bodies that need to be communicated with? What cadence do they need to be communicated with?

00:33:39:56 - 00:33:58:49
不明
Is that a meeting because they prefer to be across a table? Is that an in-person meeting? Because a lot of our brands, you know, they're in one location and they're not used to working with, even, you know, remote teams, let alone global teams. You have to do some stakeholder analysis, of course, understand what your stakeholders expect.

00:33:58:49 - 00:34:19:07
不明
And each of these brands are different. So you have to know the personality of the brands, the cultures of the brands. And then I always want to make sure that we empower the teams. And so I'm going to fly through this slide because the gist of it is I want the teams and the marketing stakeholders making the decisions is 80% the right number.

00:34:19:07 - 00:34:39:10
不明
I mean, I want it to be like a big number because it's like most of the decisions are made with that team, and then you've got a layer in the middle that says, here are our standards, and if you're going to go outside of it, you're not going to configure, you're going to build something custom. You know, you want to, you know, use this tool that we don't have in our Northstar architecture that's got to be reviewed.

00:34:39:10 - 00:34:57:31
不明
We brought in enterprise architecture and business architecture for the first time as part of this. And so, you know, let's let's make sure that we know what we're building and where we're deviating. We understand that. And it's a it's an agreement. And then if there isn't resolution or usually it's like we need more money or more time or more or something.

00:34:57:36 - 00:35:18:04
不明
Or we can't resolve that decision. Usually we can resolve the technical and process decisions, but if we can't, then of course there's an executive, steering committee. Mostly it's about communication with them, making they want to know that, you know, the investment that they're making, that we're actually proceeding to results. Now, this is our staffing model.

00:35:18:04 - 00:35:36:20
不明
This doesn't mean this is the only staffing model. I've put together lots of staffing models, but for us, we wanted to make sure we have Winnebago SMEs that are in Koa kinds of structures. And so not everyone can have a solution architect. Not everyone can have an enterprise architect in our industry because they just can't afford to have all of these roles.

00:35:36:25 - 00:35:55:43
不明
I'll go, I'll go in and talk about agility. And I'm like, well, you need somebody who who knows your processes, you know? So that's called a product owner. Usually there could be a product manager if you've got that structure, but you don't. So you just need somebody who's going to give us requirements, you know, so you know, blending in.

00:35:55:43 - 00:36:26:02
不明
I've got a solution architect, I have developers, you know, our enterprise, marketing, we has people that know data and analytics for customer that have done e-commerce kinds of sites before, that can help with, selecting good brand partners, agency partners and things like that. So we have a collection of individuals in enterprise marketing and in enterprise IT that are SEOs that are here to help these brands, with these resources that, you know, they maybe can't afford on their own.

00:36:26:06 - 00:36:46:24
不明
And then, of course, we help them pick the right partners. And in our Adobe space, that's pro tivity. And, and then, you know, we also help them where needed. But we, we recognize the need for them to also have outside agencies for, for things that, you know, we're not going to bring from a technology perspective, enterprise marketing's not going to bring from that perspective.

00:36:46:33 - 00:37:04:05
不明
But they need they're and they're not going to be able to full time employees, photographers and videographers and people that put together digital collateral and things like that. Some of them have it some in-house. Most of them don't. And so where are we going next? This is where I would just give you the cue up to if you have questions.

00:37:04:06 - 00:37:25:47
不明
The room is not set up to easily get to a microphone. So we'll do a shout out, shout out and repeat. But we're going to, pause for questions here shortly. So where are we going next? Obviously we still have digital assets to migrate with our newest acquisition. They're on a path. We still have some brands that have not started to move to the Adobe platform.

00:37:25:47 - 00:37:46:15
不明
They're working on CRM initiatives. And the other side of my SEO. And we still have some internal sites that probably need to be moved over, but we kind of this has been established. We have trust and credibility. They know that we're here for them. They're on a roadmap for, you know, when their time is, is going to come for this.

00:37:46:15 - 00:38:12:49
不明
We understand when they're ready to invest in those things. And so really for us, the next step that we're exploring because again, you know, have a plan, what's the next thing on the roadmap? For us it's about data and analytics and understanding how we're going to start to, support those teams with Adobe capabilities there, as well as with our data so that, we've been standing up for the last couple of years as well at the enterprise side of things.

00:38:12:49 - 00:38:35:00
不明
So, you know, where do they store their data? What can they get out of their data? It's been fun running some AI posse's with them about searchability of knowledge, you know, about products and, floor plans and things like that. So that's what we're teeing up next is. Okay, now that you've got your stuff in a place and you know your customers are using it, how do we use the data?

00:38:35:05 - 00:39:01:12
不明
So with that, I hand it to, Tina for the really sexy slides that are at the end of these. So we wanted to leave time plenty of time for questions. So please, you know, as Jenny said, it's a hard room. So we'll do our best to repeat questions and whatnot. And then, you know, per the Adobe Summit, you guys want to do your Starbucks and and headphones headphones.

00:39:01:16 - 00:39:19:32
不明
Now would be that time to do that survey or not. Now, and then we also have a booth available for anybody who doesn't get a question in here. You know, please swing by or you reach out after this. And we're happy to to answer anything that wasn't already discussed. All right. Well, thank you so much. Thank you all.
