When technology and creativity converge. New industry standards are set. Coding theory is the place where the world's most ambitious brands come to experience. Change 50%. Creatives 50%. Engineers DNA design to build, break, remake and reinvent everything in 2025. We experienced change. New leadership, new network. Same vision, same ambition. We revolutionize how fans engage with the greatest game on the planet.

Build virtual bridges between major leagues and everyday athletes. Now, with our busy schedules, sleep, unfortunately, is sometimes the first thing that we sacrifice and overlook. We use data to tell the story of a nation as it unfolded in real time. Let's take a look. Because there have been a lot coming out there in the last couple of days.

As we've always done, we will continue to transform our clients and ourselves again and again and that is the one thing we will never change.

00:02:10:17 - 00:02:36:29
不明
Who? Just. Just for the record, our comms team is here, and they made me do that. Like, that was an awesome video. Thank you guys for joining us. We are not going to make you stare at the screen with slides. So if that's what you wanted, you're not getting that in this session. We're just going to have a conversation about how AI is transforming how brands and agencies work.

00:02:37:02 - 00:03:01:23
不明
I'm Hannah Elle Soccer. I am the head of Global New Business Ventures at Adobe and proud founder of the Firefly for enterprise products that you saw on stage yesterday and main stage. And I'll let Travis introduce himself. Hey, I'll. I'm Mike. I'm CEO of Coding Theory. Thanks for coming to our talk today. Terrific. So we're going to self-monitor at each other, which could turn into a disaster.

00:03:01:24 - 00:03:19:27
不明
I think it's scary. So we have some questions that will just kind of riff off of each other, and then we'll save plenty of time. It's a small group, and if you have questions, we'll put on makeup and just try to answer, as you know, answering questions as we go. Okay. So I think the first one was really about, hey, there's this thing called AI.

00:03:19:29 - 00:03:56:20
不明
It's changing really how we think. It's transforming creative and the creative craft. And maybe before we get into how agencies and brands work, how do you just see Gen I just changing how coding theory does. Yeah. Approach things like creativity. Sure. Well good question. First let's start with if you're a creative human being and you're not excited right now by having all of these new tools at your disposal and having all these new ways to be creative and have all this innovation in front of you, where you can really do things that you could never do before faster, better, you know, in ways that you never imagined, like you're probably not a creative and you're

00:03:56:20 - 00:04:15:25
不明
probably in the wrong industry because this we are at a moment, as you know. Yeah. From Firefly, we are at a moment where, you know, things that were not possible are now possible. And it's not just the generative AI piece where, you know, people look for efficiency and people look for performance, which is really important and part of the plan.

00:04:15:27 - 00:04:43:25
不明
But the way in which you can create and imagine like experiences, solutions, connections and relationships with your customers as a brand like that changes everything. So as an agency, like we try to incorporate that, and it started for us with just curiosity and experimentation, which is, I'm sure, how it started for you. Yeah. I mean, for us, I mean, Adobe's obviously has a lot of surface area across marketing, creativity and document productivity.

00:04:43:28 - 00:05:07:24
不明
And this conference, the heritage many of you have been coming for many years, is really about martech transformation. And what we saw the last couple of years is lots of companies have invested in Blank Pipe, right? CDP, journey optimizers, analytics, all that great stuff. But then they were realizing they have a bit of a problem filling the pipes with enough content and on brand content that's engaging you.

00:05:07:24 - 00:05:31:23
不明
Add to that the fact that the speed of social, you guys may have told me this too, but, you know, our assets pretty much go dead on arrival after a week and multiply that by the number of channels that you need to refresh. I've actually heard one of the brands tell me that they have analytics that say, if your consumer has seen the same creative three times, they get really upset with the brand and they kind of disengaged from the brand.

00:05:31:23 - 00:06:00:05
不明
So the worlds are melding together. So we spent ten years on martech. I think we're on the early innings of what I would call like there's no creative tech word, but like the stack, the creative stack is starting to get. Innovators and agencies like yourself and other partners are super leaning in. Because to your point, taking the drudgery out is going to free you to do better creative work, better marketing, and be right there for your customer on time.

00:06:00:08 - 00:06:16:01
不明
And I think that's a critical piece of, you know, to your question of how does it affect an agency like ours? Like we have to start asking ourselves, I think all agencies should start asking themselves, like, how do they want their humans to spend their time? Like, what is the highest value for the humans? For the clients of an agency?

00:06:16:03 - 00:06:37:00
不明
And like, that's a really significant question because it's not just the obvious. Like software can do things that once took a lot of humans to so it's faster and cheaper and is better. And it like solves the content supply issue that you're you're definitely demonstrating and talking about, but really having an understanding of where your skills and your people and your talents can create value for your clients.

00:06:37:03 - 00:07:01:28
不明
And then how do you want your people to spend their time doing so? That's like the place you start. If you're an agency and you're thinking about what to do about this, because then you change the way you work, then you change the way you engage your clients because you're not you're getting out of the drudgery of production and delivery, and you're getting into, how can I find high value opportunities to really drive your business as a client?

00:07:01:28 - 00:07:20:16
不明
And then those relationships are changing and the market, if I can say, is going to force that because, look, we're here at, you know, summit. Right. And to your point, there's tons of technology and software to be bought and that people are buying that solve a lot of these problems. Clients aren't gonna want to pay twice for these types of things.

00:07:20:23 - 00:07:39:29
不明
They're not gonna want to pay for the software and then pay the agency to operate the software to get the same output. So it even changes that which we're seeing, which I'm sure you're seeing, too, in the way, you know, you're engaged with your clients about what they want to buy and how they want to buy it and why they're buying it.

00:07:40:02 - 00:07:59:01
不明
You know, coughing fit. So let me keep going. So I'm going to get so that that's part of it. So then after that, if you're an agency today and the question of how is changing agency client relationships like our clients, most of our clients are at a place where they're looking for what we call like phase one.

00:07:59:03 - 00:08:20:08
不明
They're looking for efficiencies, looking for cost savings. They're looking for you to do more with either the same amount of money or less amount of money from just a deliverables perspective. So if you used to pay me X dollars to make you know why things, now I want to spend either x or x minus some percentage to make y plus some percentage of things and everyone's shaking their head.

00:08:20:08 - 00:08:43:17
不明
This is very affirming. Thank you so you know we really we understand that there's different expectations on the relationship. And so everyone is in that phase one of like efficiency and performance. And frankly the software is going to solve most of that. And that's like what Adobe does best. Can can we talk about I mean, the elephant in the room and the early days, but why some brands agencies have kind of leaned in, but some brands have.

00:08:43:17 - 00:09:03:06
不明
It is well, what about human creativity? What about how does that change jobs? Am I going to lose my job and leave? You know, we also hear there's like a tell people who don't want to use it at all. So how do you think about that and upskilling or process changes in the work? It's a great question and it's a real question.

00:09:03:08 - 00:09:24:04
不明
Let's break it down into a couple of components. So component one, just the resistance to it. I would say that's futile because just like all technical innovation, you can resist it as long as you want. But like to quote my friend Dan Gardner over here, founder of Coding Theory right there, he he says technology is undefeated. And he's 100% right about that.

00:09:24:06 - 00:09:42:04
不明
You know, show me the technology that lost over the arc of time. The app. We don't use the abacus anymore. I use Excel, correct. Because it's been replaced by better technology. Exactly. So that's just futile. So the resistance that's you either embrace it or yeah, you're going to lose your job. So we I believe I'll just speak for myself.

00:09:42:04 - 00:09:59:15
不明
This is not a coding theory position, but it's a Microsoft position. If you don't embrace AI as someone who works in a creative organization as an example, like you're not going to be working in that creative organization for a long time. And the for that much longer. And the people who do embrace it are going to find new ways to do it, a new value to unlock.

00:09:59:17 - 00:10:22:26
不明
So yeah. Then there's the fear piece. So there's resistance and there's the fear. Fear is just about, I think, familiarity and curiosity and being interested in learning and interested in doing new things. And hopefully you build an organization with a culture like that and you have a legal team that lets you. That's also important. But a lot of that fear is also going to be like the legal side fear things.

00:10:22:26 - 00:10:42:02
不明
That's going to just be removed because all this technology is going to either be in your workflow or there's been like no real legal issues anyway. And plus, if you're using Adobe, you're fine plug. But so then it goes to the, you know, are people going to lose their jobs. And like I just touched on it, but yes, people are going to lose their jobs.

00:10:42:05 - 00:11:01:23
不明
And yes, there's going to be people are going to have to find a different way to create value for themselves and their clients. And that's just true. Now, the beautiful thing about new technology is that you don't have to be upskilled and retrained to just experiment with AI, and to be someone who's on the cutting edge of it.

00:11:01:23 - 00:11:22:14
不明
Yes, if you want to do engineering and implement platforms and stitch the data together, yeah, they're still there. But also with any new technology, new jobs are created, right? So things that an agency like ours used to not do, we're now going to do. And that's going to create opportunity. Yeah. Aakash Shantanu likes to say humans won't be replaced by AI.

00:11:22:14 - 00:11:44:28
不明
They'll be replaced by humans who know how to use AI. So I think that's literally what you do. That's what you just said. I'll give you like a little story. Like, I've talked to some creatives who were junior designers when Photoshop came out and they told me that there was the same resistance, like there were people who were like, I'm sticking with my sketchbook, I'm not using that thing.

00:11:45:01 - 00:12:03:01
不明
And they raise their hand to learn Photoshop like they were in a bit of a minority in the age of digital marketing. Who do you think? Career. Yeah, maybe accelerated more or less. It's going to become ubiquitous at some point. People said that when the printing press came out, people said that one camera came out like, this is all true, right?

00:12:03:01 - 00:12:20:12
不明
Yeah. So can I ask you a question? Of course. So you were, you know, at the beginning of Firefly. Yeah. And you have experience with that. So you dealt first hand with like the first wave of fears around this. And when you were creating it, what was sort of your guiding principle for what you were trying to solve for.

00:12:20:14 - 00:12:43:28
不明
So as a company, obviously creativity is at our center, the creator community is at our center. And so we made a very conscious choice to come out with models that were only trained on license data. So we didn't come out like the way we came out was we felt like we wanted to come out right to market. So I can say the my legal team has my back.

00:12:44:00 - 00:13:10:11
不明
Every piece of content that went in, we had license to we know where it came from or a creator got paid for that content that was really, really important to us. So that was just a philosophy that we had. But the other thing is, I think the model. So commercial safety obviously then parlays into brands getting very comfortable, agency partners getting very comfortable depending on where you are in the workflow, if you're ideating and that thing will never see the light of day, use whatever model you want.

00:13:10:18 - 00:13:31:17
不明
But I have increasingly customers that come to me and say, my legal team is asking me to rip and replace the thing I was using and and use Adobe, because at least I know where everything is. With content authenticity. I can also trace every piece of content. So that was the principle. The other principle is like, you know, we do have a large surface area of modalities as well.

00:13:31:19 - 00:13:54:05
不明
So image was the first set of models that came out. You've seen the video models that have been released in beta and playing with those 3D vector. All these modalities start to build on each other. And I think, that actually democratizes for an individual creator who can now not just be a specialist in illustrator and vector can actually work across modalities, which is pretty kind of cool.

00:13:54:05 - 00:14:34:09
不明
Yeah. And so great. So I'll pick up on what you're saying there to the question earlier about like how is it changing the agency client relationships. Like I believe, rightly or wrongly, clients are going to expect their agencies to do more. And I don't just mean in the delivery mode. I mean, when you used to go to me because I was not me, but when your social agency acts and you were my social agency and that's what you did, like channel agencies or like type mode agencies to pull on multimodal, that's going to recede over time, because the interconnectivity of all of the content of understanding users of where you want to distribute it, a

00:14:34:09 - 00:14:55:02
不明
versioning of like all the things that I can do really fast if you want to take the real halo of AI, whether it's in the generative piece or in the compute piece, or in the segmentation and distribution piece, whatever it may be, if you want to get the value out of that, there has to be a convergence across the client organization of like what used to be discrete briefs.

00:14:55:05 - 00:15:09:15
不明
And anyone who's worked in an agency or worked with agencies knows what we're talking about. So like, you're not going to have a future where it's like, this is the brief for the website redesign, and this is the brief for the social thing. And this is the brief for the big hero campaign. Like these all need to connect.

00:15:09:17 - 00:15:27:04
不明
And so if you're an agency you have to think about, well, what are you doing with teams with skills that you're building to be able to respond to that? Like are you an agency sort of like code and theory where, you know, we work across the C-suite, we work across all those different modes because we can't be successful in providing value to our client.

00:15:27:11 - 00:15:48:19
不明
If our CMO and our CTO are not working together, it's just not possible anymore, especially because of the software and because of how horizontal that gets. So it does change the expectation. I think that clients will have agencies in their relationship with them and we won't have sort of single purpose player for that much longer. So maybe expand on that.

00:15:48:19 - 00:16:16:24
不明
More so how does that change the actual relationship between current theory or. Yeah, or the other, you know, agencies with the C-suite. So I'll just speak for coding theory. You know, what we have done is we've brought in expertise and built real solutions and practices around doing this. Looking at you, Cory. So, you know, we built, an an enterprise experience transformation practice.

00:16:16:24 - 00:16:33:01
不明
What does that mean? It's a lot of words. Basically, it's to understand how organizations of today are looking at their martech and looking at their ways of working and looking at their capabilities and seeing what the gap is to where they need to be tomorrow, given the revolution that's happening in software and most of that, that's like 50%.

00:16:33:03 - 00:16:54:01
不明
We can argue about the percentages, but that's like 50% the software and the martech, and it's 50% the way of working in change management in the organization. And like we need to be able to do that. So we're building a practice to be able to do that so that we can partner with our clients at a strategic level to unlock value, because ultimately this is all about value.

00:16:54:03 - 00:17:14:08
不明
You know, our client organizations are spending more money than ever on software and on martech and all the other pieces. They're also spending a lot more implementing all of that. They're also spending a lot more on the change management around that and changing their skills and their people and their ways of working. And at some point there has to be an ROI on that.

00:17:14:10 - 00:17:38:00
不明
And so when there's an ROI on that, the partners who can go upstream, be consultative, lead that change effort, handle it through and through. And also, by the way, still, do you still do the things that agencies do really well make creative, make experiences, build communications, launch brands, build websites, build apps like that. Being all connected is going to be what is expected.

00:17:38:00 - 00:17:56:04
不明
So we want to be performant for our clients. We need to be able to do that. It's interesting. I'm just going to pick up on ROI. I think when, Jen, I first at the scene, I was probably late 20 to early 20, 22, 23 and everyone was in play mode. Nobody was thinking about AI. They were just like experiments.

00:17:56:06 - 00:18:15:07
不明
Now what I'm finding at the end of 24 and 25 is people are trying to lean in, but now you're talking with your CFO, right? And your CFO was like, what's the business case for the millions of dollars you want to invest? I'll just give you the Adobe example. We like to be customer zero on our own products.

00:18:15:09 - 00:18:41:18
不明
And last year, in the summer, our, CEO, who was our acting CMO, said, we're going to implement Firefly services for Black Friday. And interestingly, the team was a little resistant because there's a process and there's a father used to we went through that. At the end of that, we saw over 50% efficiency and time saved, and the team was actually happy.

00:18:41:19 - 00:18:59:11
不明
At the end. There was some pain, no doubt there was some pain in the middle. But when we start to see like 50% returns on time, people are like, spend the money. It's unlock, right? And you saw it and you did it on yourself. And that's a really credible way to then take it to your customers. It's a real thing.

00:18:59:11 - 00:19:21:18
不明
But your point on the CFO is another great point for agency change. Very rarely in the history of agencies was there like a direct conversation between like an agency lead and a CFO of a client about where their business is going and why it's going that way and what you can do to be value for it. But like, we have to be fluent in CFO speak now.

00:19:21:20 - 00:19:42:05
不明
We have to build business cases around what we're doing and why we're doing it. It's not like, is this a great concept for the ad campaign, or do you like the UX of this PDP? It's like, show me the business case for why I need to implement this software. Put the content supply chain in, retrain my team and then show me what the like where that return on investment is going to be.

00:19:42:05 - 00:20:07:10
不明
And like an agency, we didn't speak that fluently. If you'd hired coding theory in 2010, like that's not how we talked, right? But we had to we have to learn how to talk that now, because it is all converging around what that investment looks like. And so if you have proof cases where in your organization where you can say we did X, it productivity increased by Y, you know, cost was short term and amortize.

00:20:07:10 - 00:21:04:15
不明
And here's where the return comes in. If you're an agency and you're able to have those types of conversations, you're going to win. Yeah. Maybe we can talk about specific use cases that we've implemented. I think we have one more sizzle. We'll roll. And then we'll talk about yeah. And say.

00:21:04:17 - 00:21:11:02
不明
I.

00:21:11:04 - 00:21:21:28
不明
Know I.

00:21:22:00 - 00:21:36:19
不明
That's pretty dope. And I'm totally going to ignore all of our competitors that were in there. That's one. I clear this with you, and I know I'm kidding. It was a good joke. Let's get to it. I know it's for the crowd. It's for the crowd. So let's talk use cases and actual customer examples. You go first.

00:21:36:21 - 00:21:58:18
不明
Those were some of ours, but. Oh, no. Yeah. No. Please. Please. So in our case, I think what we're seeing working directly with, enterprises is they definitely feel like the bar for creatives is going up and up and up back to CMAs or asked for five x the content they were asked for last year. Their friends, the CFOs, are saying flat to down budgets.

00:21:58:21 - 00:22:24:02
不明
That's a tough math problem to figure out. And so we've started working with everyone from Mattel. You could see 4000 toys a year. The name of the game for them is decreasing the time to market. They're using it in packaging innovation. They're using it in ideation for dolls and shrinking that that supply chain down tremendously. You can also see Paramount as an example.

00:22:24:02 - 00:22:46:17
不明
If anyone has kids, maybe saw the movie F. It was a one key part. You know, point of F is like imaginary friends. And so they wanted to engage the customer and create a unique experience where you could generate your own imaginary friends in the style of the movie. F that was like a very high social engagement campaign for them.

00:22:46:17 - 00:23:05:17
不明
So those are some of the examples that we're using. Gatorade is another one that we've done, with the custom eye bottles, but people are definitely leaning in and unlocking the power of of I 100%. So from our perspective, all of those use cases apply anywhere where personalization can be applied in a piece of content distributed on channels.

00:23:05:17 - 00:23:31:14
不明
Paid channels doesn't really matter. Certainly anything that affects supply chain. And you can do like on bottle as you mentioned, like that's a huge use case. I mean even Coke talked about that yesterday, right. Where we think it's going however is different. So like the content volume and personalization at massive scale and even like anticipatory content, that's like different because if you think about it like personalization is like reactive.

00:23:31:14 - 00:23:47:18
不明
It's like, I know a data point, know I can do something and push it out, but I is pretty good at like compute and thinking about anticipatory models. So you can be ahead of even what a customer might think or even know or even indicate that they might want. Like that's a huge piece of it that will play out in content.

00:23:47:20 - 00:24:16:17
不明
But we really think the next phase of use cases are in experiences, are in actually generative experiences like generative UX, generative UI, where your experience. I'm just pointing at you because right here, your experience on a PDP, for example, that PDP might look completely different and nothing like my experience on a PDP because you came in from a different place and there was so much about you because of you've been there before, what you've looked at, etc. your triggers to buy whatever it may be like.

00:24:16:19 - 00:24:40:25
不明
Generative experiences are the next piece because then, because then that's the use case where all of a sudden it's not just the content still in a push or a pull, but it's everything surrounding the relationship with that customer. Is that generative or like really great assembly at the edge assembly. Great question. It's kind of both. So it has to be both.

00:24:40:28 - 00:25:01:24
不明
It's generally agree with a. Yeah. Because generate generative still takes like nine seconds to generate. So right depending on what it is. Yeah exactly. But it has to be both. So like in the future I'm kind of where we're building it and where the use cases are going. There are like these systems that you're going to have to have, you're going to have to have like a brand system, then understands your brand, your model trained on your brand.

00:25:01:24 - 00:25:32:13
不明
It has all your input. It knows how to behave and how to speak. It knows you look and feel. It knows your tone. It knows all these things. It generates your content ultimately. So the brand and the content live in a system. Then there's like a design system and I don't mean it in the traditional sense of what we have today, where it's like a set of modules, but like there's atomization of what experiences get built out of, to your point where it's the components of like UX and UI, the fundamental components of it, the understanding of like how it will orient, is it on a mobile or is it on a desktop?

00:25:32:13 - 00:26:02:24
不明
What are we trying to do on a page like this, etc.. So then there's your design system and then there's your data system. Right. And your data system is like the triggers. Yeah. What what am I looking at in order to compute and compose all these things and that are the those are the use cases that we're starting to build out now, which for some reason, some clients are more open to that exploration than the content exploration like singularly, because the content exploration, it's like there's still a sense of control on it that maybe they still want.

00:26:02:24 - 00:26:26:19
不明
Whereas generating or composing an experience in real time like that doesn't feel that's like a natural thing, that technology makes sense, that it should. You. And so I like to draw this differentiation because people want to talk about generative, but sometimes what they really want to talk about is smart assembly. Which means that in the dam somewhere, you need to have atoms, enough atoms to mix.

00:26:26:25 - 00:26:55:27
不明
Yeah. And the secret is most consumer brands don't. They don't really personalize against more than a couple segments. They're not doing any 100 segments. So the idea that you could actually pre generate and I think on brand enough in to to remix is part of the unlock. I could see why you then would retain control because you probably do have a review and approval cycle for the, you know, 5000 assets that you're going to have.

00:26:55:29 - 00:27:16:16
不明
But it will feel very unique to me when I show up. Correct? Yeah, correct. So like the for the use case piece. And again back to the agency client relationships like these are not conversations that you were having or even having to understand when the brief was just build might make my PDP look better and move the button here or here or here.

00:27:16:16 - 00:27:34:11
不明
What is what is the analytics say about like where are the best? No, the bar needs to be a little rounder. Yeah, exactly. That's usually the feedback. Exactly. So these are like totally different types of conversations. And to the point we were having earlier, this is like a conversation where the CFO has to be involved because it totally changes the way the appropriate technology and CapEx spend and all these other pieces.

00:27:34:13 - 00:27:53:17
不明
The CMO has to be involved because they have a huge oversight on it. Probably the product team has to be involved because generally sites can be owned, especially if they're like commerce based, can be owned by by by product teams. Right. The analytics piece and the CIO has to be involved in that. Because how do you get the data model to be right, unless you're plugging in all the right things to it and making sure that that works.

00:27:53:17 - 00:28:12:00
不明
And so, you know, the future, the future relationships between clients and agencies, like if unless you're fluent in these things, I just I don't know how you don't get kept, keep getting squeezed on the dollars like the agency keeps getting squeezed on the dollar side because people expect this stuff to be cheaper and cheaper if you're doing it the old way, that's fair.

00:28:12:03 - 00:28:43:16
不明
So we've talked about experiences, web experiences. We've talked about physical product content, other other use cases that you're seeing in motion. Yeah. I mean, for sure. I mean, we use we use gen I in research more than we've ever used any other sort of data set historically. So, you know, we do things like we we will build personas of the key segments of our clients.

00:28:43:16 - 00:29:02:09
不明
So if our if our clients say, hey, these are the six segments we're going after in this conquest campaign, etc., etc., we'll build models for all of them. We will then run our research and insights against them to get to a brief. We will then run the creative against the models, against the personas before we even deploy any of it.

00:29:02:09 - 00:29:29:08
不明
So we have pre optimized creative before we spent $1, and we found that the AI personas are generally more accurate in predicting performance of the creative than human feedback and traditional research. So we find applications in research all the time. We find applications in just using it as compute all the time. To just be able to synthesize things much faster than we ever could.

00:29:29:11 - 00:29:51:07
不明
So, for example, you know, you win a you win a client, you got to onboard the team that used to take weeks, sometimes months to get everyone through it. Now there's a brain right here that can onboard you immediately. And be your copilot on that account. You know, I'm I'm excited about the video use cases, on the 3D use cases.

00:29:51:10 - 00:30:11:24
不明
So if you've used our beta of the video model that we have, you can do text to video, which I think is a great use case mostly for media, but for agency and for brand. I love the, image to video use case because you can take a still of something that's approved, use it as a reference in the model and get a five second.

00:30:11:26 - 00:30:34:09
不明
Essentially video back. We all know video is like nine times more engaging than a still, and usually you don't have a budget to shoot video. So I love that application. And then just take it one step further with our 3D technology that we're now playing with. If you give me a still or two stars, I can create a complete turntable out of that product.

00:30:34:09 - 00:30:55:03
不明
We also know and PDP's for Commerce. Like if you've got a turntable like people, people love that stuff. Localization is another one that I'm, I think this opens up lots of vectors for. We usually only support the top couple of markets. Yeah. And I think with generative great translation we have, we have avatar lip sync technology dubbing.

00:30:55:06 - 00:31:19:29
不明
You can start to reach markets that you probably would not have natively reached. There's no question that's true. Can I ask you a question. Yeah. That. Have you found it easier to engage like end client user organizations with additional use cases and expanding, you know, deeper into their AI journey or agencies? Oh, I'm going to say yes. No, I'm kidding.

00:31:20:01 - 00:31:45:04
不明
So I think in early in the journey, there are a couple of brands and enterprises that are very lean forward, and therefore they were interested in experimenting at like a serious level with us going in. What I would say for all of our agency partners is, like you grok it. This was a tectonic shift for the agency landscape, and you all got it pretty quick.

00:31:45:06 - 00:32:13:23
不明
I would say stag. Well, the stag well, family was one of the earliest people to come and say, we got to figure out how to use this. It often helps if we both go in to talk to the customers, because there's still a pretty big education gap. Like probably everyone in this room has used many tools, understands lots, but if you haven't used it, there's an education gap and there's a there's a gap on understanding the ROI and the use cases where it applies.

00:32:13:23 - 00:32:41:08
不明
So I would say you just you guys get it, easier. You will also find just generally the creatives in your teams are embracing new technology and more and new tools that make sense. The that that makes sense. So okay, so then I guess another question would be on sort of on top of that is like when you when you.

00:32:41:10 - 00:32:55:12
不明
So as the agent, you just made a great point about it's easier to pitch if you go in together with the change management. It's like, yeah, you know, we went in together to be like not literally together, but like if we're coordinated on it and we're going in together on it, it's much easier to get an end result.

00:32:55:17 - 00:33:15:09
不明
That's another big change that you pointed out in, like the agency client relationship is, you know, we're supposed to show up with technology and partners and our partner partner ecosystem in technology that is so much deeper than it ever was historically. Yeah. You know, we need that's totally true. We would just like be like, hey, by some Creative Cloud.

00:33:15:09 - 00:33:45:22
不明
We'll see you later, right? Yeah. And now we kind of have to. Yeah. Right. Go to go in together. So a huge change in the agency relationship with the client is now they expect us to sort of validate the technology and show up with the partners and, you know, bring the right ones to bear and act in sort of an advisory capacity, but also having the partner relationships where if they're going to implement a part like a new piece of technology on the client side, or we're going to use it for them, like there's reliability between I don't mean legal liability, but like relationship liability.

00:33:45:22 - 00:34:09:09
不明
Yeah. Between the client, the agency and the tech partner. And they're in that together. I think it's changed our relationship 100%. Where, you know, we're developing together, you're teaching us. But thought leadership wise, I think brands are asking us, where do I start? How do I start? And that has probably changed our relationship. Definitely. You're definitely inside under NDA.

00:34:09:09 - 00:34:25:21
不明
You know, our roadmaps now. Whereas maybe before you wouldn't we I understand your business model and your client base and how you serve them so much better. You. Thank you so much, guys. Thanks, Jim. Look.

00:34:25:24 - 00:34:26:13
不明
Who?
