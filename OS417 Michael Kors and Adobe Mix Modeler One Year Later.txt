Hi everyone. Thank you for joining today's session about Adobe Mix Modeler and my co-host journey with it. Throughout the last year my name is Peter Cook. I'm a solutions consultant at Adobe based in Germany, and I'm very happy that I have a partner for today's session. I am man, it's ironic. I'm the global VP of Analytics and Data Science for KP Holdings, which is resources in between Michael Kors by our bags.

00:00:26:21 - 00:00:45:23
不明
Cool. So what will we talk about today? We will talk a little bit about today's challenges for marketers and how Adobe Mix Modeler can help with them, as well as Michael course journey with the tool. So when I was four years old, my siblings and I thought it was a great idea to doodle all over our wallpaper in our room.

00:00:45:23 - 00:01:04:12
不明
And because my parents hated that they made us tear it down and put up new wallpaper. And the question that they had was, what made us do it? So was it that we didn't have any papers left? Was it that we got this really cool new pen we wanted to use? Was it my sister who just wanted us to do some mischief?

00:01:04:14 - 00:01:28:12
不明
Or maybe it was just a mixture. Out of all of these different factors, but whatever it was, in the end, all of these different factors together, made us convert to wallpaper criminals. And that's very similar to the question mark was having nowadays. Right. What different touch points, what activities actually help our customers to convert? What make them take that purchasing decision in the end?

00:01:28:15 - 00:02:03:11
不明
And it's not an easy question to answer, right? Marketers are struggling to prove the incremental impact of marketing activities and use that to then prioritize the right channels to drive business outcomes. Marketing budgets are tight. We want to make sure that every marketing dollar we spend is spent wisely, and it's harder than ever because consumers nowadays have more than 70 core digital touchpoints, and the customer journey is so complex and expense across multiple channels from, display to website to email, there's lots going on.

00:02:03:14 - 00:02:29:10
不明
And all of these different touchpoints obviously are associated with cost, and it's very hard to tell in which way these touchpoints actually contribute to the conversion. In the end, because this is so complex, basic KPIs don't really provide a comprehensive picture of how marketing drives value and mark just are struggling to operationalize true measures of marketing success if they want to do it.

00:02:29:10 - 00:02:51:21
不明
There's a lot of data involved. There's many stakeholders they need to involve, and often companies are lacking the required resources or skills to actually provide meaningful insights. So many would you agree with this? It's or do you have other challenges in mind that I might have forgotten here? Have many challenges in mind, but no, I would 100% agree.

00:02:51:23 - 00:03:15:21
不明
I think that more and more, we're being demanded to deliver, with less budget potentially, or staying flat year over year. But the way consumers are navigating today and the multiple different pathways they're taking before, essentially they even consider purchasing from us or converging from us, it just makes it really, really much harder for us to, essentially, attribute to sales correctly.

00:03:15:27 - 00:03:35:18
不明
So having tools like yours, has, has made a significant difference for us because we are able to get closer to the pathways the consumer journey and therefore, make sure our dollars are working little bit harder for us, to, to lead them to conversion as well. So that's been very exciting. Yeah. That's, that's why we also found, or with different research found.

00:03:35:18 - 00:03:58:05
不明
Right. So marketers are struggling to prove the efficiency of their marketing activities, and they often turn to media mix modeling, to answer questions around the impact of the marketing activities. But they find it lacking and they're looking for better or faster media, mixed modeling or for some kind of, incremental lift testing. So, data is very important, right?

00:03:58:08 - 00:04:18:26
不明
I, I'm sure you would agree with it. I know we talked about it a lot. And what do you think of the of data and marketing at many? I would 100% agree. I think we've moved away from data is a nice to have to data has to be the foundation to drive everything forward. And, and I'm a huge fan of the word data informed and data viewing.

00:04:18:26 - 00:04:42:21
不明
Decision making is in moving away from just data down to date decisions and then going ahead and making sure there's solid information to support that. And that's essentially what we've been doing a lot with your tool as well is the enablement of, how is data being leveraged to amplify the understanding that we have with our customers to amplified understanding what we have of their pathways, and then apply our strategies on top of it.

00:04:42:23 - 00:05:09:27
不明
So it's been quite transformational for us. Oh, that's great to hear. Yes. So we talk about there's so many challenges to face, but luckily, we are still optimistic that we can face all these challenges. Right. If we just use the right tools for use. I if you use data, all the things you've, you've already mentioned, then we can actually go ahead and boost productivity, right, to make sure our marketing activities are actually successful.

00:05:10:00 - 00:05:32:23
不明
Even despite budget cuts. I know budgets are tight everywhere, right. Would you agree with that? What kind of tools do you think? Are very relevant nowadays? Which tools to marketers need? I would agree. I would say that more than ever, we need to be closer to the consumer, not only from, high level data perspective, such as who they are, what they buy.

00:05:32:29 - 00:05:57:08
不明
Those now are basic expectations. You need to know what they buy. You need to know where they buy and how they buy. But also understanding the what are the touchpoints that they tend to engage with. Customers are the channels they come to you to talk to us and then tailor their their navigation tailored, their own customized, really and the approach so that they feel even though it's a mass production, opportunity strategy, they're feeling individualized.

00:05:57:09 - 00:06:16:21
不明
They feel like they're receiving special love or special treatment. And that's when the innovative approaches come to mind when I come to reply, because it's no longer just enough to leverage what we know of. For example, that has been, you know, used for the last six, six, six, seven, ten years. Yeah. It's really about how, how is NMM being applied.

00:06:16:22 - 00:06:45:23
不明
What are the other elements that I miss being augmented with such as AI. And what are the modeling really the foundation of the models being created. And the really interesting part really closely is which attracted me to you guys, as well as the fact that, the way the model was being built and created not only in partnership with FAS, but it also uses a much more advanced approach and which even internally, has required some educational effort for us because people were just not necessarily, super familiar because it's very advanced.

00:06:45:23 - 00:07:09:16
不明
So this is exciting. Although we need it's the no longer expecting the basic get together and blow it up with, you know, AI and everything else available these days. Yeah, yeah. We need innovative approaches. Right. What we used to do doesn't work anymore. When you think about how traditional workflows look like, when we look at traditional workflows to to measure marketing success, there are often quite, convoluted, right?

00:07:09:16 - 00:07:32:15
不明
They're quite complex. If a marketer has a question, for example, what's the ROI for this cross-selling campaign that I did, for shoes, for customers who usually just buy, let's say, handbags. Then you have to answer such a question. The marketer has to go to the data science team. The request goes to some kind of backlog because obviously teams are busy.

00:07:32:15 - 00:07:49:17
不明
They have so much other requests as well. So it takes a while for them to actually go ahead and do something about requests. They have to gather the data manually. They have to manually build a model, train a model, iterate on it, and then once they have an output, they can deliver it up to the marketer and marketer can take the output to take a decision.

00:07:49:19 - 00:08:14:13
不明
But from the start of that initial request to the answer, there's a lot of time that passes right? And so by the time that the marketer actually gets the answers that they were looking for, the campaign might already be over. Might maybe the next campaign has already started. So the answers that they were looking for to actually improve and to optimize comes too late.

00:08:14:16 - 00:08:43:22
不明
And this is also why we at Adobe, created Adobe Mix Modeler, right? This workflow was just not good enough anymore. It doesn't deliver meaningful insult in that, results in a timely manner. So we built a tool, Adobe Mix Modeler. That enables marketers to measure incremental impact of marketing activities and optimize planning, holistically, across all channels, paid, earned, and you name it, wherever you are.

00:08:43:24 - 00:09:17:20
不明
And with this tool, we are really we are disrupting the measurement space. We are bringing AI powered measurement and planning together in an interface that was purpose built for marketers. And I really mean we are disrupting this space because we have automated so much of the process of this workflow that I've showed before, from data gathering, and data harmonization to model prep, to exploring different scenarios, to taking decisions on budget allocation, campaign execution and measurement and to optimize post-quantum reviews.

00:09:17:27 - 00:09:45:08
不明
So there's a lot of goodness that we bring together. We automate and make sure that you save a lot of time. Right. So you get results. Not in months or even years. You get your results really when you need them in the in a very timely manner. And how we do it is by our unified methodology that measures incrementality at both touchpoint and aggregate level, while we're also ensuring fully consistent results with it.

00:09:45:11 - 00:10:09:21
不明
So, the tool is built on, Adobe Experience platform where there's a lot of different applications as well. But we're using that same platform. And we're making sure that it is future proofed by also measure each channel at the most best available granularity. We are taking data from all across the place. Right? From online, from offline.

00:10:09:28 - 00:10:37:03
不明
We have customers bringing in data from online channels like, Meta or Google from connected TV, but also from offline channels like radio, direct mail, linear TV, you name it, whatever you think, you can bring it, you can measure it. And we're making sure that everything is actionable, right? That you have the data available at the right time to then take this to, improve your decisioning.

00:10:37:05 - 00:11:03:08
不明
How does it work? What does it look like a little bit under the hood? So we have created, proprietary and patent pending, methodology g technology based on the needs of our own Adobe marketing team. So we are also our own best customer, let's say. And how it works is you bring in your data both on an aggregate level or an event level, so you can choose to bring, in summary level or event level data.

00:11:03:08 - 00:11:40:12
不明
It's up to you. If you bring in either or both, you can bring in data from paid channels, from owned channels. And also very important, you can bring in data that is, just checked into your activities. Right. So internal factors like sales data, HR data or you can bring in also external factors like the stock index or industry trends, this kind of information and all of this aggregate level data goes into marketing mix model it where, multivariate regression engine then determines the incremental impact of non event level data.

00:11:40:14 - 00:12:06:27
不明
But you can also bring in your event level data right from your walled gardens, from your website, whatever you have. And we bring it into a multi-touch attribution model where a supervised machine learning attribution engine then learns the incremental impact of event level channels by comparing all customer passion. And, we are unifying this bottom up and top down approach by using the the AI technology that we have built.

00:12:07:00 - 00:12:30:08
不明
And this means that the aggregate outputs from our marketing mix modeling model also inform the multi-touch attribution model and vice versa. What you then get as a result is, complete view of all the incremental marketing channel performance you can use this to then go ahead and plan for your activities. Right. You can develop you can compare multiple of plans to make.

00:12:30:08 - 00:12:54:17
不明
Then sure you take the right decisions and you can take insight optimizations because you have everything available, in real time. Or I mean, as soon as you bring in the information and, run your models, run your plans, you can use that data then to take the right decisions to optimize campaigns that are still running. And obviously everything that comes in the future.

00:12:54:19 - 00:13:10:05
不明
So there's a lot of good things you can do with it. And I know that Mike, of course, has already started doing a lot of these good things. So, I'm very happy to have many here today. And, you can talk a little bit maybe about all the great results you had so far, all the experiences you had.

00:13:10:12 - 00:13:42:13
不明
And just walk us a little bit through your journey so far. So it's been a very interesting yet rewarding journey we've created, we leverage all of this magic you've described on this screen and done. I think the the first outputs, after 80 plus iterations, to again get really closer to what's the best iteration, what's the best acceptable rate and etc. it has been really rewarding and getting us to essentially as, as closer to the journey of the consumer as possible.

00:13:42:13 - 00:14:02:12
不明
So it's been quite an interesting journey. We're finally going live and I can't wait. I'm very excited, very nice. Do you want to talk us a little bit through, what you have learned so far from everything you've done? I think it falls into a couple of buckets. One of them being, what I call the shocking realities.

00:14:02:13 - 00:14:24:08
不明
And knowing and then normally requires. And a couple of weeks when we're having conversations and candy and as we're having conversations. But so it has been really eye opening from a perspective of, hey, we knew this worked. We didn't realize this channel works as much as we thought it did, so we didn't realize how we like how reliant we are on the particular journey.

00:14:24:10 - 00:14:45:28
不明
And so you had simplify that knowledge for us and then in other scenarios is kind of be more like, wait, hang on, I invest X amount of dollars in this particular case, particular channel. And this is actually something that doesn't work anymore at all. So and often, you know, hard realities, but always about realities because like any helps us do better, help us optimize better.

00:14:46:01 - 00:15:09:25
不明
But it has also helped us consolidate is what we've always thought existed, is what we call synergies. So understanding that is not looking at a channel isolation, it's channel A plus channel B, it works much closer, much stronger together. And and if you move an investment from A to a way or you put too much and B that synergy may break or, or may be damaged.

00:15:09:25 - 00:15:37:02
不明
So understanding how the synergies work is then really key for us, because they help us understand how one channel or multiple channels impact each other, and how it's important to have a balanced approach to that. I think ultimately we're not embarking. We're about thoughts and a journey of change management. So leveraging all of that information to understand, hey, moving from an outdated attribution method to you now embarking through this and it makes more of a journey.

00:15:37:02 - 00:15:59:12
不明
And soon we say touch. Journey, you requires a way to change the way we look at things and educate the audience and how what that means for us. The new data is coming along. And then hopefully leading us to skyrockets and the returns that we're hopefully you get. So very exciting times. It's been a change management journey, realization journey.

00:15:59:18 - 00:16:37:00
不明
And now embarking to the final tests in LA and then full on shortly. Yeah. So so you mentioned the change. Change process, change management. From your experience, I guess it doesn't only apply to changes you have internally, but also changes you can have with, partners you work with. Right. So could you maybe elaborate a little bit of, how this changes the way that you work with agencies and how that looks like for you today, now that you've implemented yet another tool that you're using?

00:16:37:03 - 00:16:58:08
不明
So it's actually gotten as much closer, if I could even say that, because we were already kind of close. But, the, the agency, our assist partner has been really great in person. So embark with us for an understanding how the model was built. So which which in itself turning eradication process. Because what I was saying earlier, like there's a lot of these state of things that you guys bring to the table.

00:16:58:08 - 00:17:21:14
不明
There are brand new, not only for us as a company, for the industry. So when you have to forget how things were made because there's a a much stronger best way to do it does require some educational perspective, but they've been phenomenal in embracing the educational element of it and then taking it to apply. So it has a strength from the perspective of, here's how the cookie is being made here.

00:17:21:14 - 00:17:43:23
不明
Here's the ingredients of the cake. So we've been impacting all of that in a lot of detail and lot, and then creating a roadmap not only for implementation and testing, which we have done, which again got us even closer to understanding how we're going to be doing that, but also from the perspective of the educational. So it's been huge for us that the partners in the agency understand what kind of change management is required to.

00:17:43:23 - 00:18:15:23
不明
But before we even start applying those change management that there is education approach of like, look, here's what KPI used to mean with this methodology. That's a little bit outdated. Now here's what this KPI will start to mean. We're going to do reapplying with minimum foods being in really key to partner cookies together. To your point, owning technology, but also to pretty much all partners, particularly our agency friends who are going to be, operationalizing this a little bit more closely, but also from both educational as well as application perspective, and how should their results.

00:18:15:26 - 00:18:39:24
不明
Yeah, yeah. So I mean change seems to be the constant here, in, in the conversation because I know you've already done a lot you have implemented a mixed model throughout the last year. There were changes that you've already started with, but I know you've got, more planned, more lined up. So maybe, could you walk us a little bit through what you've planned for the future?

00:18:39:24 - 00:19:18:03
不明
What changes do you still have in store? So we're going globally very shortly. So that's that's very interesting. I think, we started with North America, and now that we have a very strong foundation, we're going to be we're going to be going globally or we're going to be launching new ways and new models. And so we launched with a model A, we're going to be amplifying that remote B and which is something fun we're able to do too, as well as being able to compare the different ways of of looking to model which consequence amplifies the planning and the scenario planning.

00:19:18:05 - 00:19:45:25
不明
We are also internally revisiting what success looks like. And so I think moving away from historical potential KPI is that again, we our eyes have been a little bit more open, and will be hopefully continuously open as we refresh models, as we update models. But by consequence, that means potentially the way we're looking into historical KPIs may have to change, or we have to have a different weighting towards them.

00:19:45:28 - 00:20:11:22
不明
So this is also helping us look into what the success really look like and what should be optimizing against and so it's been quite fun. So low way of saying there is a global world domination. Yeah. So we're going to start like a mad scientist going all over the world. We're going to be building more, iterations. Even though I said a plus the beginning as we're likely going to reach double that, which is exciting.

00:20:11:25 - 00:20:34:17
不明
And we're going to be new iterations, really. And then also we are we have begun a process of, hey, who's used to be yellow? Now it's going to be green kind of kind of conversations. And it's been quite exciting. Okay. So you started out in the US, is there something you expect, to go differently in, the EMEA markets?

00:20:34:20 - 00:20:57:00
不明
Yeah. So Amia has a little bit of limitation to data due to the, the privacy laws. Right. So by consequence and we're going to have some of those challenges as live opportunities because less data means the model has to work harder. So so I'm excited for that. But I'm, I'm expecting or hoping we had some of the shocking revelations that we had here as well.

00:20:57:00 - 00:21:24:02
不明
So and if we don't have them, I need to put them in. It was going to. Oh, sorry about that. I think we're going to learn that particularly because of the more privacy rules being being a bit more aggressive. But for that, I think, yeah, we're going to have a little bit more shocking truth in the sense of what really works versus what doesn't work, because the dollars have to work ten times harder over there because we don't know, sometimes we have there's a but for the audience who's receiving it.

00:21:24:04 - 00:21:47:27
不明
So this is definitely going to help shine some light to the black hole. And then I'll keep some say and excited about seeing how the materializes for us. Cool. Thank you so much for your time. I, we're almost at the end. But I would, want you to leave our, audience maybe with a couple of, last tips and tricks.

00:21:48:00 - 00:22:18:07
不明
So, like, I'll give you one, which I personally had to overcome is, Don't be scared when things look a little bit too good to be true, or when the unknown could create some uncomfortable scenarios. So. And then quickly that, you know, they are sometimes not all unicorns and fairies. But it's best to know the reality where it's telling you, particularly in the market that we live today, when dollars you know, Mark, those have to work ten times harder for you then maybe for Fairy World, that's not essentially real.

00:22:18:10 - 00:22:38:22
不明
So accept them comfortable and live with them comfortable and more than uncomfortable to become an opportunity for you. And built from there. It's been key for us. We've had some some challenging conversations. We've had some hard conversations based on the data. But in the end, all these conversations have been fundamental for us to keep moving forward stronger than before.

00:22:38:27 - 00:22:59:04
不明
So good luck. And at LinkedIn, if you need some some extra content and help. Yeah. Thank you so much for your time. It was a pleasure having this conversation with you. And I'd say for our audience, have fun at Adobe Summit. Thanks for having me. All right. Bye, everyone.

00:22:59:06 - 00:22:59:26
不明
Who?
