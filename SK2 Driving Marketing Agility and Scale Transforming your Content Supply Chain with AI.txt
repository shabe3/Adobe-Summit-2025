00:00:00:03 - 00:00:35:26

Excited to share with you Adobe, the the Adobe Gen Studio Vision, and how we are solving and helping organizations transform their content supply chain. I want to start by setting a little bit of the backdrop. What's happening today? Hopefully so far the summit is going great for you. But if there's one thing you've taken away, it's that every organization is trying to deliver the ultimate personalized experience 1 to 1 communication with each of your incoming teamers.

00:00:35:28 - 00:01:12:22
不明
What does that mean? That means that content being consumed is increasing dramatically. Ten years ago, the amount of content consumed online for 5.5 hours today eight hours of content a day. What does that mean? That means that everybody is competing for mindshare. That means that ultimately, you've got to have the right content and enough of the right content to solve that problem.

00:01:12:24 - 00:01:41:15
不明
Some might call this the content crisis. I would say that it's an opportunity. It's an opportunity for everybody to figure out how you transform your organizations, to bring the scale so that you can deliver this content, to make our customers excited, to engage with our brand and build a deeper relationship with your brands.

00:01:41:17 - 00:01:58:04
不明
I want to start with some questions. This is what I'll tell you. We talk. I talk with a lot of customers. There's many in here that I recognize, so it's good to see your faces. And what I will tell you is there are some common questions that I get. And so you might be wondering, how might I know if I'm in this?

00:01:58:07 - 00:02:24:21
不明
Where am I at in this journey? The first is how can I create content fast enough? I might even go one step further to say, do I even know how long it takes for me to create content? I see many organizations that don't have that baseline established makes it really hard. How can I create enough of the right content?

00:02:24:23 - 00:02:54:15
不明
Or the last one if this explosion is really happening? How do I maintain brand integrity? How do I manage that? And then here's a great question that I get. What are we supposed to do with AI? I get asked this question in every single customer conversation. And what I will tell you is each of these manifest themselves across three opportunities that we see.

00:02:54:18 - 00:03:22:11
不明
The first, why transform your content supply chain? Because you've got to be able to move fast. It's not an option to not transform your content supply chain. Time doesn't stand still. Customer expectations don't. They don't wait. Which means the time is now. Don't fall behind. So speed second scale. And I'm going to talk to you more about what I mean by scale.

00:03:22:13 - 00:03:47:22
不明
But now that I'm moving faster, how do I start to scale? Because I don't know about you, but I don't see marketing budgets growing at the pace of the amount of content needed. Which means you've got to have a way to scale the last piece. Brand integrity. When everything's moving so fast. How do I make sure that brand is not compromised?

00:03:47:24 - 00:04:16:11
不明
And across each of these. What's the role that AI plays to help enable and improve each of these strengths or opportunities? And this will become the framework that we walk through throughout this presentation. I want to start first with what does it mean to drive speed or to get speed at a content supply chain? I would say, and I get this question a lot as well.

00:04:16:13 - 00:04:50:14
不明
Where do I start? Can somebody tell me, like where do I start in this content supply chain journey? I would say first and foremost, you have to start with your foundation of how you get the content built, the workflow, the metadata. What you see today is fragmented teams, fragmented data, fragmented processes, fragmented tools. And I would argue, fragmented content supply chain between each of you and your agencies.

00:04:50:16 - 00:05:22:19
不明
Just because you solve the problem on your side, unless you're completely internal. You have to figure out how to work with your agencies. So what is the process? How does it work? It may surprise you, but on average, the average enterprise customer today has 99 zero martech tools that might surprise you. Now imagine taking 90 tools, layering an AI and saying, I don't understand.

00:05:22:19 - 00:05:36:29
不明
How come I don't get the results? I expect? You can't do that. It doesn't work. So I want to make sure that we land that point. You've got to build a firm foundation.

00:05:37:02 - 00:05:50:25
不明
So what's the opportunity? We're going to wave the Adobe Magic wand. I'm just kidding. It's not an Adobe Magic wand, but I will just say, how do you turn that chaos into some organization?

00:05:50:27 - 00:06:21:08
不明
And then how do you layer AI into that new way of operating? And it is a new way of operating. It's a mind shift for your organizations, and you'll see multiple areas where I can help actually drive increased efficiencies across this content supply chain. In each of your organizations, let's go to the next one. Content reuse. Quick show of hands.

00:06:21:11 - 00:06:32:20
不明
If you don't want to raise your hand, it's okay. How many of you would say that you know for a fact to what your content reuse is? Quick show of hands.

00:06:32:22 - 00:06:57:21
不明
That's exactly what I thought. The reality is, we don't know. We don't. Yet the reason that we invest in a digital asset management application, the reason we store all of our content and our metadata is because, well, aren't we supposed to reuse it? Yes you are. Why do we not know? Because we have a fragmented content supply chain.

00:06:57:23 - 00:07:04:16
不明
So let's stitch it together. Let's fix that.

00:07:04:18 - 00:07:23:24
不明
There we go. So let me give you an let me give you an example. What does it look like if I'm going to not think about reuse at the end of my content supply chain? I'm going to build from the beginning in terms of reuse by design. So many of you, when you look at this upper, you're like, it's an email, Brant.

00:07:23:24 - 00:07:53:12
不明
Big deal. And you're right. It's an email. But what if I told you that instead of the email, you turned this into six different experience blocks that you tagged appropriately, you stored in your asset repo so that at the end of the day, you could actually take the same content and turn it into multiple experiences and start to mix and match content.

00:07:53:14 - 00:08:29:15
不明
So now, instead of just an email, you're delivering multiple experiences. And then when you layer AI onto that, imagine the opportunities. They're endless. So this is the new world of getting scale across your businesses in terms of delivering those personalized experiences. The last one I'm going to talk about his brand. How do I maintain brand integrity. So you'll see some of the stats 70% of team members need to produce more content.

00:08:29:18 - 00:08:55:23
不明
How about the stat on the far right? 85%. Does it say 85%? Use the corporate approved tools? Nope. Doesn't they turn to do it yourself? Tools. How do you maintain brand integrity when 85% turn to do it yourself? Tools. Why do they turn to do it yourself? Tools? Because it's not easy for them to create content on their own.

00:08:55:25 - 00:09:26:24
不明
We would argue you should democratize creativity. Everybody's a content creator. That's another way to drive scale. How do you do that? Glad you asked. Ultimately, you want to start to think about building hero images. You saw this from David's presentation today on the main stage. Composable content building or brand guardrails. Building those templates. And then let's not forget let's add AI into that.

00:09:26:26 - 00:09:46:04
不明
Think about automated brand checks. Think about automated approvals. Like imagine how you start to get an idea of not just how you maintain brand, but how you. Then you also layer in the AI capabilities to bring scale.

00:09:46:07 - 00:10:12:12
不明
Good news. Adobe Gen Studio transforms your content supply chain. Hopefully, if there's one message you heard from the main stage today, it's that Adobe Gen Studio helps you transform your content supply chain. We are incredibly excited and are heavily invested in Adobe Gen Studio, and I will tell you that I don't have the stats and it was too late for me to go figure out the stats, because I thought about it when I was backstage.

00:10:12:13 - 00:10:47:09
不明
But I will tell you that many organizations, I would surmise probably 75% of the organizations ultimately want they want to transform. They they want to use the Gen Studio solution. But it's hard to move away from legacy tools. And so what ends up happening is they buy a bunch of point solutions, and then they have really, really good tech partners that stitch all these point solutions together.

00:10:47:11 - 00:11:15:29
不明
This doesn't resonate with anybody, does it? No. Okay. So what I will tell you is there is value to an integrated solution. What's the value? Unified metadata. I'm sure folks are like, it's about time. Adobe. How about we unify the metadata across content supply chain? Good news. And hopefully you saw it on the main stage. You're going to see it here today with the demo number two unified Review and Approval.

00:11:16:01 - 00:11:58:02
不明
How come I can't open, express and initiate an approval that's running on the same approval flow that I've built in work front? How come I can't launch an approval flow inside of Gen Studio for for performance marketing that I've already built inside of work front? Good news. You can. That's a huge win. Unified brand service. Imagine setting up a brand one time and then having that instantiate across multiple applications so that you know you're on brand and you don't have to worry about setting it up multiple times or relying on your brand standards that are held in a shared drive somewhere that only the brand team probably goes and checks, right.

00:11:58:05 - 00:12:12:16
不明
You'll see several others in there. Unified experiences are the reason. It's the secret sauce to why Adobe Gen Studio is the answer.

00:12:12:18 - 00:12:34:15
不明
So what's Adobe's definition of content supply chain? It breaks into five pillars. You'll see this throughout the presentation. It's the way that we'll go through the demos as well. These five pillars now break into I'm going to break down a little bit of the visual that you saw from David on Main Stage today. It breaks into 4 or 5 pillars and there's a set of applications that sit in each pillar.

00:12:34:17 - 00:12:50:03
不明
These applications right here are what we would call the core applications that build the foundation for content supply chain. This is that set of applications.

00:12:50:05 - 00:13:10:22
不明
There's the Gen Studio Foundation. I'm sure there's questions. Gen Studio Foundation is a unifying UI that as you start to build more and more content, you don't require your users to have to go into work front to get something into them, to get something into content analytics, to get something. Can't I have one place where I can start to see some of this stuff?

00:13:10:24 - 00:13:40:20
不明
Yes, that is the Gen Studio Foundation and that is very early. Right now. We're in very early days, but we're very excited about what that's going to unlock. Last but not least are the modules that layer in these become additive. They are built on top of the core applications. They leverage the capabilities of the core applications. However, in and of themselves, they inherently have value as well for specific personas.

00:13:40:22 - 00:14:02:06
不明
And then the good news this is all built upon Adobe's AI platform. And it's built upon ADP from a data standpoint, so that you can have metadata that actually goes from the building of the content, and it moves to the delivery of the content, so that I can actually run performance against that metadata.

00:14:02:09 - 00:14:21:11
不明
There's also the A framework you saw today specifically, I want to point out to the workflow optimization agent and the content production agent. These are the two agents that will engage around the content supply chain. And you'll see some of this a little bit later.

00:14:21:13 - 00:14:49:19
不明
Let's go back to the three. These are the three value drivers if you will. And let's talk about customers who have realized value Pfizer. Pfizer actually after their transformation of their content supply chain. Pfizer actually drove a 50% reduction in the speed at which they were able to get content to market. I will also tell you, they launched ten brand websites in two months.

00:14:49:21 - 00:15:18:18
不明
Two months. And if you think about Pfizer, that's a that's a huge, huge feat because as they get their drug approvals done, they need to be able to get that drug to market quickly. Let's talk about Cox Communications in terms of thinking about reuse by design. The use of Am assets Am sites. They were able to double the sales through their digital channels and bring the scale to their organization.

00:15:18:21 - 00:15:45:21
不明
And last but not least, Red hat. David talked about Red hat today. I will tell you that they were able to scale with the use of Express Creative Cloud Enterprise. They were able to quickly roll out brand templates that help them move ten times faster and delivering content to their end. Customers. Now, this is my favorite part. So we're going to bring an actual customer out.

00:15:45:23 - 00:16:08:18
不明
So great news. We actually are going to bring out Prudential. So what I will tell you Prudential this year is celebrating their 150th year. And when you think about 150 years for a brand, that's a long time. And yet they're up here to share their story and their journey of how they've transform their content supply chain. So we're going to run a quick video and I'm going to introduce them to the stage.

00:16:08:19 - 00:16:42:08
不明
Thanks. Imagine a world before the telephone connected us and before electricity lit our homes. Well, we were there. We were there with a mission to provide life insurance to working families when no one else would. We were there when change happened. Our world came under threat and our customers needed a rock they could rely on. And as we turn 150, we were still guided by our purpose.

00:16:42:11 - 00:17:22:05
不明
We are here to expand financial access. We're talking about empowering our people to protect our own legacies, increase opportunities. You got me yesterday. Yesterday. But this is a new tomorrow. Embrace innovation and help make a difference across the globe. And just like when we were founded, we'll be here to meet society's greatest needs. Because as people live longer than ever before, will ensure retirement isn't just something we survive in, but thrive in, so that everyone can live a better life longer.

00:17:22:08 - 00:17:54:29
不明
We're prudential here, then here, now here. Tomorrow. But you. This is our time. Please join me in welcoming Greg Klein and Bridget Esposito to the stage.

00:17:55:01 - 00:18:24:01
不明
150 years. Yeah, that's a long time. So how does a brand maintain relevance 150 years? So, yes, 150 years. Huge. I would say three key things are really most important for 150 years. But I could speak to you more about what I know about Prudential. Number one, building the right products at the right time and serving all of our customers.

00:18:24:03 - 00:18:49:26
不明
Number two, empowering exceptional people at Prudential and giving them autonomy so that they can go move things forward. And the last one I would say is the the the biggest thing where we don't say things are just good enough. You know, with your kids, you it's, it's good enough that, we are not that type of culture at all.

00:18:50:07 - 00:19:17:15
不明
We want more. And, you know, we expect that from all of our employees just to ground us just a little bit. Just to give you a little bit of a background on Prudential. We are leader, obviously, in insurance and financial services. We have 50 million customers, 1.5 trillion in assets under management. We have a marketing staff of about 365 plus people, and we serve many business units.

00:19:17:28 - 00:19:43:08
不明
So we have five CMAs, all representing different businesses, a Prudential. My role and our team's role is to build out a more tech stack that is empowering all marketers. All CMO is, of course, prudential to do modern marketing and build growth within the business. We work with all of the CMOs. We work with the creative team, which is led by Bridget.

00:19:43:17 - 00:20:04:29
不明
And it's really all about growth. Perfect. So, Bridget, I love how bright and shiny you are. It's so much fun. You make this so much fun. What role does the creative team play? Like, help me understand the dynamics there and then the role that creative team plays in driving the strategy in this transformation? Yeah, absolutely.

00:20:04:29 - 00:20:30:20
不明
So our team is made up of a very typical creative team, right. Creative directors, art directors, copywriters, producers. And through all of that, we really work closely shoulder to shoulder with our business partners and our clients to really drive those business objectives. And then from that point on, we're looking at who we are and how we can surprise and delight through the brand.

00:20:30:25 - 00:20:56:13
不明
We work on everything from, from social experiences to live experience and sponsorships and that top of the funnel house work. So it's a lot of work that needs to be done. Recently went through some org changes last year, which I know a lot of you probably feel in the audience. And we looked at as a chance to reinvent ourselves, looked at a chance to say, how can we do more, create more, be more for our brand, be more for our people?

00:20:56:15 - 00:21:16:04
不明
And we looked and said, we also have the opportunity to be a leading brand in AI and financial services. And that was really exciting to us. Now we can't do that and build that and relook at that without being really close partners with our martech team. And a little shout out to Terry Chou, who I'm looking at right there.

00:21:16:07 - 00:21:33:02
不明
That's my guy. He is our dedicated martech from a creative perspective. And I have to tell you, like, we have a long relationship and we still push on each other and he doesn't always give me what I want, but it's such a good conversation all the time. You have to be honest about what you need. The goals have to match up.

00:21:33:04 - 00:21:56:24
不明
You've got to speak each other's love language, and when you do that, really amazing stuff starts to happen. And I think as we went down and looked at what's the changing landscape for us? Working closely with the partners we discussed, it's not just the tech that we're adopting, it's how we're doing it. So we had to have some serious conversations with our creatives of like the evolution of the role of what we play.

00:21:56:27 - 00:22:15:20
不明
We now we're kind of changing into that space where we've coming big ideas and curators as opposed to just production. And that's a big leap. And so we had to do a lot of education in that space and help, inform on decision making and empower people so that we could get the high end, the decisive content we need.

00:22:15:22 - 00:22:42:04
不明
And then from there, we also encourage everybody to be feel empowered and bring ideas to the table. What are trends you're seeing? What's going to make our processes easier and work with our martech team to bring that to life? Fantastic. So obviously there's a lot of interest in AI. Yes. Right. And part of I'm sure you were really dialed in when you were in the back with me talking, but part of this conversation has been like, what do we do with AI?

00:22:42:06 - 00:23:05:27
不明
And did you just flip a switch? And I just work like, what was the journey and how did you go about that journey? So, I would say a few years ago, probably 3 or 4 years ago, with Covid, everybody experienced, experience that we were in, you know, a world of hurt from a content standpoint. And I know, Brant, you just spoke about that in your opening remarks.

00:23:06:06 - 00:23:37:26
不明
We were being asked to do a lot more with less people. And we, you know, we made a decision at that point that we had to rationalize our martech stack. At that point, we did decide to go pretty large with Adobe as our base platform. And what we did is we layered in other AI solutions, as well as Adobe's AI solutions to really drive efficiency and be able to do more, more with less.

00:23:38:18 - 00:24:15:10
不明
The results have been amazing. So if you look at what we've accomplished in a pretty short period of time, the first thing is our more tech stack, which was really pretty disjointed. Again, I mentioned to you about the five different business lines. A lot of people did a look, did kind of what they wanted to. And what we did is we we formed a standardized platform which led to 25% less, more tech vendors, pretty much disconnected vendors as part of the stack that set the foundation for us to go drive with the new innovative technology.

00:24:15:13 - 00:24:40:04
不明
So we've rolled out AI across many different things, whether it's creative copy, more looking at compliance, and other tools, all marketers, all 365 people that I spoke to about all have access to AI tools today. Which was a tremendous feat this past year. And we're seeing great results 3 to 4 times faster image editing thanks to things like Firefly.

00:24:40:16 - 00:25:09:07
不明
90% of marketers say that they're saving 25% of their time. A lot of these people were very, very fearful of introducing AI early on. Those same people are now the biggest promoters of our AI solution. It's been a total turnaround. 70%, faster first draft. We're not taking the human out of the creation process, but it's assisting them.

00:25:09:16 - 00:25:35:01
不明
And the amazing thing is, when you take these tools, whether it's an AI tool, whether it's personalization capabilities that you spoke about and creating different variants of content, we're seeing huge lifts of engagement. So you could see this one stat 135% engagement. When we combine AI with personality personalization capabilities. So that's just some stats. I could throw a lot more out there.

00:25:35:01 - 00:26:02:25
不明
But but we've really you know, we've seen huge, huge inroads. Yeah those are some great stats. Super impressive. So Bridget help me understand like maintaining brand integrity. Yeah. And going through that transformation. How did like, how did you do that? How did you enable everybody inside of the organization to stay on brand but unlock creativity? Yeah. So that's definitely a group effort for sure.

00:26:02:28 - 00:26:29:06
不明
Is so important that you set and maintain what your choices are around AI and integrate them into your everyday brand guidelines. So you've got to figure out ethically what is okay for a brand, what makes sense? What are we okay with pushing and not pushing? You need to make those decisions as a group. And then make sure you get them in writing and that you publicize and you share it out and educate so that you really defining that view.

00:26:29:09 - 00:26:51:06
不明
And we did that through a group of us creative martech legal, and also our strategy partners, a small group at first and then got buy in throughout everywhere. And that really helped us kind of set the stage, then incorporate it and make it part of everyday brand decision making process. And it varies, right? It's not like you set it in stone and that's it.

00:26:51:06 - 00:27:10:12
不明
And it's never you're going to have use cases that come up on a regular basis. We're you're going to need that same, crew of people to help make a decision of, like, is this it? Because it's AI is not black and white. There's a lot of gray area that we need to tend to. So a really good example of that and how we saw that come into play was a tool called Flash Forward.

00:27:10:14 - 00:27:38:27
不明
We recently developed it about a year ago, and it is a multi-sensory AI tool that helps our clientele see themselves in the future so they can see themselves thriving. And when we looked at this, it was really someone's taking their photo. We're engaging it, and then we're creating a story that makes them the hero. And in that process, we took it to the Aspen Ideas Festival, where we got immediate feedback that they it wasn't as authentic as they need it to be.

00:27:38:27 - 00:27:55:19
不明
People weren't seeing themselves. There was some bias that was happening that we needed to attend to. Now, had we not set our standards up and really set the stage for what we expect, we probably would have had a lot of trouble of deciding and deciding on what to do, and also getting buy in to the extra time in development we needed.

00:27:55:22 - 00:28:15:22
不明
So the way that we approach this is that we continue to train our model. We got buy in from the senior leadership. We continue to do the prompt development that helped us kind of work through, some of the conscious inclusion. We then added human interaction, which was super important because we had someone moderating at the end making the decisions and really put those checkpoints force them in there.

00:28:15:24 - 00:28:33:29
不明
And when we did these things, we were seeing, we've seen so much improvement. And the key is that we haven't stopped iterating. We continue every time we use the tool, we continue to develop it. Yeah. And I just wanted to add so on top of everything Bridget just said, I just wanted to put the technology lens on it a little bit as well.

00:28:34:02 - 00:28:57:11
不明
So I mentioned we've we partnered obviously, you know, with Adobe as well as some other, partners out there. On the AI front, selection of these tools is very, very key, to getting the most out of out of AI. So looking at things like buying versus building. We've had a lot of conversations about that around that, and we've done some buys and some builds.

00:28:57:13 - 00:29:28:08
不明
Open LMS versus closed LMS. Indemnification for imagery, which obviously Firefly is is provided to us, which is huge. So being a regulated company, being 150 year old company, we have to be careful about those decisions. And that all comes into play. You know, as well. So we talked about protecting the brand. Like how do you how do you approach that across your like individual teams.

00:29:28:14 - 00:29:51:09
不明
Right. Like how do we talk a little bit. We talked earlier just about democratizing creativity. Yeah. How do you unlock the teams to now take what you've built the guardrails you've put it. How do you how do you unlock that for the rest of the organization? So you have to recognize that this is a process, right? You are not going to find all the solutions right out the gate.

00:29:51:09 - 00:30:13:01
不明
You're not going to get the tool and be like, well, I and released to the wild, right? There's a lot of evolution in the process and identifying what are the right use cases. Who are the people that can be using it? And then you're going to fail. I sorry to say that you're going to fail at first. There going to be some really easy ones and then there's going to be some difficult ones, but you have to push through it and it's worth it.

00:30:13:02 - 00:30:41:23
不明
So one of the first areas that we recognize as a way to improve was our brand consistency amongst organic creative. It's the wild, wild West out there, right? And we love that our our people are all taking initiative, empowered to do and say and put their thought leadership out there. But we needed that brand consistency. So we actually accessed and used Adobe Express to create templates where it was easier for them to access and put their own thoughts in there and their own words, but in our tone and in our, and in our template.

00:30:41:23 - 00:31:00:01
不明
And so we saw a huge, a huge uplift in proper content online, which made me happy. And then I think the other space that we looked at too was the custom models. So we went through a big brand refresh, about eight months ago. And one of the key items for that is that we had illustrations that were updated.

00:31:00:03 - 00:31:23:11
不明
Well, you know, it is once you have all the stuff out into the well, into the world, there's a lot of things you've got to go back and fix. So we used the, Firefly model to train it on the illustrations, and then we're able to show how you can take one of the current illustrations, like on Procom or in our space, and then use it as a style guide, and then it would apply it right in our Firefly model to output the on brand content, an illustration.

00:31:23:11 - 00:31:41:02
不明
And we saved a lot of time doing that. And I would say the key to this is when you're looking at things that are easier versus harder, you also want to understand your audience. We needed to do a lot of training around this. You can't just create these tools in these templates and just let them out. You need to know which audience you're creating it for and what level of education do they need, right?

00:31:41:09 - 00:32:01:19
不明
For instance, custom models only went out to our creatives and our partners and UX, and in that space they understand what what constitutes great creative. We're good. The others need more training. So you have to make sure that you're taking the time to give the proper training so people understand what to look for, what's wrong, what's great because there is a little bit of a brand risk at that as well.

00:32:01:21 - 00:32:19:04
不明
So you got to do all the proper work around it. So as you think about the future now, I'm not going to say what is the next 150 years look like, because I don't think any of us will be around you. Speak for yourself, sir. Oh, sorry. Well, maybe you figured something out. I won't be, I won't be, yeah.

00:32:19:07 - 00:32:48:14
不明
So he's not going to make it? Don't know. Works with me every day. So what is the what's the future like? You obviously, you talk about just this notion of, like, never settling. Always reinventing. What does that mean for Prudential? Yeah. Well, everybody saw the keynote this morning about everything happening from an AI perspective. Things are happening so, so quickly.

00:32:49:05 - 00:33:12:20
不明
It's hard to keep track. That's why the hardest part right now. My belief is by 2030 that at least 50% of marketing will be augmented between humans and agents. So you heard a lot about agents with Adobe. There's just a everybody's going to hear the term agenda for the next year, probably every day of their life.

00:33:13:03 - 00:33:40:12
不明
But it's happening. It is happening. And, I'm not saying that while 50% of of tasks in marketing in general will be augmented. I'm not saying that it's going to be smaller marketing teams. I'm saying we're going to be doing a lot, a lot more with personalization, with variants of content strategy. So again, it's it's not a matter of replacing.

00:33:40:19 - 00:34:07:11
不明
It's a matter of augmenting. And we have to see where all that goes, obviously. So we are definitely looking into that. We're also looking at, other things around workflow, for instance, publishing certain things in an automatic way. Campaign manager, program management, all with AI. And you'll see some of that once we finish up here with with a quick demo of Gen Studio.

00:34:07:21 - 00:34:34:06
不明
Things like Digital Twins. That's a newer concept now, but it's going to give us the ability to create twins of individuals of segments and so forth, where we could test things instantaneously. We could personalize things instantaneously. So there's again, a ton going on there. And we're looking at that. But the the probably the biggest key element is to get the data right.

00:34:34:12 - 00:34:59:06
不明
So again, even during the keynote again this morning, we spoke. It was spoken about with with AP, CDP getting that information right and connecting not only marketing information, but connecting the holistic view of the customer or prospect. So whether it's marketing, sales, service, really getting the complete picture of the customer so that we could go do our job.

00:34:59:14 - 00:35:21:14
不明
So a huge focus will be there. And there are AI solutions also to assist with that. Fantastic. So I'll go ahead. Yes. And I was going to go one more time. Yeah. So I mean, in closing, for me at least, I wanted to leave you all with three key things. One, which is why we are where we are today.

00:35:22:07 - 00:35:47:11
不明
Senior leadership. For all of you that want to go and embark in an AI journey. Like we have done or or in the middle of that executive approval and executive buy in is huge. A few years ago, we really pushed that. We educated funding everything in between, a lot of heartbreaking conversations, a lot of going back and forth.

00:35:47:11 - 00:36:12:09
不明
But they are bought in, which makes our lives so much easier to deliver results. Number two, and I mentioned it a little bit before collaboration. And what I mean by collaboration is that people are still fearful of AI. I mentioned a bunch of different things that I will be helping us with, and augmenting. There are people that are doing some of those roles today.

00:36:12:12 - 00:36:31:06
不明
We need to involve all those people that are fearful. And like I said, it's amazing some of the turnarounds from people that said, I can't help me, I can't write like me. We need a human to start using it. And now if we shut the solution off, they'll be the first people calling to say, I need it back right?

00:36:31:12 - 00:37:00:10
不明
So again, getting people along for the ride with you is huge. And the last one, and probably the most important is don't feel the need to be perfect, right? Everything is moving so fast. If you could introduce new functionality, test it quickly, see if it works. Don't feel that everything has to be perfect out of the gate. You'll fail.

00:37:00:12 - 00:37:26:03
不明
So try new things. Try beta programs. Look at new vendors that are out there that are coming up with new innovative technology. We all need to move fast. The industry's moving fast. And if we don't, we're going to be left behind. So that would be, you know, the three things that I would just say are really important for all of you to drive your AI strategy within your marketing teams.

00:37:26:05 - 00:37:45:22
不明
Thank you. Yes. So we got a couple of minutes left. So, Bridget, if you would say parting thoughts. I got to hear Greg's parting thoughts. Like, help. You got a roomful? Probably have 35, 40,000 online. Yeah. What are the. What's the words of wisdom from a creative standpoint that you would share? Just in terms of this journey?

00:37:45:27 - 00:38:09:22
不明
Don't leave us out. We I know I'm speaking as the creative, but we are such an important part of this journey because we are your user and we see so many problems experience the pain, we go through the things and we can be a huge help in that process. And I think if we weren't as connected and they weren't as open minded and they would stay in your lane, we would be in a different situation.

00:38:09:23 - 00:38:31:25
不明
Yeah. And so I say, trust your creatives, embrace them, and if you feel like you're not having the same conversation because we speak differently. Really try to get into their seat or tell them what your goals are and try and then ask them what their goals are so that you guys can connect a little bit more. Because we do speak in a different language than marketing strategists.

00:38:32:02 - 00:38:51:02
不明
But we're learning, right? We learned to speak that. So and then I cannot say again, when the executive approval and buy in again with legal and compliance and MRU and then our all of our senior level leaders, it has been so great because we've brought them along since the beginning, and that has been the most important part.

00:38:51:04 - 00:39:12:24
不明
And we've helped our legal department understand that, you know, this is a gray area and we're learning too. And I would say really start small on different things and get them comfortable with it. That was I think, the best thing we did. We started small with different projects and then showed how it really is going to return on value and that there is less risk than they think in it.

00:39:12:26 - 00:39:27:12
不明
Awesome. On behalf of Adobe and everybody here, thank you for sharing your story. Great. Thanks for having us. Yeah.

00:39:27:14 - 00:39:46:20
不明
All right. I love that story. It's fantastic story. And you got a chance to see how pieces tie together. How do you democratize creativity? What is the journey look like? Where did they start? In their journey? So now we're going to transition and we're going to go to the demo. We're going to get a chance to show you.

00:39:46:20 - 00:40:10:09
不明
You saw some of the demo today from David and and the team. Everybody that went through from and to was incredibly excited in terms of where Adobe is making big bets to help all of you further transform your content supply chain. Here's the five building blocks again, and we're going to use this as the backdrop to start to go through the demo.

00:40:10:11 - 00:40:40:15
不明
I'm going to start start and workflow and planning three areas that I want to highlight in terms of investments work front work front planning went GA last year, and we have seen tremendous interest in terms of what work front planning unlocks and the ability to standardize your metadata so that you can have the views all the way through the content supply chain, AI powered campaign briefs.

00:40:40:18 - 00:41:02:22
不明
Wouldn't it be nice if you could take a PowerPoint or a word document and drag it in and drop it, and it will turn that into all the data you need to put into work front. That would be pretty cool. How about the workflow optimization agent? You heard us talk about our genetic strategy, and how do we have multiple areas of the application that start to complete tasks for you?

00:41:02:24 - 00:41:25:21
不明
Complete some of the more mundane capabilities or asks that all of you have. So with that, I would love to welcome Nicole Germana to the stage. Nicole, let's see this in action. Thank you Brant, and a huge thank you to Bridget and to Prudential for allowing us to use their brand in this demo to show you our latest product innovations.

00:41:25:24 - 00:41:44:16
不明
Bridget and team are gearing up for an event in Napa. And yes, I get to go. It's called Bottlerock and Prudential is rocking the rock now to centralize her campaign with everything else going on at Prudential. Bridget creates her plan. I'm going to show you how easy it is for her and her team to do this in Adobe work front planning.

00:41:44:18 - 00:42:13:20
不明
Her team can drag and drop a PDF or a PowerPoint file directly into the system, and it will start to auto populate the details as well as all of the relevant objects and records. This takes planning from a static, unstructured process into a dynamic system of record that unites data, content, and people across the campaign workflow. My tasks are auto assigned, and now I'm ready to kick off.

00:42:13:22 - 00:42:44:22
不明
So the team is telling Bridget that the project is on track. But is that actually true? Using the workflow optimization agent. Bridget can assess the schedule, scope, and resources of her project. Here I can see that we have a resourcing issue, and the agent proactively recommends a resource that has more bandwidth to accomplish this critical task. I'll accept the recommendation and the project will update automatically, checking one more time on the project's health, and we can see that we're back on track.

00:42:44:25 - 00:43:02:23
不明
Now, in addition to all of the campaigns her team is running, Bridget's team gets a ton of ad hoc requests coming in on a daily basis. She centralized all of those asks in the work front request queue. Her motto is if it's not in work front, then it doesn't exist. Now the next step in the process is content production.

00:43:02:23 - 00:43:23:03
不明
But before we go there, I'm going to turn it back over to Brant. Awesome. Thank you Nicole. So if you're excited about anything, you can clap. I just want you to know I'm not I'm not going to to clap, but I'm saying please don't hold back. So let's talk a little bit about the creation and production. These were several areas that you saw today.

00:43:23:18 - 00:43:45:08
不明
In terms of the keynote, the APIs and the advancements we're making with Firefly and the AI video capabilities that we have today, as well as express for enterprise, and how we unlock the capabilities and express to leverage some of the work front workflows, the content that exists today, the guardrails and the brand service. So we're very excited about those capabilities.

00:43:45:11 - 00:44:10:26
不明
But specifically today we're going to talk about unified review and approval. What is unified review and approval. Imagine an opportunity where like we've said you have one approval capability one approval service. You build out your workflows, and then you're able to leverage those workflows inside of express, leverage those workflows inside of Gen Studio for performance marketing. So, Nicole, let's see that work.

00:44:10:29 - 00:44:30:02
不明
Terrific. Our creatives have been hard at work, and our assets are ready to go for review and approval in work front. Priorities. I can see that I have a task that was flagged because I have an asset with a brand compliance issue here. When I log in, I can see that the logo is missing. So I'm going to update it with a brand new asset to get myself back on brand.

00:44:30:05 - 00:44:53:26
不明
Now I'm ready for review and approval. At the same time, my creative director has been reviewing my video assets and here I can see the markup as well as the comments using Frame.io. Prudential's teams as well as their stakeholders can give feedback down to the frame within a clip. Now that our creative review process is done, we're going to move to our formal approval inside of work front.

00:44:53:29 - 00:45:17:10
不明
Here I can see the status as well as the comments are updated in my master project, but it gets better. Here you get the best of both worlds with a new viewer powered by frame.io inside of work front. No need to maintain separate folders anymore and that might be worth a little applause.

00:45:17:13 - 00:45:27:19
不明
All right, so lastly, my approved assets, metadata, videos and content are all linked up in a.

00:45:27:21 - 00:45:54:20
不明
This takes us into a very streamlined campaign workflow where we are saving time. We are being more productive and reducing the time we're spending. So now I'll turn it back over to Brant. Perfect. Thanks, Nicole. So hopefully what you saw in that is that we're bringing the best of frame. We're bringing the best of work front together for a seamless experience for all asset types.

00:45:54:22 - 00:46:22:01
不明
This is a huge unlock, especially in the world of video. Huge unlock. So we're very, very excited. Let's move into asset management. The notion of reuse by design. Remember that theme Federated search. Wouldn't it be nice if I had one place to see content that lived across multiple asset repositories that is now Federated Search, that is live. Huge unlock for customers.

00:46:22:01 - 00:46:50:11
不明
Number two, content advisor. You might say what is content advisor? It was briefly in Ann's demo today. But imagine as you're building the brief, there's a window that suggests existing content that matches your brief that you could either reuse or use as inspiration in the campaign brief. And then last but not least, remember those experience blocks. Think modular content, right?

00:46:50:12 - 00:47:22:20
不明
Think modular content. Huge unlock in terms of driving scale. So Nicole let's see how this unlocks content supply chain. Terrific. All of our assets are approved, and we're ready to bring the customer experience to life. In my priorities and work front, I have a task to create my landing page. And because my bottle Rock campaign brief is attached to that task, I have all of the relevant campaign context right at my fingertips.

00:47:22:22 - 00:47:51:22
不明
Here I have all of the content that was originally attached to my brief. But again, it gets better. The content advisor not only gives me the videos and the assets I just created, but also suggest other approved assets and copy from across multiple repositories using the federated search capabilities and Experience Manager. Terrific. Let's build our page. Experience generation is here to help us, and I'm really impressed with the layout options that I have to select from.

00:47:51:24 - 00:48:17:09
不明
Our pages have been created in seconds, and I have multiple variations that I can look at and decide to use for my event, but I still remain in control using the Universal Editor. I can make changes at any time. Isn't this amazing? Back to you, Brant. It's definitely amazing and you can start to see the opportunity for those those experience blocks to go even further than just what you see in the demo.

00:48:17:10 - 00:48:38:01
不明
It's a huge unlock. So the next area we're going to combine, we're going to combine delivery and activation and reporting and insights because it helps kind of tell the collective story. So delivering an activation Gen Studio for performance marketing launched at Max, another area. We've seen a tremendous interest from all of you and all of our customer base.

00:48:38:03 - 00:49:04:13
不明
I will tell you that there are a couple of areas that we've heard from customers like, well, it's great that we can build content, but wouldn't it be nice, Adobe, if you could help us deliver that content to some of the other Adobe channels like Geo and like Marketo? It would be, and we're super excited about the unlock that we're going to be able to demo for you, as well as the additional ad platforms that we're adding to Adobe Gen Studio.

00:49:04:15 - 00:49:37:21
不明
The last piece is Content analytics. We think this is a and you saw this today as well. This is a huge unlock. And if you heard Brigitte, Brigitte made a comment. She's like, don't leave the creatives out. Imagine putting insights in the creatives hands so that as they're thinking about content, they know what's working. Instead of that being held with just the marketer, how do you democratize those insights and make them unified so that everybody understands the huge unlock?

00:49:37:23 - 00:49:59:24
不明
Let's see this. Let's see this work. Nicole. Terrific. So our event promotion page is up and running, and now it's time to drive traffic there with paid media ads as well as emails using Jen Studio for performance marketing. I have pre-built templates in a library that have been created by me, like creative professionals as well as those natively linked in Journey Optimizer as well as Marketo.

00:49:59:26 - 00:50:23:16
不明
I'm going to select this one. My brand, my persona, and my product gives me a shortcut to my creative and my brand guidelines. So now I'll select four different images from my approved bottle Rock assets that I can use during my generation.

00:50:23:19 - 00:50:44:09
不明
All right, let's see those emails. So now I'm going to have four different variations of different combinations of copy and imagery that are natively connected to the brand service. So I can see how on brand I am as well as natively connected to work around approvals. So I can easily send my emails for final approval across my teams.

00:50:44:11 - 00:50:55:11
不明
Now, when I get notified that these emails are approved, I can publish Back to Gen Studio for performance marketing to be ready to activate.

00:50:55:14 - 00:51:16:12
不明
In the Email designer in Journey Optimizer, I have access to the variations that I just created. So I'm going to select one of our emails to use for personalized and activation inside of my campaign. And the last step is for us to measure.

00:51:16:14 - 00:51:38:24
不明
In Adobe Content Analytics, I can see how my campaign is performing. I can see my marketing channel performance as well as my content analytics report, and this single view allows me to see how my images are driving visitation as well as conversions. I can see how my assets are performing for my single audience.

00:51:38:27 - 00:52:03:26
不明
And look at the thumbnails. I can see how each of them are performing in a single view. I can also click on a thumbnail to see it, as well as all the data attributes assigned to it, all powered by AI. In addition to performance insights. Now. Oh, okay. Thank you Eric. Lastly, we can share this with our team so we can send the Content Analytics report.

00:52:03:26 - 00:52:25:10
不明
Or we can export a PDF so that we can show how well our images are performing on our site, in addition to other data points like unique visitors, time spent on site and more. And there you have it. From planning to production through delivery, only, Adobe can deliver these streamlined workflows with native AI across the content supply chain.

00:52:25:13 - 00:52:33:01
不明
Back to you, Brant. Awesome. Thank you. Nicole. Yeah, let's thank Nicole.

00:52:33:03 - 00:53:04:04
不明
So I want to leave you with. I hope I hope I really do I hope you sense just the excitement that we have in terms of Adobe's investments and where we are invested to truly drive a seamless, comprehensive solution so that your end users, all of you in here, like you're making these decisions to invest in the application, and yet it's all the individuals that have to get inside of the tool and use the tool and want to work in the tool.

00:53:04:09 - 00:53:18:29
不明
I hope you see where we are investing to make that experience more seamless. This will unlock greater value on your journey to transform your content supply chain. Thank you for coming and have a good summit.
