00:00:01:10 - 00:00:05:06
不明
Haha.

00:00:05:11 - 00:00:24:53
不明
First, can I say I'm so impressed? So the people who have made it into the room. I heard you had a hell of a party last night. So and for those who are watching from there bedrooms, welcome as well. So today I want to talk about what is happening in the world of innovation, because the future is already here.

00:00:24:59 - 00:00:57:16
不明
I love this quote from William Gibson. It's important to be able to open our eyes and look across the landscape and understand what's already happening that is going to impact the future, that we're all going to be operating within. So this morning, we're going to do a little horizon scanning. And the first thing that I want to tell you is that humanity is now able to solve problems at a truly historic and exponential rate.

00:00:57:21 - 00:01:43:12
不明
It's the combination of supercomputing in conjunction with new developments like artificial intelligence. The problems that used to be completely impossible are now solvable in incredibly short periods of time. So any problem that you have in your mind now will be solved. Let me give you an example. Google recently introduced a new chip called the Willow chip. This chip is able to solve in five minutes, a problem that previously took ten septillion years for conventional computers to solve.

00:01:43:17 - 00:02:12:13
不明
Now, no one knows what that means. Nobody even knows. What do mean is ten septillion years. So I'm giving you a slide. It literally exceeds the entire history of the universe. So the traditional computational systems we have throughout the course of the history of the universe could not solve a problem that the Google Willow chip can now solve in five minutes.

00:02:12:17 - 00:02:47:17
不明
So the scale, the extraordinary pace of problem solving is happening almost faster than we can comprehend. And this is why the United States and China in particular, are racing to be able to solve problems faster than the other. It's why we're getting so much innovation. You've sure? I'm sure you've all heard about deep seek, for example, the new artificial intelligence that China introduced, which is very cheap, much cheaper than OpenAI or any of the American counterparts.

00:02:47:22 - 00:03:15:44
不明
But what really matters is not whether it's American or it's Chinese. What matters is any problem we have is now being solved at a record speed, and that opens many possibilities. It also means our understanding of reality may be off. So for example, we talk about computer chips. Well, China's just introduced a new kind of chip called changing lanes.

00:03:15:44 - 00:03:47:35
不明
You probably haven't even heard about it where they're engineering these chips at the level of atoms. This is completely changing the capacity of chips to solve problems. Or another one is a chip called the Majorana. What does it really mean in practical terms? The inventors behind it say, now we can literally begin to paint with atoms. We can begin to build atom by atom by atom.

00:03:47:40 - 00:04:10:32
不明
Now, that may sound very far from your day to day job. So let me explain why this matters to all of us. Number one, this is a revolution in the history of humanity because normally we had to start with a material, say, a tree, and then turn it into what we needed, like a boat or a desk or a chair.

00:04:10:37 - 00:04:44:55
不明
But today, because we can begin with the need, and now we can build a material atom by atom by atom. Suddenly we're able to create new materials that never existed before. So Google, for example, through this process, has already said they have found 2 million new crystals that never existed before. 380,000 new materials that we've never seen. What are people going to do with these crystals of these materials?

00:04:44:59 - 00:05:14:06
不明
I think they're going to build things. They're going to build extraordinary things. They're also doing the exact same thing with genes and life itself. We are creating on a scale and solving problems, improving health outcomes. Able to take life itself and create better ways of living. Already the Nobel Prize has been awarded for this just this last year.

00:05:14:11 - 00:05:39:40
不明
The ability to use these computational processes to solve the problem of how two proteins work. So that's already done. So let me go a little further. So you really understand what we're talking about. The future is more and more going to be 3D printed. And I mean you yourself will also be 3D printed because of the processes I'm talking about.

00:05:39:44 - 00:06:05:20
不明
I don't know if you've noticed, but HP for example, right. We think they produce printers. They print paper. Right? We've all everybody's used a 3D printer, an HP printer. Well today they are able to take your stem cells and turn it into tissue. So if you're a burn victim they can 3D print right on to you. A graph made from your own tissues.

00:06:05:25 - 00:06:33:58
不明
I used to think that when Silicon Valley talked about longevity, they meant taking a new set of vitamins or a different sleep protocol. Today, what they mean is when your organs start to fail, we'll just 3D print from your own stem cells. This is a revolution in the course of human history. These are miracles that are literally happening before our eyes.

00:06:34:02 - 00:06:59:11
不明
So now, if we open our mind to the fact that there are miracles happening daily, but they're happening so fast and they seem so technical, it's really hard to keep up. So I'm going to try and explain to you, from the point of view of an economist, what's happening on the landscape that is making the future so interesting, so exciting, and so full of opportunity for everyone.

00:06:59:16 - 00:07:23:26
不明
First is humanity is reaching to the boundaries of what is known. We are literally moving into space as one example. Now a lot of people say, isn't this just like joyriding by, you know, billionaires like Jeff Bezos or Richard Branson? I mean, don't we have enough problems here on Earth? Why are we bothering to go all the way into space?

00:07:23:31 - 00:07:56:40
不明
Well, the answer is because space holds the possibility of true abundance for humanity. As an example, the idea that we may be able to get unlimited energy from space. China is currently building this massive array of panels on satellites, where they catch the sun's rays and convert them into radio waves, beam them back to Earth safely, and suddenly you can have unlimited power in any energy grid anywhere in the world.

00:07:56:45 - 00:08:23:38
不明
They're calling it the Three Gorges Dam of space, meaning this massive power project. Now, I've spoken to people both in NASA and the European Space Agency and they'll say, well, technically, yes, but it will be very expensive. It's going to take a long time. Not sure we'll get there. There are other ways of doing this, but China is powering ahead because they don't have energy resources.

00:08:23:38 - 00:08:51:07
不明
They have coal. There's huge thing they're building is a signal of what our future holds. So I want you to now think of a world where you start to have under limited energy, true energy abundance. And if it doesn't work, then all these same scientists are saying, by the way, we've also learned how to put a hole in the ground and pull geothermal energy right out of Earth.

00:08:51:12 - 00:09:11:55
不明
I don't know if any of you spent any time in Scandinavia. My family are Scandinavian. All of the houses in Scandinavia are powered by putting a hole in the ground and pulling the heat straight out of the earth. So there are complex and simple ways, but what it all amounts to is we won't have to worry about energy in the future the way we have in the past.

00:09:11:59 - 00:09:39:34
不明
Let me leap to something else that sounds totally science fiction, but is actually happening, and that is today. If you want an iPhone or a fighter jet or a supercomputer, we have to rip up Earth and pull things out of the ground for that to happen. But we've discovered now how to mine asteroids, how to pull those same materials out of things that don't involve ripping Earth up anymore.

00:09:39:39 - 00:10:12:32
不明
In fact, there's one asteroid that's worth googling if you haven't heard of it called psyche. They say that the value of psyche, because it contains so much lithium and iron ore and cobalt and gold, things that are valuable here on Earth, that if you took the value of everything on psyche, it amounts to the annual GDP of Earth multiplied by 7 or 8 times its unbelievable wealth, but done in a way that maybe doesn't have to hurt Earth anymore.

00:10:12:34 - 00:10:33:40
不明
So I want you to now think not just unlimited energy, but unlimited resources. It's one of the things that's spurring a race to the moon, and we are surely in a massive race between the superpowers to get to the moon first. One of the reasons is we're starting to build stars on Earth. What do I mean by that?

00:10:33:44 - 00:11:04:17
不明
I mean nuclear fusion. Now, to do nuclear fusion, which everybody's talking about, is the new frontier of nuclear physics. You need helium three. And where do we find the largest supply of helium three? Not on Earth, but on the moon. Now, to pull all these resources back to Earth, we have to start thinking about what is already under construction, which is a world where we are going to be mining for refining and manufacturing in orbit on the lunar surface.

00:11:04:29 - 00:11:35:19
不明
Or if Elon Musk has his way on Mars as well. Now, that may sound so far away, but actually, the first private mining mission to an asteroid launches in about three years. And we've already had the first SpaceX factory go up and come back. There was a California company called Varta. Now, what are we making in space? A lot of things that we also make on Earth, which is why all of the businesses that are affected by this need to be paying attention.

00:11:35:23 - 00:12:01:35
不明
So on the International Space Station, we already have all the big pharma companies have projects making pharmaceuticals. And you're like, wait, what? Why are we making pharmaceuticals in orbit? In space? Well, it turns out zero gravity is a phenomenal thing. And certain ingredients will bind in zero gravity. That won't bind. And gravity. So suddenly a whole new class of drugs can be invented.

00:12:01:40 - 00:12:27:19
不明
Protein. Meat that is constructed in that environment. Very different human organs. You don't need a skeleton to start producing human organs because you 3D print them in that environment. Fiber optic cables, for example. If you make them on Earth with gravity, they get little bubbles in them. Slows down the speed of the transmission of data. But if you make them in zero gravity, no bubbles.

00:12:27:19 - 00:13:03:20
不明
Super fast data transmission. All this is beginning to encourage manufacturing. Precision manufacturing in augmented and virtual reality environments, because you don't get a second chance with space or if you're going to make something. It better work because you're not going to get up there again. And so there are massive advances happening in virtual and augmented reality manufacturing, which means the quality of precision engineer is massively improving.

00:13:03:25 - 00:13:37:37
不明
So I want you to stop thinking about space as a place where astronauts are. Even though we've had the wonderful recovery of our astronauts just in the last day or so, more and more space is about robotics. It's about autonomous instruments. It is about expanding the possibility of manufacturing and what is required for an Earth economy. Now, to make all that happen, something is underway that has, again, a huge impact on the world economy.

00:13:37:42 - 00:14:05:40
不明
And that is we are building not just an internet that envelops all of Earth, but one that is interplanetary. This matters because every square inch of Earth is worth more if you can work from anywhere. And because mega constellations of satellites are now in existence, we now rely on them like Starlink as an example. But China is building them.

00:14:05:50 - 00:14:37:19
不明
Even small countries like Rwanda are starting to build mega constellations of satellites. So this whole issue, for example, in the United States, that we don't have great internet connections in certain part of the country, it's over. We're going to have world class internet covering every square inch of Earth. What will that do that will lift the value of every square inch on Earth, and make it much easier to track what is happening to the Earth economy.

00:14:37:24 - 00:15:04:34
不明
So I want you for a moment to imagine that you personally have been given a pair of incredible prosthetics. One is the James Webb Telescope, which is now about 1.5 million miles away. And your eyes can now see what is at the far reaches of the universe, because you've been given almost like a pair of glasses. And that's how we should think about it.

00:15:04:38 - 00:15:31:43
不明
At the other end, you may not have heard of the Titan, Chris, but it's a, in opposition to a telescope. It's a microscope. We're able to see deep into the subatomic structure, the subcellular structure of reality, to be able to solve problems at that level as well. So what does this mean? It means we are quite literally in a once in a species moment.

00:15:31:47 - 00:16:08:58
不明
Humanity is mastering what exists deep in the universe and deep in the substructure of reality. And so we are coming into extraordinary abundance. Abundance of energy, abundance of resources, and abundance of internet connectivity. This should be exactly what we're here in Las Vegas for a jackpot. And it is an incredible jackpot. But it's easy to lose sight of this because we're constantly bombarded with the headlines about geopolitics.

00:16:09:03 - 00:16:32:11
不明
So I want to spend a little time talking about geopolitics and what the heck is going on. Where are we going? It's very scary to people who are working day to day, people that Adobe work with all the customer base of Adobe. You're just trying to do your thing and you keep getting these headlines that are frightening, that are disruptive, that are concerning.

00:16:32:16 - 00:16:59:09
不明
So let's dive in a little bit to what seems to be happening on that front, because as economists looking out over the future, part of it is going to be technology. But part of it is also what's happening in the world of public policy. So I think that we're in a period of extraordinary stress between the superpowers. Our attention has been entirely focused on Ukraine that has that's the story.

00:16:59:09 - 00:17:27:31
不明
There's a war in Ukraine, and we're told it's a simple story. There are good guys, they're bad guys. And it's important that the good guys win. Right now there's a big question mark about that, because we have the leaders of the superpowers. On negotiating for a potential ceasefire and settlement in Ukraine. But I think in order to truly understand what's going on, we have to step back and understand there's much more happening than Ukraine.

00:17:27:35 - 00:17:54:04
不明
But the more isn't easy to explain. So I'm going to do my best to try to explain to you why we're actually in a hot war in cold places. What do I mean by that? I mean, we're having conflict in space. Obviously, if space holds the key to the abundance that I've described, then the superpowers care who gets there first.

00:17:54:08 - 00:18:23:58
不明
If that holds the key to unlimited energy, unlimited resources, unlimited internet connectivity, those are very valuable prizes. So space is one. We're also in confrontation between, particularly the US, China and Russia in the Arctic and the High North. Lots of events occurring, some of which I'll explain. And we seem to be more and more conflict on the high seas above and below the high seas.

00:18:24:03 - 00:18:57:13
不明
So that's a kind of hot war in cold places. But it's super hard for the media to tell you about that, because there are no journalists in space and it's all classified. There are no journalists at sea. It's all classified, but doesn't mean the events aren't occurring. We're also in a kind of hot war in cold places. The United States and Russia, for example, have been facing off across Africa, but particularly in the north of Africa, the US and China jockeying for footholds across the Pacific.

00:18:57:17 - 00:19:27:45
不明
And there's been a significant buildup of military capability on both sides across the Pacific. And you may have heard about the US and China having stress about the South China Sea and who really owns and to control that. So let's go just a little bit deeper to try to understand geopolitics. And why does it matter to us? Well, we had an event that happened about a month before the Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine.

00:19:27:50 - 00:19:50:47
不明
And that event happened on this tiny little island inside the Arctic Circle in Norway, a place called Svalbard. Now, you may say, I don't even know where the heck this is. And why should it matter to me? Well, because someone cut what is the fastest internet cable in the world. And your question should be why is the fastest internet cable in the world?

00:19:51:01 - 00:20:15:32
不明
On a tiny little island in the Arctic Circle. I mean, who is using that? It's a bunch of polar bears up there, right? Well, the answer is that these internet cables get severed for a very specific reason, and that is because virtually every satellite connects to Earth at the Arctic. If you think about it, the Earth is spinning.

00:20:15:37 - 00:20:37:53
不明
And so what's the most stable place? The North Pole. And that is where Svalbard is. Now, since we had that incident where that cable was mysteriously cut and still no one will say who did it. In fact, the Norwegians have had a big police investigation into who cut the cable. And three years later, they're like, we just really have no idea.

00:20:37:58 - 00:21:03:23
不明
And the reason is because they don't want to say who did it. Because if we say that we're going to be directly in conflict with a major superpower again, why do we care? We care because the satellites connect to this global network of subsea cables. And we have had nothing but subsea cable warfare since that time. And occasionally you'll read about a cable cut again.

00:21:03:23 - 00:21:32:49
不明
You say, well, this is all very interesting, but what does it mean to me? So my question to the audience is, how many people in this room have ordered food delivery to their hotel room or their front door on their phone? That would be everyone. So if you cut those cables, you won't have GPS on your phone. You won't have satnav, and you won't be able to order food, and you won't be able to do anything else on your phone because it will go like this screen completely blank.

00:21:32:54 - 00:22:02:55
不明
That is what is at stake. That is why the United States and China and Russia are effectively waging war beneath the seas and in space. It is all about who is going to get access to the ability of their phone to work day to day. So this is all becoming very expensive. War is expensive. The superpowers are now looking at the world saying, we've got a conflict in Ukraine.

00:22:02:59 - 00:22:40:14
不明
We've got a conflict in Israel, and we've got a conflict over Taiwan. These things are hugely expensive, especially against the backdrop of a future that is as bright, is full of possibility as what I've explained. So they're all starting to say, you know what? Maybe we should rethink this. Maybe we should look at the opportunity for peace. Maybe we should divert our money away from the deconstruct, destructive possibility of war towards the constructive possibility of science and the future.

00:22:40:19 - 00:23:07:16
不明
Now, how do you do that? Especially when all of these nations are massively in debt? The US has this huge debt problem. China has a huge debt problem. Europe has a huge debt problem. Russia has got a terrible problem. And even without the debt, we now have a new threat that's very serious. And that is the threat of a nuclear conflict.

00:23:07:20 - 00:23:41:58
不明
In other words, we're at a very similar moment to what John F Kennedy faced in 1962. And the Cuban Missile Crisis. And it's very interesting that the Kennedy papers have only just come out yesterday, that more and more reveal that what he wanted to do was negotiate. Now, I happen to know a lot about this, because my father was his advisor on the Cuban Missile Crisis, and he became a negotiator with the Soviets for many years on reducing nuclear weapons.

00:23:42:03 - 00:24:11:10
不明
So here's the thing, which is really interesting. And my dad try to explain to me is that when you really are facing the possible end of the world, nobody wants to do it. And this is a good thing. So interestingly, the moment that President Putin threatened nuclear weapons within an hour, the Chinese leadership came out and said, no nukes.

00:24:11:14 - 00:24:43:34
不明
Amazing. And because of that, it opened the door for the United States and China to start having a conversation. We made disagree about a lot of things, but if we can agree on this, that's important for the future of humanity. And so under the Biden team, that conversation began, and it continues under Trump. In addition, in the background here in the U.S., we also happen to have a huge new force in politics, something that I think hasn't received sufficient attention.

00:24:43:38 - 00:25:06:22
不明
We have a massive youth movement in this country. It's bigger than the youth movement that President Obama had. And that youth movement is saying no more war. And so we have now a president who's saying, we just can't afford this. And the youth of the country don't want to do it. And the possibilities for the future are so immense.

00:25:06:26 - 00:25:40:26
不明
Why are we talking about this? And that is why I think we're getting closer and closer to a tripartite deal between the superpowers to come to an agreement. Maybe not a perfect agreement, but some kind of agreement that brings us what we really want, which is some form of peace. The key here is that everyone understands what will happen once they reach a peace deal, and that is we will begin building, right, a peace deal.

00:25:40:31 - 00:26:05:37
不明
These things don't come along every day, right? Some of you are too young to even remember when the Berlin Wall fell. But when it did, it brought this massive peace dividend and the world economy took off. So it's important to recognize a peace dividend when it arrives. And I think we should be ready for that. But it's hard because the news is telling you every day that geopolitics is a messy disaster.

00:26:05:41 - 00:26:31:48
不明
But is it? And so, for example, we're currently talking about the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war ends. We're talking about the reconstruction of Gaza, which is super interesting and honestly, with the way it is today, a toxic no man's land. I think we should consider rebuilding it. This is exactly what the United States did during the Second World War.

00:26:31:53 - 00:26:57:29
不明
We said, let's rebuild Germany. Let's rebuild Europe. Let's create a world where we can all work together again. I think this is where they're heading. Taiwan is very interesting because our current president said in 2015, 2016 that it was not of such strategic critical interest for the United States as it used to be. Today, he said, we can negotiate that.

00:26:57:30 - 00:27:25:46
不明
We don't have to hang on to Taiwan. As an American, you know, controlled or protected entity. But part of that is because of tech. It's partly because Taiwan used to produce all the chips we need to make cars, to make phones, to make everything we rely on. But today, a lot of that chip production has moved to Texas, Taiwan, to Texas, Arizona and other parts of the United States.

00:27:25:51 - 00:27:56:40
不明
Plus, we're building a whole new category of chips that we never heard of before. Lots of new things are being innovated. And so the big chip company in Taiwan, TSMC, has just announced that they're going to be investing and building new chip production inside the US. So is there a way to cut a deal? Maybe so. Within China, there's a massive debate going on between the current leader, XI Jinping, and the Communist Party.

00:27:56:45 - 00:28:27:47
不明
And these are paying has been leaning in the direction of pretty tough talk with potentially getting into a war with the United States. And our Department of Defense keeps talking about it. Only this week, the Pentagon said the Chinese are practicing dogfights with artificial intelligence autonomous fighter jets. Pretty scary image comes to mind. But the Politburo in China, more and more is saying, can we go back to the old days when we were just all making money?

00:28:27:51 - 00:28:54:14
不明
Why do we have to go to war with the United States? Can't we just go back to doing business again? And I think that that community is more and more having influence and pushing China in a direction where it looks at the recent past and says the deal we struck over Hong Kong, maybe we shouldn't have totally ended the capitalist elements of Hong Kong.

00:28:54:19 - 00:29:18:19
不明
Maybe we could learn a lot. And Taiwan, we could protect its capacity to generate GDP and innovation and ideas and handle it in a different way. So I think we're heading towards something like the announcement of a 100 year deal. Hong Kong was a 25 year deal to remind you. But 100 years for China is a blink of an eye.

00:29:18:30 - 00:29:44:00
不明
That's nothing because they think long term. For Americans, 100 years is forever, right? We think that's a long way off. So what it does is it pushes the issue into the future. And that allows some space to think about how can China grow, especially if we're in a world where we have tariffs and we have barriers to entry to the US market.

00:29:44:05 - 00:30:09:51
不明
What options does China have? Because they still have 1.6 billion people that need to be fed. So there's a deal in the background that's very interesting. And if you pay attention you'll see there's more and more talk about the Chinese border effectively moving north. What does that mean? It means eastern Russia, a part of the world that's never had any investments that most people don't think about.

00:30:09:52 - 00:30:40:19
不明
Right. This is Siberia. Who cares about Siberia? Well, the answer is it contains a lot of raw assets that are important for China. It contains protein. It contains mined assets. It contains forestry. It contains water. So Russia actually will welcome the fact that China wants to invest in that. They can't say, oh, it's ours. And the Chinese should stay out.

00:30:40:22 - 00:31:10:03
不明
They need this part of the world to be developed. So is that a way that China can grow without impinging on the growth strategy of the United States? Yes. So I think we should keep an eye on that particular at this moment where, like I said, we are in a kind of Cuban missile crisis where there's a genuine fear that if we don't strike a deal, the possibility of nuclear weapons is on the table.

00:31:10:08 - 00:31:36:57
不明
But the good news is to say again, what my father learned from his experience negotiating nuclear weapons problems was that it always ends the same way and ends in a hug. Now, you may say, what? It ends in a hug. But look, that's exactly what happened with Nixon and Brezhnev. It's exactly what happened when I was an intern working for Ronald Reagan.

00:31:37:02 - 00:31:59:44
不明
No one could imagine that the leader of the United States was going to meet with the leader of the Soviet Union, let alone hug, practically kiss. Actually, no one could imagine that. But it happened. And so that's what I think is going to happen now. Again, once we get into any photo of a hug, the markets are going to go up.

00:31:59:48 - 00:32:26:54
不明
The future is going to just unfold in a much faster and more positive rate. So one way to think about this moment is not who wins and who loses, but something that the former iron chancellor of Germany used to say. Someone who knew more about diplomacy than almost anyone alive today. They said diplomacy is the art of building ladders that allow other people to climb down.

00:32:26:59 - 00:32:53:08
不明
And I think maybe we're in a climb down. But why? Partly because the future is full of such extraordinary abundance. What the heck are we fighting over? But also because many changes have happened here on earth that have materially changed the landscape. And one of them, of course, is Covid and the complete reconstruction of supply chains around the world.

00:32:53:12 - 00:33:24:18
不明
Well, one piece of that puzzle is that one location has emerged as the most dynamic, important part of the world economy, and that is the Mexico southern US area. Now, you may say what? But I'm telling you, as an economist, this is the most dynamic part of the world economy. China fully understands that Mexico has become the new China.

00:33:24:23 - 00:33:49:46
不明
They are not competitive compared to where Mexico is today. Mexico is now the source of the most important supply chains into the US economy. And you say, but wait, wait, I thought we had all these issues when we're building a wall and the immigration and the border. Yes. But nobody really mentions all the Americans getting into private jets, flying south to build all this new productive capability.

00:33:49:51 - 00:34:24:41
不明
But that is what is happening. And so, yes, we have headlines all the time about this new world where the current administration is threatening tariffs. But maybe now we can begin to step back and understand that it's a negotiating strategy, and it's partly designed to deal with some U.S. domestic problems, not just foreign problems. So I come back to the U.S., where we have a massive debt and possible debt to pay off the households of America simply cannot pay it off.

00:34:24:46 - 00:34:51:52
不明
So one proposal that the current president is pursuing is the idea that maybe we could go back to previous 1914. Remember, the IRS didn't come into existence and the Federal Reserve didn't come into existence until then. Before that. Where do we get the revenue from? The answer is tariffs. And so he's proposed that we create not just an Internal Revenue Service but an external revenue service.

00:34:51:57 - 00:35:15:32
不明
And while we might not like the negotiating tactics where he imposes, let's say, a 50% tariff on some of our near neighbors, everybody has a heart attack. But if we end up with a 2% tariff, which is probably where we're headed, that is revenue that Americans then don't have to pay an income tax. And that is perceived as a vote winner.

00:35:15:37 - 00:35:44:20
不明
We'll see. But it's connected to something even bigger, which is a shift in the technology of money itself. So you think innovation happens only to science, space, materials, transportation? Yeah. It also happens to money. And so currently, the United States is leading the way to shift away from an old system of money and accounting to a new one.

00:35:44:25 - 00:36:12:05
不明
Every single one of you listening to this talk are going to have to face the fact that the US is creating a Bitcoin reserve, and they are increasingly moving on to blockchain as the accounting system. Now this is massive in the course of history. And so let me say that it is quite possible that when you can't pay down your debt, one way to solve it is you abandon the whole system of money and accounting and you introduce a new one.

00:36:12:10 - 00:36:38:04
不明
Everyone says, are you out of your mind? You cannot just abandon the system of money in accounting and start again. Yes you can. And we have. So the last time we did it on a large scale was in Britain in 1834. For a thousand years before then, they used a system called Tally sticks, where they took a wooden board and cracked it in half really unevenly.

00:36:38:09 - 00:36:56:09
不明
And the shorter end of the stick you kept, and you put a record of everything you owned and all your tax payments on that. That's where we get the phrase the shorter end of the stick, the longer end of the stick went to the Chancellor so they could track what was happening in the economy. But it's really hard to carry around these big wooden boards.

00:36:56:14 - 00:37:18:03
不明
So people miniaturized them and put them on a loop on their belt and took them to a market. Now those little tiny miniature versions were called stocks. And this is the origin of the term the stock market. This is where it came from. It was a whole system of money in accounting that worked perfectly for a thousand years.

00:37:18:08 - 00:37:35:51
不明
And then they realized they had so much debt that couldn't get out of their debt. They decided to introduce a new technology called paper money. And so the king said, okay, we're going to move away from tally sticks, and now we're going to use paper money. You know, the public reaction, the public's like, are you out of your mind?

00:37:35:56 - 00:38:05:23
不明
I'm not giving up this thing that has my personal history on it. For a piece of paper that doesn't even have my name. So the king said, fine, we're going to confiscate the tally sticks. We're going to take them to Parliament, and we're going to burn them, which they did. And there's a wonderful painter called William Turner. And William Turner painted the Burning of Parliament, because they misjudged how much heat would be thrown off by the burning of the tally sticks.

00:38:05:23 - 00:38:32:31
不明
And that is what burned Parliament to the ground in 1834. It was the destruction of a system of money and accounting and the introduction of a new one. So it may sound scary to say we're going to change the system of money in accounting. But what did that event do? It actually began the Industrial revolution. And I think that today innovation and money will also begin to spur incredible, extraordinary outcomes.

00:38:32:36 - 00:38:57:14
不明
So where are we now? We have a government that is trying to figure out where is the money. Where are the losses? Where is the debt? What's the true picture? It's exactly I hate to say it, but what Bill Clinton al Gore tried to do when they came into government with their reinventing government proposition. So what's the difference between where the Donald Trump team today is doing and what they were doing?

00:38:57:15 - 00:39:23:33
不明
The answer is artificial intelligence. So think of it as artificial intelligence has a cabinet seat in the United States today, and they are rolling that AI out over all the government data to figure out where are these holes. Where has the money gone? Where can things be fixed? Where can these things be revalued? Where are things not properly accounted for?

00:39:23:38 - 00:39:50:15
不明
It's a hard process, but it's also tied to using AI to go over that data, to also figure out solutions like how do we improve the health of Americans? How do we make it easier to have less chronic disease, etc.? It's kind of hard to think about this because people are very emotional about which side they're on in politics.

00:39:50:20 - 00:40:11:27
不明
But what I'm trying to do is step a little away from that and get you to look at the world and understand we have a choice about how to think about the future. Are we right on the brink of peace and potential abundance, or are we right on the brink of World War three? That is something you will have to decide.

00:40:11:32 - 00:40:45:44
不明
But what I see is a world where young innovators see what I'm seeing. I see a world where the digital nomads are expanding everywhere. The tools of artificial intelligence and others are allowing people to build and create in ways that were never possible before. I'm also seeing a world where my generation, the old folks, are saying, wait, I should probably come back to work because I'm going to live longer than I thought because I don't have enough saved.

00:40:45:57 - 00:41:14:50
不明
And because it's just so darn interesting. What is possible now was never possible before. I can work for several different employers. I can create cash flows using apps on my phone. I can solve problems without having to be a permanent employee of one company. I can have a portfolio of activities. If we listen to Silicon Valley and people like Peter Thiel, he says, you know what?

00:41:14:57 - 00:41:40:48
不明
Some of these digital nomads, older people returning to the workforce, they're going to create unicorns, and they will often now be able to do it with only 2 or 3 other people. We're not going to need massive corporations in the way we used to. Now we will have a lot of small ones that are incredibly good at generating massive cash flows.

00:41:40:53 - 00:42:15:52
不明
That's important, again, for all of you to think about who are going to be your customers in the future. I suspect you will see more and more small companies with big cash flows. And that's new because in the past we always think only big companies generate big cash flows. But I think in the future, small companies are going to generate big cash flows because of abundance, because of all these tools at our disposal, because problem solving is happening at such an incredible speed.

00:42:15:57 - 00:42:55:37
不明
So now is a time to begin exercising imagination. This is not easy. Every single one who is listening to this talk, you've all been trained to be highly, highly analytical, highly technical. We're all very good at dealing with balance sheets, dealing with spreadsheets, telling what needs to be told through numbers and math. But the reality is that humanity has always had two very separate technology for conveying reality.

00:42:55:42 - 00:43:26:58
不明
And these go back to the beginning of time. And one is math and one is stories. Most of us are really good at the math part, but you know what? People don't remember numbers. They aren't moved by numbers. And I think part of the reason that Adobe has such an incredible success is that you facilitate the telling of the story of the visual imagery that explains what's going on.

00:43:27:03 - 00:43:55:59
不明
It's one thing to look at a balance sheet and another thing to understand the vivid, colorful human story. So one of the recommendations I have for all of you is to think about this quote from Mark Twain, where he says, you can't depend on your eyes if your imagination is out of focus. How many of us have an imagination that is properly in focus for the world that I've described?

00:43:56:03 - 00:44:28:01
不明
How many of us are tracking these extraordinary innovations in such a way that we can begin to see the possibilities of the future, as if you can't see them, you can't participate in them. So this is not like in your spare time. You need to look at all the stuff I've talked about. This awareness of what is happening becomes a central task, not just for what you're doing professionally, but also for you personally.

00:44:28:06 - 00:45:03:14
不明
What are the opportunities that are unfolding before our eyes that you should be part of? And so which side of your brain are you using? Are we stuck in a what I'd call left brain lock, where we're trying to be rational and, you know, highly scientific and use the data as our source of information? Or are we going to be, I think like what Jeff Bezos says, if I ever have a dispute between the data and the customer stories, I'm with the customers every time.

00:45:03:19 - 00:45:28:14
不明
The stories carry more weight than the data. So what's our capacity to engage on the storytelling side? This is a huge, huge question because sometimes we don't realize how stuck we are in traditional ways of thinking, oh, that can never happen. When I was growing up, if you'd said there's water on the moon, they would have carted you off to an insane asylum.

00:45:28:18 - 00:45:53:42
不明
Today we know there's water on the moon. Things we take for granted are transforming before our eyes. So I want to finish up. And I'm happy to take some questions. We have a couple of mics if anybody wants to dive in. If we finish slightly early, that gives everybody who's currently having a hangover a little bit more time to grab some water.

00:45:53:47 - 00:46:23:48
不明
But I want to leave you with this thought. What I'm describing for you is a world where we have been trained to assume that the driver of the economy is scarcity, when in fact we're at a truly historic moment for humanity, where the driver is abundance. This is no small thing. I don't even know, as an economist, how does the economy work if you have abundance, right?

00:46:23:54 - 00:46:55:10
不明
Prices are determined by scarcity. How do you price things if we never have any limit on energy, on internet connectivity, on raw materials, on 3D printing, not just whatever you need, but yourself. How do you price up that world? I don't know, but I think all of you are going to have to face these questions during our lifetimes because this is not 50 years away.

00:46:55:15 - 00:47:24:00
不明
This is not ten years away. Everything I've told you is now. And so we live in an era of Earthshot, an era of moonshots. This is a time where imagination is going to pay a whole lot more than analytics. That is a massive change for every single one of us. But I think a super exciting one and I personally am just so encouraged.

00:47:24:05 - 00:47:43:25
不明
I see exactly why every time you open up the paper, you look at your phone. It's easy to get overwhelmed and I thank God the end of the world. Things are bad. By the way, especially here in the US, I travel all over the world. I've just literally last night flown in from India. I'm on a trip where I was in Indonesia.

00:47:43:26 - 00:48:10:30
不明
I was in Central America, most recently India. The whole rest of the world is saying to me, how do I get my money into the United States? The US is the most dynamic, happening, innovative economy on the planet. They've identified that it's the juxtaposition of the leading emerging market Mexico, with the leading industrialized country market. It's the US.

00:48:10:35 - 00:48:37:37
不明
And then I come to the US, everybody's like, it's bad. It's really bad. Like we don't know, is the US ever going to recover? And I'm like, wow, it's so interesting how perception drives all of us. So what I'm trying to tell you is the future is actually so incredibly, blindingly bright. Don't miss it. So I'll finish there.

00:48:37:42 - 00:48:58:21
不明
There's a little link in case you guys like these ideas. I write about this all the time to try to give you a way to understand what's happening without having to go through all the hard research yourself. But I think this is a very, very exciting time. And with that, we'll move and see. Does anybody want to go a little into questions?

00:48:58:22 - 00:49:18:24
不明
Anybody awake? Enough. Brave enough to join me. Do any of you guys have a view on what I've said? Are you seeing in your business? And I'll finish on that. I'm so grateful to have the opportunity to talk to you today. Thank you very much.

00:49:18:29 - 00:49:18:47
不明
For.
