00:00:00:14 - 00:00:24:56
不明
Also, I am managing director for Adobe Advertising. I'm really excited to be on stage and share, how you guys can capitalize on the new cable driving customer acquisition with connected television. Joining me on stage soon will also be Natasha, who's the display programmatic lead for Thermo Fisher Scientific and has an absolutely amazing journey to share with you all.

00:00:25:01 - 00:00:32:24
不明
So I want to get started by just sharing some data, some background on connected television.

00:00:32:28 - 00:01:00:09
不明
So not only is everyone thinking about connected television, we're talking about it. And according to the IAB, you're all investing, in connected television. They predict an increase of 13.9% in 2025 alone. Adobe Advertising recently did a study, surveying marketers and key decision makers at brands trying to understand why they're investing in connect television and how they're doing it.

00:01:00:13 - 00:01:26:25
不明
57% of marketers that we researched agreed that they will continue to invest more into connected television in 2025. On the flip side of that, though, of course, is the 43% who, saying that they're going to spend the same or less. And when we broke that down further, we still say 20% of brands are not investing in connected television at all today.

00:01:26:30 - 00:01:48:18
不明
So the key reasons that we say why people are not planning to increase their investments in connected television, they want and need more granular targeting and reporting options within the connected television environment. They haven't seen strong results.

00:01:48:23 - 00:02:16:06
不明
They do not feel that connected television can deliver them the performance metrics that they require. And finally, the perception of the price of connected television is too high. And we have this conversation a lot around CPMs and also the cost of entry into connected television. And that misdirection of it's the same as a customer entering into linear television as connected television.

00:02:16:11 - 00:02:54:53
不明
And then when we have discussions, and what we see on a daily basis is brands optimizing towards rates when they actually want conversions. Measuring CCTV's impact in a silo and ignoring its impact on channels like paid search, your natural search, how it interplays and works with, display. And not only are they looking at connected television as a silo within connected television, majority of brands are also optimizing application and channel by channel by channel.

00:02:54:58 - 00:03:23:24
不明
So they're actually looking at two separate silos and then creating another silo and optimizing it and measuring by individual publisher. On the flip side, back to those 57% of brands who are looking to increase their connected television, they are three times more likely to leverage connected television as a lower funnel tactic.

00:03:23:29 - 00:03:33:36
不明
They have already seen success and effectiveness of connected television, and they see that as a key reason to continue to invest.

00:03:33:41 - 00:03:58:39
不明
And what we always talk about and what we always say, and one of the great panels of connected television is buying premium is critically important to them to enable them to continue to invest more. And then breaking that down into the winning strategies that we see the correct KPIs. 60% are using KPIs or Roas to optimize their connected television campaigns.

00:03:58:44 - 00:04:33:53
不明
Holistic measurement. So removing and moving away from those silos to start to look at how connected television interplays with all of their channels, both in paid media and also in owned media and across social media, and the ability to be able to more precisely target. So not just buying a network and then going forward with it, buying within that network and understand the content objects, what type of content you're being around and optimizing across all of those different avenues that you can.

00:04:33:58 - 00:05:01:33
不明
So what are we? Just one slides a very quick reminder. So we're at the Adobe Advertising DSP, a centralized platform for buying paid media across, channels. We have AI powered optimization engine that maximizes ROI, and we have the most advanced connections to the Adobe Experience Cloud. We help you get more out of your investments in the Adobe Experience Cloud.

00:05:01:37 - 00:05:29:03
不明
And I've been with quite a few of us, have been around for for quite a while. I've been working with both the Adobe advertising platform and the technology that provided that as a client for, for a number of years. And the key thing that has always been central to the way that we think and operate, and the decisions that we make as a business is a long term focus on accountability and transparency.

00:05:29:08 - 00:06:10:13
不明
And this was actually right at the beginning of when we started our software. We were one of the first businesses to disrupt the ad network model. We wanted brands and agencies to be able to see exactly where they were buying their media, and the dynamics that were existing behind that media, rather than at that stage. For those that remember very much blind ad networks to drive your performance over the years, I'm not going to go through everything, but some of the things that I'm most excited and proud of, the work that we've been doing, launching, planning and buying against audiences such as Nielsen and Facebook and using that measurement to help us

00:06:10:18 - 00:06:40:13
不明
to use audience and targeted audience as a proxy for performance. And then we started to look at how we can optimize your connected television as a performance channel using device graphs and, looking at it from publisher to publisher until we linked your martech investment with your advertising investment and the ability to put you through conversions from, your connected television and save them inside of Adobe Analytics.

00:06:40:18 - 00:06:52:00
不明
And most recently, moving from a publisher model, to offsetting and supporting your publisher direct buys by using auction based buys.

00:06:52:05 - 00:07:18:45
不明
And, we're excited as well to to and I'm going to share some of the data insights around this to launch Performance Pro in 2026, which is going to be, help you as marketers maximize your investment and maximize the conversions, that you're driving by. Understand and loading in your display and your CTV to help you drive performances.

00:07:18:50 - 00:07:49:11
不明
And why we thinking around that and why are we thinking performance pro? We know that we need to make smarter eye, driven optimization. Our shift from publisher to publisher buying to auction based buying has already seen many brands achieve 20% improvements in their APIs and increase their reach. You, as brands and marketers, want cross-channel attribution, and we need better data integration.

00:07:49:11 - 00:08:21:22
不明
And we continue to build that out, especially on top of the Adobe experience, platform products where we're again pushing out the signals and data into analytics. But we're also taking that information out into our platform to feed our algorithms, to make your media performance campaigns perform better, that things like data collaboration, privacy first, audience strategies, whether that's, 1 to 1 collaboration, whether that's working with publishers and using authenticated and publisher IDs.

00:08:21:37 - 00:08:44:16
不明
We're seeing this reshape the way that we think about buying. And when we do this, we see increasing engagement of up to five times. And then the final one is I know a lot of this conversation is around performance, but we're starting to see brands and performance come together. Connected television is the most powerful asset that you have as a brand.

00:08:44:16 - 00:09:11:43
不明
Sight, sound, motion 30% 32nd ads a very engaged audience leaning in and watching your content. It's your chance to create an emotional connection with those consumers. Start to build your brand. Start to build the emotional connection and take those users through the journey from not knowing about your brand to falling in love with your brand, and then becoming in-market and buying your brand.

00:09:11:48 - 00:09:45:46
不明
And this all sits inside of Adobe's solution to drive customer acquisition. The way that we think about this is plan, reach, measure, optimize. Adobe advertising can help you reach your audiences at scale, whether that's via, data collaboration, whether that's by using, publisher signals to enable you to help optimize, we reach your audience at scale. And then we also help, of course, optimize within those channels.

00:09:45:51 - 00:10:12:01
不明
And the way that we think of it, though, and this is so critical, is customer acquisition isn't just about driving sheer volume of traffic to your properties. What it is is about driving quality traffic to your properties. And that's going to maximize your conversions on site. And the way that you do this is starting to think about different ways of buying connected television.

00:10:12:06 - 00:10:33:01
不明
And the way the we think about it is there's four unique ways that you can really buy and drive connected television. And I don't think there's a wrong way that there is definitely a right way. And that's starting to think about how do you use these all together to help you maximize your reach and maximize your impact? The first is Publisher Direct.

00:10:33:06 - 00:11:01:29
不明
The publisher manages activation directly via their ad server. So if you're using something like data collaboration, you would create a deal. You would do a partnership with the publisher, and then you would send your data over to the to the publisher, and then they would serve your ads on your behalf. A private deal is fundamentally the same thing, but they send us over what we call a daily day, and we're actually able to optimize that.

00:11:01:29 - 00:11:29:07
不明
So it's not just, serving every ad that the publisher wants us to serve. We can actually decision on that because we know, for example, a Monday is a high converting day. We're going to spend more money and invest more of your, time and advertising investment on a Monday in the afternoon. And it help us to understand that audience indication is, is is, basically the same as the private deal, but it's based on audiences.

00:11:29:12 - 00:11:51:01
不明
And again, they send that over to us and then finally auction based where the DSP does that. All of the decisioning for you, it dynamically values and buys the media on your behalf. And when you think about that and why this is important is publisher direct, the publisher is doing the execution and they're buying the media. Well, they're not buying the media, sorry.

00:11:51:11 - 00:12:04:18
不明
They are placing the media on your behalf. The other three is all decisions via a DSP. Now, why is that important?

00:12:04:23 - 00:12:40:28
不明
The reason that's important is we want to understand all of the nuances that exist inside of your brand, and we know that if we can make better decisions, we can drive better performance. I mentioned that stat early when we moved to auction based buying, rather than publisher based buying. 20% improvement in CPA. We know that buying premium inventory helps you to improve your CPA as well, and so you need to buy across as many publishers as possible to enable you to buy those and increased, I say decrease those KPIs.

00:12:40:33 - 00:13:10:28
不明
Not only is it important to buy across publishers, it's also critical to understand how you're buying within those publishers. Now, borrowing from the legacy of linear television, where first in break has a loading on it and costs more then the second and third in break, and that data is based on, Nielsen viewers viewership consumption and has been a long way of trading television.

00:13:10:32 - 00:13:37:01
不明
The same effect happens in connected television, which is exactly what you would expect. But obviously it's always wonderful to say that data backs up your into intuition when you buy the first slot in the pod. And so a part is fundamentally a group of ads that exist when you're watching connected television. The load can sometimes, you know, the lag can be three, but it can be up to 5 or 7.

00:13:37:05 - 00:14:00:59
不明
Using a DSP can help you to bid on the exact slot that is going to drive the best performance for your brand. This is an example of of a data set where we tested buying slot A, the middle and then also the final slot, and you can see the significant increase in return on media spend by buying the first slot.

00:14:01:04 - 00:14:28:24
不明
The great thing is as well is unlike linear, there is no loading. I'm going to say today I'm buying the first in slot because it's an underutilized tactic to help drive performance, and it's an underutilized signal that is used inside of many buying platforms. So when we're thinking about premium and we're thinking about how we buy, we're also so excited that we're including Amazon inside of our buying platform.

00:14:28:29 - 00:14:56:29
不明
So you can now trade and execute on Amazon the exactly the same way. But you can try it on all of the publishers that exist inside of our platform today. This is so exciting because it gives us significant access to scale, and it also enables you as brands to get in there and test, and understand how is it working and how is it driving performance for your brand?

00:14:56:33 - 00:15:16:49
不明
When we start to think about all of that, and now we need to start to think about the way that we're making this decisions and the data infrastructure that we're building for our future. And we fundamentally know AI is going to change the way that you trade programmatic media. And we're starting to build towards that future today.

00:15:16:54 - 00:15:39:16
不明
The way that we see this and the infrastructure that we are building is the marketable input there. Those the block lists. Third party vendors and also be able to query and pull in historical campaigns, whether that's year on year campaigns or it's a similar campaign that they've run the last month and help them understand exactly what is taking place.

00:15:39:21 - 00:16:17:50
不明
We will then feed fade out three key things recommend and set up your forecast. And of course, then you'll be able to do in-flight optimization. You recommended set up. We'll help you with formats, your budgets. It'll help you understand what audiences and IDs that you need to buy. And you site and publish a mix. Best of all, for many of the traders, if there are any traders in the room or your team who are traders, it will also also automatically construct your placements, making speed to market will then deliver an AI powered forecast, will predict spend impressions, CPMs and KPIs.

00:16:17:55 - 00:16:35:25
不明
And that's really important because some marketers have a set budget, some marketers have a CPA that they need to hit, and so you will be able to either put in, I have $1 million, what is my projected output? Or you'll be able to say, I have a CPI of $50. How am I going to be able to achieve that?

00:16:35:25 - 00:17:02:36
不明
And what is the model that's going to be able to do that? You will then have conversational scenario planning. You'll be able to query why the software is making those decisions. And you might also be able to say, what channels you don't want. It may project that a certain channel or a certain publisher and you can say yes or no and have a conversation and continue to evolve those media plans.

00:17:02:41 - 00:17:25:12
不明
Once we get into optimization, we'll be looking at, propensity. So the understanding of how exactly we're going to buy that media, what is the likely outcome. And then also, of course, being on the buy side is how can we drive that media efficiency for the lowest cost as possible.

00:17:25:17 - 00:17:59:11
不明
It'll all be underpinned by conversational, interface. And having actually been a trader many, many years ago, the ability to be able to not have to pull reports and try to find the answer, but actually just ask a question and have the software help you with the answer. For example, why did my CPA change yesterday and be able to surface that insight and then have a conversation around that is going to be so critical, for how you drive your success and also how we how we demonstrate the work that we're doing inside of the business.

00:17:59:15 - 00:18:23:27
不明
I just remember, like, writing crazy media reports and having to do a summary in an email of a click through rate changing and having to try to work out why and quite often having no idea why. But it would take six hours to do instantly just having a query and finding the the data. And so this looks like, you know, this is a future facing vision of where we're seeing it, but we are building this today.

00:18:23:32 - 00:18:33:09
不明
Performance Pro is the start of what we are creating, especially in the AI powered optimization.

00:18:33:14 - 00:18:48:35
不明
And what I want to do is demonstrate a couple of data assets that I think is really interesting and help you to understand the way that we are seeing the relationship that exists between the media channels that are bought in our software today.

00:18:48:40 - 00:19:12:50
不明
So what we're starting to think about is the role of CTV and how it drives performance, but also how it drives brand and its relationship that it has with your other media channels. What you're seeing here is, a normalized conversion rate for CTV and display. And where in the path CTV is appearing, and then where in the path sky is appearing.

00:19:12:55 - 00:19:41:18
不明
What you're seeing here on in the campaign. One is that CTV early on has a really high conversion rate when it's early in the path, and then it let's display do the work over time, though, its effect wears off and you see that display actually maintains a consistency. However, for the exact same brand for a different campaign, the exact opposite is also true.

00:19:41:23 - 00:20:23:04
不明
So here you're seeing that display early in the path is actually driving higher conversion rates than CTV. Then when CTV is lighter in the path. It drives faster action and faster conversion. So what we're building is the ability for you to be able to load a a budget and a CPA and have, I understand that and not, dictate the journey, but have them have the machine learning help you to understand the journey and then optimize based on the best path possible?

00:20:23:09 - 00:20:42:18
不明
And the key to that is, you know, all too often in traditional media, funnels say TV is brand, then you have to display as you performance driver. But that fundamentally is no longer the case. You need to understand what is the role of the channel. And then how can software help you to to use that to maximize performance.

00:20:42:23 - 00:21:07:04
不明
And we say all the time in so many campaigns that CTV plus display actually drives significant improvement in CPA. And our ROI models are going to help you to value those higher users and understand exactly what ad and ads format to to deliver to help you to maximize the number of conversions.

00:21:07:08 - 00:21:32:34
不明
We're also inside of our software building out insights dashboards, which helps you to visualize that data. I'm first to admit those previous charts, are not the most intuitive, but what we're helping you to build is simple, intuitive insights to help you to understand, how users are engaging with your brand across those channels and how you can better plan and buy your media.

00:21:32:38 - 00:22:04:52
不明
We see huge demand for this and huge insight and huge appetite for this, to help them to understand when you're using multiple channels, how different consumers engaging with your brand. And then of course, so important to our business model and you driving your success is the ability to be able to integrate across your entire, digital experience ecosystem.

00:22:04:57 - 00:22:30:51
不明
We have the ability to be able to push view through conversions from connected television into your Adobe Analytics package and use that as your single source of truth, so you can see all of your conversions driven via CTV, by a natural search, by your email campaigns, and also the interrelationship with those media campaigns and campaigns all have on each other.

00:22:30:55 - 00:22:46:47
不明
We then also take event level data and what is taking place on your site, and push that back into our software to help power our algorithms to deliver better performance for you all.

00:22:46:52 - 00:23:20:24
不明
So the key things that I want to take away from from this is align. Make sure that we're setting the right KPIs and align your KPIs with your performance goals. It seems obvious, but all too often we do say mis mismatch goals for the channel versus what is actually the campaign goals. Integrate your measurement and strategies across all of your channels, including non-paid, to deliver a unified cross-channel attribution and help you to maximize your conversions.

00:23:20:29 - 00:23:54:16
不明
And then also balance your CTV by you going to do by direct with publishers. How do you balance that and offset that with data collaboration, and then also making sure that your integrating that all into one software that can maximize your reach and impact via auction based, deals to enable you, to help you to maximize your reach and those conversions and underpinning that is that we continue to say that AI is beating and is making, is improving on the status quo.

00:23:54:21 - 00:24:15:49
不明
We want to not only give you Roas, but we also want to share insights with you and help you to understand why your campaigns are performing, why they performed historically, and what's going to happen in the future. I'm going to hand you over to Natasha now to take you through her journey with Thermo Fisher. Thank you.

00:24:15:53 - 00:24:39:01
不明
Good morning everyone. Can you guys hear me? Okay. All right. Perfect. I hope you guys are having a great Adobe Summit experience and truly enjoyed the bash last night. I know it's hard to do a 9 a.m. session, so I will try to be a little bit funny for you. Before I speak about my success of, performance connected TV, I'd like to take a few moments and introduce myself.

00:24:39:03 - 00:25:15:18
不明
My name is Natasha Hasnain, and I am the programmatic lead and strategist at Thermo Fisher Scientific. My background encompasses a variety of industry and services from CPG, entertainment, healthcare and energy. I have lived coast to coast, west and east, but I will not tell you which one is best. My background encompasses a variety of, I'm sorry. So I've worked at many, many agencies building my digital marketing career and not only programmatic, but social media, CRM, affiliate and influencer marketing.

00:25:15:22 - 00:25:39:12
不明
So before I go into my section of measuring ROI with performance TV, I want to say I've been in your shoes. I know the challenges you are facing when it comes to strategy and activation at the top, top tier funnel tactics. So let me show you how I achieved ROI in CTV for my campaign at Thermo Fisher.

00:25:39:17 - 00:26:10:08
不明
So who is Thermo Fisher? Thermo Fisher is a global leader in scientific research and laboratory solutions. We provide a wide range of products and services in healthcare, life sciences, pharmaceuticals, and industrial applications. Our mission statement is our purpose to enable our customers to make the world cleaner, healthier and safer. We have a depth of capabilities that we bucket into four that are bucketed into four.

00:26:10:13 - 00:26:47:33
不明
We have lifestyle solutions, analytical instruments, specialty diagnostics, and laboratory services and products. Today we will focus on the life science solutions, specifically the bioscience, which is also known as the ID Bioscience division. My division primarily focuses on providing a broad range of products and solutions for life science research, drug discovery and biotech application. But hey, if I'm talking to scientist without a PhD and explaining to them what it is, you can talk to your stakeholders.

00:26:47:38 - 00:27:18:23
不明
So before I show you, my CTV gameplan and the data that backs it up, let's talk about the Thermo Fisher relationship with Adobe. In 2019, we started our relationship and tested their technology across a smaller line of business. We tested DSP search, social and commerce. In 2022, we expanded our relationship and onboarded more lines of businesses and scaled our media spend and started diving deeper into their tech.

00:27:18:28 - 00:27:52:47
不明
This helped us measure our campaign success. In 2023, we evolved our KPIs, not only looking at site on site engaged visits, we further tracked internal searches. Form starts, form completions, and we moved from a click through attribution into a view through attribution. In 2024, we embarked our cookie ish world where we live in still. We decided to expand our creative capabilities from display and moved it into video.

00:27:52:52 - 00:28:19:38
不明
We tested online video at the start of 2020 for an H1, and then tested CTV in H2. And trust me, it was a great decision. Now, in 2025, we plan to expand our CTV and bring more lines of businesses and then test the new capabilities that Phil just recently mentioned. So just like any activation, we had to come up with a game plan.

00:28:19:38 - 00:28:42:57
不明
And like many of you in this room, budget is a huge factor when it comes to deciding on what to activate. Let's be honest, paid search continues to get the majority of it and gets the credit. But without top funnel tactics like CTV and display, what would an audience search for? At Thermo Fisher, we like to take the crawl walk, run approach.

00:28:43:02 - 00:29:11:59
不明
And it wasn't easy convincing my stakeholders that I wanted to invest in a new tactic. So when molecular biology received incremental budget in July, I seized the opportunity to test connected TV. This wasn't a standard ad placement for a brand that sells lab instruments and products. It's not like I'm selling a $20 water bottle. I had to be very strategic and very crafty when leveraging the additional budget with already existing creatives.

00:29:12:04 - 00:29:38:13
不明
So what did I do? I repurposed a page social media videos of polymerase chain reaction. I know that's a mouthful, but it's called PCR for short. And instead of, using just a salt lake, solely focusing on one product, we, focused on an array of products, and that helped us, expand our brand awareness as well as the opportunity to scale targeting.

00:29:38:17 - 00:30:10:07
不明
Additionally, thereafter, we utilize the exposure pixel that the CTV uppercut. The CTV opportunity in Adobe AD Cloud provides. And we targeted the exposed audience with products specific within the molecular biology, business unit. That alone increased our engage visit month over month. And not only that, we optimized our packages to have CPA and Roas optimization goals, and this helped us reach new households through the programmatic premium CTV providers.

00:30:10:12 - 00:30:41:24
不明
We leveraged ESPN, the Samsung TV plus, and Direct TV, to name a few. Remember when I said I had to talk to scientists about CTR and explain that? Well, now I had to explain the halo effect to them and prove the impact that CTV has on mid to bottom funnel channels like search. We leveraged Adobe Analytics and segmented the data for CTV, and found an increase in visits through multiple marketing channels like organic search and paid social.

00:30:41:29 - 00:31:00:57

But that's not all. We even gained more internal searches, like I mentioned, which is part of our new KPIs from 2023 within the just within the website due to connected TV, the first month alone, our internal searches surpassed 100% when compared to the previous month.

Now I knew the CPMs were going to be more expensive. It's video after all, but ours was four times more. But because per visit was 29% less than a standard display ad or a display placement for that matter. Additionally, what we found was that audiences who were exposed to the CTV video were then coming back to our site and staying on our site 10% longer than a regular standard video standard ad.

So connected TV helps Thermo Fisher basically streamline our customer journey and nurture our audience down the marketing funnel. So what does this all mean? At the end of the day? Adobe AD Cloud gives us the opportunity to diversify our tactics. So when using connected TV and display synergistically, the audience is converted at a much higher rate. For Thermo Fisher alone, connected TV and display had 286% higher conversion rate than just a standalone CTV placement.

And then when you add search to the mix, we saw a 500% increase in conversions. This alone gave us the fuel to not only request extra budget, but also recommend connected TV in the DSP. Now I'm able to speak to my scientists about CTR and the CTV Halo effect when taking off the new go to market strategy plans.

So what's next for Thermo Fisher? We're going to continue leveraging our connected TV tactic alongside display and other channels like Social and Search, to provide a better customer journey. We're going to launch CTV and retargeting with the CDP integration. We want to utilize educational content videos like how to videos to drive customer success. If the customers are successful, we're successful.

We will set a new standard in CTV measurement by incorporating the Halo Effect reports in our dashboard. This helps understand the impact connected TV has for the customer journey. And lastly, we'd like to experiment in connected TV slot a pod bidding. And I don't mean the slots downstairs, but definitely testing this tactic to capture the audience first before the content is streamed.

And then we'd like to feature the demand gallery opportunities from our publisher, testing and piloting the Amazon Publisher services via Adobe AD Cloud.
