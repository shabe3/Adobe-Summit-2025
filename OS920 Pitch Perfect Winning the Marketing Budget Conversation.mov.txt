00:00:00:05 - 00:00:21:50

Winning the marketing budget conversation. And honestly, let's keep it real. Marketing is constantly fighting for budget. We're under scrutiny. We're always under the gun. We always have to prove our value. And I've been in too many conversations with executives where marketing budget is going. And what we're actually doing is we're trying to say, then why we need our budget.

00:00:21:50 - 00:00:49:07
不明
What is the budget used for? My name is Raja. I am CEO and founder of GW consulting. We're a strategic marketing operations agency, and this type of conversation is one that we've had way too many in the last couple of years. So in this session, what we're going to do is we're going to walk how we present and how we're going to shift the conversation of marketing budget from more of a defensive, reactive, you know, a reactive, standpoint to a more offensive or proactive standpoint.

00:00:49:18 - 00:01:11:16
不明
So we're not justifying spend as it's happening, but we're actually proving marketing's impact on revenue and on the long term growth perspective for my company. From a company standpoint, this is the framework that we released. And the key takeaways of this framework is how marketing impacts sales effectiveness, how client retention, how does it impact company goals and corporate initiatives.

00:01:11:16 - 00:01:27:36
不明
And those are the long term growth opportunities that we're talking about. That is the strategic go to market strategy. A corporate or a company have? Well, the short term goals are more how do we retain customers, how we onboard them? How do we make a better experience, and how do we enable sales to kind of better do their job?

00:01:27:41 - 00:01:51:53
不明
So some of these are short term and some are long term. And that's the biggest takeaway from this is how to separate that out between short term wins and long term impact. When we start with us, executives and marketing teams in general often focus on immediate returns. We want to show what is the immediate return that marketing has to offer, and that's kind of the scenario we play ourselves into.

00:01:51:58 - 00:02:10:31
不明
But marketing, my key goal also is to play has a long term strategic role in brand growth, positioning and retention. Retention nowadays is even more important than net new logos, which was a couple of years back. I think that was like everyone was trying to get new logos, show that, hey, these are the new companies that signed up.

00:02:10:43 - 00:02:30:29
不明
But now with the expansion of technology and depletion of market share, we have to do our best to make sure the customer experience is just as good as the onboarding experience. So how do we frame it. So we're going to use this tech. We're going to break it into a couple categories. There are short term wins. These are quick revenue impact items that affect pipeline go goals.

00:02:30:34 - 00:02:56:30
不明
Sales enablement. How affects the sales team. What marketing's doing for campaign attribution as far as client retention, long term growth. These are the strategic business items that companies focus on and more so what corporate initiatives focus on as well? In this slide, we're going to impact the short term goal. And that is how we enable the sales team to do their job better and to do their job more efficiently.

00:02:56:34 - 00:03:20:50
不明
What this slide helps you do is it draws a direct line of connection between campaigns that we're running and how the sales team is leveraging them, and that's the big difference. It's not so much about alignment, but it's more about collaboration between marketing and sales. We run these campaigns from a marketing tactical strategy perspective and how sales uses them to kind of have more efficient conversations.

00:03:20:55 - 00:03:43:25
不明
This helps you draw the line and compare campaign and sales performance from a collaborative standpoint, not an alignment number. We don't have to be aligned on the campaigns. We have to be aligned on what the campaign purposes are and how sales is going to use that campaign. So let's kind of start with a standard example. Everyone's done an ABM initiative.

00:03:43:27 - 00:04:04:31
不明
There's content, the strategy, there's lead nurture. There's a slew of things that marketing does. Well, if we look at this line, how does that tie into what sales is doing? And that's the conversation that needs to be had. It's not that we sent 500 quality leads. That is a required, required metric. You need to show that metric every single time, no matter what.

00:04:04:36 - 00:04:28:26
不明
However, what are they doing with those leads? When are they following up? How is it enabling sales to have better conversations? That's the purpose of this slide. The purpose is to show the impact that it's having on sales to have meaningful, meaningful conversations. So why don't we want to highlight immediate conversion rates and mql, because we have to do that anyway.

00:04:28:26 - 00:04:49:36
不明
That is a required report. What do we how do we show the relationship that sales is actually using the marketing strategy in the marketing campaigns for? Did it shorten the sales cycle? Did it measure engagement, and all of a sudden give sales an ability to have a conversation and develop a relationship? And how much of that pipeline revenue generated as a result of it?

00:04:49:41 - 00:05:19:20
不明
And that's why this slide kind of matters, is because there's two plays at any given time. Marketing doesn't anything there's two plays. There's a short term revenue impactful and there's a immediate proof of ROI. Then the second part is the long term benefits of it. The relationships that the sales are building, the relationship the customer has with the brand, the relationship that is being developed as a company, and how the company is portraying themselves to the customer as well.

00:05:19:25 - 00:05:44:10
不明
All of those things, while unmeasurable, are going to make an impact on long term growth and sustainability. One of the key areas of focus is that every company has, whether it's 2023 or 20 24 or 2025, and for for the foreseeable future, is client retention. You cannot have long term growth and sustainability without with clients churning. So how does marketing impact that?

00:05:44:10 - 00:06:07:47
不明
And most executives kind of see marketing is just kind of lead generation and enabling sales and qualifying lead and passing them to sales. Right. That's like 80% of the conversation that realistically occurs. But we as marketers, we need to also have this other conversation about how retention, customer success also plays a role in what marketing does. And that's what this slide is about.

00:06:07:52 - 00:06:31:27
不明
It's about customer onboarding success sequences, nurture campaigns, or even loyalty programs that help with that. So what did all of these customer focus campaigns that marketing ran for customers and clients, whatever you want to call them, what was the result of them? And let's not talk about that. There was engagement rates or that's not to talk about that.

00:06:31:27 - 00:07:02:50
不明
There was open rates or deliverability rate. Let's tie it to success. Did they renew? Did they were they up sold to higher tier products? Did that customer satisfaction improved? Did they end up staying engage longer? Did onboarding help them use your platform? If you're a SaaS SaaS company, easier and made the experience better, and if your services company just like us, did it help them understand what's the intention behind the services?

00:07:02:50 - 00:07:25:33
不明
Were those are the conversations that us as marketers need to have. Not, hey, we had X amount of people click on our link or open an email. What is the end all result? So if we're talking about customer success, we're talking about customer retention and customer longevity. And that's how we have to connected overall. Did these campaigns over time reduce the churn rate?

00:07:25:33 - 00:07:48:35
不明
Did you see an increase in renewals? Well, if that's the case, when a client closes and they become a customer, they get onboarded. At that point. It's the product and marketing that makes sure is when renewal comes, that renewal is happening. Sales once again, we're in. The sales cycle comes in either at the tail end of it or a couple months before it to make sure renewals are occurring.

00:07:48:39 - 00:08:14:04
不明
But there's a gap, and that gap is filled by marketing. And that's the conversation that we need to make sure that we portray. And very seldom times which, you know, in my experience, companies don't do that. Companies talk about renewals, but they don't talk about the gap of client before renewal. So did they did the churn rate reduce, how many customers came from renewals?

00:08:14:04 - 00:08:39:56
不明
What was the revenue amount tied to renewals? We don't get asked what the revenue amount is tied to renewals. We should be presenting them saying, hey, from a long term sustainability perspective, marketing campaigns increased customer success, which impacted renewals. And that is why the CLV, the customer lifetime value, is such an important metric for growing companies. Why does the slide matter?

00:08:39:56 - 00:09:16:09
不明
Why is this even here? Well, this is the transition. If sales and marketing are supposed to be aligned. And I always say that they need to collaborate more than alignment, when does short term turn into long term? This is your transition slide. If enabling the sales team is considered, managing activities and retaining customers are considered short term and long term activities, then this slide is why this slide is where we separate what marketing impacts on the short term, and how now it's starting to impact long term growth.

00:09:16:14 - 00:09:47:08
不明
And when we talk about long term growth, if you're a company that isn't investing time and understanding why that's important, you will constantly be trying to find. Net new clients to fill the void of clients or prospects or customers that are leaving. So as we shift from in demand, Gen enabling sales to retention, now let's talk about how marketing needs to prove to the company why what we're doing is a long term business necessity.

00:09:47:13 - 00:10:08:14
不明
Short term wins are important. No one's denying it. No one's denying that revenue is a bad thing. No one denies that it pays the bills. But how are you going to forecast and scale it and make it repeatable if you can, if you don't have a long term investment strategy. So how is marketing helping grow expansion and efficiency?

00:10:08:14 - 00:10:29:02
不明
What is the growth that the company had from last year and this year, last quarter, this quarter, how did the client onboarding increase? Did we go to market faster? The sales cycle get shorter? Why is that? It's not because sales is picking up the phone and dialing a lot faster, or having a 30 minute demo in 25 minutes.

00:10:29:02 - 00:10:57:26
不明
No, there's efficiencies and processes that marketing impact. Marketing does that impacts overall company growth. So are you now aligned to have that conversation with the leadership on the broader strategies that a company has? And if the answer is no, then this is where you need to make that relationship. And in this slide is where you need to make that relationship of how did marketing reduce customer acquisition cost?

00:10:57:26 - 00:11:19:08
不明
Because remember, there's a slew of activity that happens before someone raises their hand and wants to buy. There's a slew of activity that happens before a salesperson can have a meaningful conversation that results in a sale. What did marketing do? Data driven wise? We want to be data driven, but what did marketing do to make better business decisions?

00:11:19:23 - 00:11:39:10
不明
What did we invest in? What did we not invest in? What are those learnings? What is the impact of that from a scalable perspective, if you're not presenting that data, you're losing your budget. Simple as that. Right? Because if you if we focus marketing on a short term gain, you're always going to be expected to prove short term value.

00:11:39:15 - 00:11:59:50
不明
But what is the data telling you about better business decision making and customer acquisition costs from a long term growth perspective, how has brand building positioned the company in a long term market? Leadership. How do you separate yourself from that from your competition? It's not sales, right? Sales is in saying, calling more people and saying we're we're really good.

00:12:00:04 - 00:12:30:26
不明
They're supposed to do that. Marketing is what's separating and creating that identity of brand building, which is something that you cannot measure. You cannot attribute revenue to it, but you can reduce churn from clients because of it. And that's why this slide is probably one of the heavier transition slides. To start talking about the short term gains that we've kind of narrowed and funnel ourselves into, and now focus on long term strategy and long term growth.

00:12:30:26 - 00:12:48:36
不明
This is how marketing is aligned with company goals. So in this slide essentially what you kind of want to do is you want to say what are the company goals. What are you trying to achieve. Are you trying to increase your market share? Are you trying to get that new logos? Are you trying to reduce customer acquisition costs?

00:12:48:36 - 00:13:11:05
不明
Are you increasing the lifetime value of the client? If all of those things are true? These are all the things that marketing has done to impact those. And once again, it's a UN measurable relationship because short term is measured, measurable, long term is sustainable, and growth. And that's what we have to identify. Now let's bring all of this together.

00:13:11:10 - 00:13:42:37
不明
We've talked about company goals. We've talked about how marketing impacts sales and just makes them makes their job a lot easier. We've talked about how it impacts customer success and the customer retention team to help reduce churn. So now what is driving all of these change. Right. And a lot of this is because of corporate initiatives. Whether you have a board member or you're part of a board that manages the company, or you just have an executive team that manages it, there's a couple things that they care about at the highest level which drives all of this.

00:13:42:41 - 00:13:58:57
不明
One is it dictates where company is going to invest. Are you a company that were part of an acquisition, or are you merging with a company or are acquiring a company? We're going to look at all of the long term growth and brand building portion of that, as well. How do we expand and how do we prioritize growth?

00:13:59:01 - 00:14:18:09
不明
That's what they're going to be in charge, and that's what they're going to be looking for. When they talk about investment strategies, when they talk about mergers, acquisitions, whether they talk about the success of a company or when to expand into a new market. So what we want to kind of try to do with this slide, and this is a very, very high level slide.

00:14:18:16 - 00:14:39:40
不明
And this is where the long term kind of fits into from a growth perspective, long term growth is based off on the success of a company hitting their goals. In order for a company to hit their goals, sales has to do a good job. We have to retain customers and we have to present the brand cohesively, and that's what corporate level initiatives are all about.

00:14:39:45 - 00:15:08:48
不明
So how has marketing played a role in that? While brand building for one, all of the company goals, has marketing helped position the company as an industry leader? Absolutely. PR campaigns, website, website analysis, even outbound outbound campaigns releases to the market. All of those are key. And all of those are elements of campaigns and marketing controls and ones that impact this level of initiative.

00:15:08:53 - 00:15:28:36
不明
And ultimately, are all these campaigns driving top funnel awareness? Everything that we do drop drives, drop on awareness from a long term perspective. So we have to be able to tie in. If the corporation wants to do all of these things, or the executive team wants to expand into marketing, when is the best time to do it well?

00:15:28:36 - 00:15:52:53
不明
What percentage of the total company revenue is realistically marketing influence? And the answer is a lot because if you think about it, there's everything that we've talked about at some point in time. Marketing has helped to or marketing has helped lead. And that's where marketing efforts have increased brand equity, which has led to the long term market dominance that companies experience.

00:15:52:58 - 00:16:21:35
不明
So how is marketing helping leadership future proof that business by doing all of those things. And this is what this slide demonstrates and demonstrates how we're future proofing the business from activities that are not short term, but long term focused. And this is where the big picture comes into place. If you look at it, marketing efforts to corporate initiatives impact company goals, and that's where it trickles down to all of the things that we said.

00:16:21:35 - 00:16:41:22
不明
I kind of take for granted from a marketing perspective, usually by the time we get to the slide, the leadership sees marketing as a strategic function. They don't see it as a and I hate using this term or cost center because we are both we are cost and profit center. Depending on who work impact you, we're impacting the sales team.

00:16:41:37 - 00:16:58:52
不明
We have to be a profit center. We have to make sure our campaigns resonate and give and empower sales. Something to talk about. If it's customer retention, we have to make sure all the campaigns that we're doing are talking about the customer experience and building the brand. So we reduce churn when we get to this portion of it.

00:16:59:00 - 00:17:24:42
不明
This is where generally people say, well, that's a cost, that's a cost, and ultimately it is a cost just like any other department that is at a company level. It's how we present our cost in relationship to these initiatives. And that's what this kind of exercise helps us to. So how do we win the budget conversation? And honestly, at the end of the day, securing your marketing budget isn't about defending it.

00:17:24:48 - 00:17:54:36
不明
It is about proving strategic value. The more proactive we can be, the better it is for us. Because when we do that, we turn expense the conversation of expense, I should say, into investment. We don't give vanity metrics, but we give business metrics that align the corporate KPIs, and we shift the narrative from just looking at us as short term producers or short term wins to long term growth.

00:17:54:41 - 00:18:14:54
不明
If we are reactive in it, then we always will be put into a kind of a scenario where we have to show, the expense, what we can cut, what our short term wins. But if we're proactively making sure that we're painting the biggest picture possible from short term and long term, that's when we own the budget conversation.

00:18:15:07 - 00:18:34:25
不明
And that's when we back it up with data driven insights. So kind of what next steps right. So use this deck. It's going to be available for download. Use it in your budget discussions. We've done it plenty of times in the last year since we released this framework. It helps paint a picture of short term versus long term customize it with your own data.

00:18:34:27 - 00:18:58:24
不明
You know, practice shifting the narrative of hey, we're a cost center and a profit center, but this is where our cost and profit are helpful, not just trying to justify and defend our cost, but control the conversation. And when we do that, then we're going to be able to control the budget conversation a little bit more clearly. So next time you know, when the leadership asked what's the ROI of marketing?

00:18:58:24 - 00:19:32:23
不明
We don't have an answer. We don't are not scrambling to get data metrics. We're not scrambling to prove our value. We have everything, and we show them proof across the picture that talks to the leadership level, but it also talks in a short term game level as well. This is, this conversation is something that, we've been involved in very heavily for the last couple of years, mainly because, a lot of the shifting budget conversations and proving marketing's revenue impact and balancing short term, is just at the core, a very simple explanation.

00:19:32:23 - 00:19:51:57
不明
And marketing isn't just a cost center, it's a business driver. So it's not a measure of cost versus profit center. It's where does marketing fit into the picture and align with business goals? At a long term growth and a short term growth perspective? And people have people come to ask like, how do we kind of use this framework?

00:19:51:57 - 00:20:17:24
不明
Like where do we start? Right. So the immediate impact, that's pretty easy. We do this on a day to day basis and quarterly basis, monthly basis. Whenever your KPI reports are do that sales and client slides. Right. So the quick wins. That's the revenue influence attribution. You know conversations tie marketing to long term business growth. So there are campaigns for customers that we're doing that connect to corporate priorities.

00:20:17:38 - 00:20:37:57
不明
And then what are those corporate initiatives? How do we want to impact them. And if you don't know what they are I would find out. And that is how you can relate everything that you're doing. One main thing that we want to walk away with is you have to own the internal narrative. When we have budget conversations, we can't report on numbers that are meaningless.

00:20:37:57 - 00:20:58:36
不明
We have to report, on numbers that impact short term and then tell the story of how it's fueling business growth quarter over quarter, year over year, whatever. You know, your reporting kind of cadences. So customize the framework, use it in your meetings, control your narrative and enjoy. Summit. Come say hi. We're going to be at booth 679.

00:20:58:36 - 00:21:10:03
不明
I hope this session gave you some practical insights on how we've been able to help control the conversation of budget. So it's not like, hey, now you have to cut your tech stack. So thank you everyone for tuning in and enjoy the rest of summit.
