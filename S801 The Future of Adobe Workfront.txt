00:00:00:12 - 00:00:27:00
不明
We're excited to be with you this afternoon. As you probably saw from this slide, this is not the online session. Even though that's the session number, that's up here. So, you're in person, so that's awesome. How's everybody doing? Okay, that didn't do that didn't go too well. How's everybody doing? There we go.

00:00:27:05 - 00:00:49:49
不明
What is your shirt say? Say la vie. I love it. So, by way of quick introduction, I'm Richard Whitehead. I'm the director of product marketing for Work Front. I'm joined by Paul Von. You want to introduce yourself? Sure. I'm Paul von, head of product, for work front. And just excited to be here and talk with you about where we're going with this amazing product.

00:00:49:50 - 00:01:13:35
不明
So are you excited about that? Wait, wait. She's super loud. Yeah. And I don't have a good arm, you know. We've done a lot of fun things over the years with work front. If you've been part of our family, which I consider you all family, we've done some fun things over the years. We've given away a vest, we've, all kinds of crazy things.

00:01:13:35 - 00:01:34:19
不明
And this year, with these lions, I think it's probably been the most, that anybody's wanted. One of our, staff members almost lost an eye today. So, please be kind in the booth. We're going to talk about the future of work front. I'm going to give kind of an upfront, discussion about the future of work front.

00:01:34:24 - 00:01:56:49
不明
Some of this you've already heard about before and the. In the world of work. The world of work is constantly changing. We know that things are. We're adapting to, being out of the office, being in the office. I got to go back to the office. I got to work from home. Talking to one of my colleagues today, they have, like, three houses across the US that they spend different times in those different places.

00:01:56:54 - 00:02:22:33
不明
And so work is changing. Work is evolving. My 13 year old daughter does different things than I used to do it at that age, and she's doing her homework with her mobile phone, and I think she's texting and getting mad at her because she's over there moving her thumbs a million miles an hour. But we're having to deal with all of those challenges across our organizations, whether it be age differences, whether it be work styles.

00:02:22:33 - 00:02:41:15
不明
All of that is changing as we go into this session. This is the slide I always don't really like, but just know that we're going to be talking about the future of work front, which means we're going to be talking about capabilities that are coming in, the product that aren't there yet. Some of these screens are simulated. Okay.

00:02:41:20 - 00:03:01:59
不明
So just like in your mirror, some of these objects are closer than they appear. That's the same thing of the slides that we're going to show today. So like I said, I'm going to take you through a few things up front. And then Paul will take us through some of those core capabilities of planning and workflow, and then I'll finish it out, for the session.

00:03:02:03 - 00:03:23:47
不明
All right. So let's kind of dive into this. I just realized I didn't click the little button to tell me, like, start. Okay. So one of the biggest problems, of course, as marketers, as anybody in any organization, we have to create content at massive scale. And if you think about content, content can be a lot of different things.

00:03:23:52 - 00:03:46:21
不明
For some organizations, that's really flashy fliers or banner ads and those kinds of things. For some of our financial partners, that could be a mortgage application, right? It could be a schematic. I come from an engineering background, and where I worked before, schematics were considered content. So when we talk about assets and content, we're talking about all of those types of things.

00:03:46:25 - 00:04:10:49
不明
If you think about it in this case, with a physical goods like in a retail store or, Paul used to work for one of these kind of organizations where he's producing jackets and fly fly rods and tell us where you work, Paul, before the Orvis L.L.Bean lands and all that. So all the cool companies and the cool companies I worked for, ones that weren't quite so cool.

00:04:10:54 - 00:04:37:08
不明
But you have products, right? And maybe you have eight different products. Those products quickly grow as you have to get them into different channels. Some of those channels are virtual. Some of those channels are physical. And you quickly start seeing here, I've got 120 different assets that I'm worried about. If you're a global company, like most of you are, you have multiple languages that you have to support, and then you add on to that different variations of that content.

00:04:37:13 - 00:04:58:42
不明
Look how quickly this is adding up. I'm a math minor. And so if you think about these in factorial it grows very very quickly. And so in this case we're at 100 or 12,600 assets. But you usually do more like ten variations. And then you have to get them out into the market and refresh them. And it's maybe three times a year.

00:04:58:42 - 00:05:23:23
不明
And that quarterly or, or every 3 or 6 months that you're putting that out. But more than likely you're doing them every single month. Look how quickly we've gone from eight to almost half a million. And I'll bet you that that's not even close to what you're doing, because you probably have even more than that. This explosion of content isn't slowing down.

00:05:23:28 - 00:05:46:29
不明
When I was first in the industry, I had a hard drive, and I thought it was so big, you know? Anybody have one of those? Right? The hard drive could never be filled up, right? And guess what it did. I think even Bill gates said something like, you're never going to need more than 126 K of memory, right?

00:05:46:34 - 00:06:14:38
不明
Look at this. 47 exabytes in 2021 has grown to 155 exabytes, which is stunning, right? To think about all of that content. And because it's not slowing down, we literally are in a content crisis because we're not able to keep up. And so I refer to this as the spaghetti slide. Right. Part of my background is in architecture.

00:06:14:43 - 00:06:40:11
不明
I remember in architecture they said, don't don't be you're right. It's all good. I want to make sure. But you didn't build the sidewalks first. You just let people walk where they're supposed to go, and then you put a sidewalk there. The problem with that, of course, is people walk over. They want, and you don't get a common path if you're not part of an organization for a long period of time.

00:06:40:16 - 00:07:02:09
不明
The traditional or tribal knowledge that people have, it's hard to know. So, Paul, how long have you been here at Adobe? Six weeks. Six weeks? It's funny, though. I don't tell anybody. Just yesterday said it was. I'm supposed to know what I'm talking about. Richard. Paul actually a phenomenal. He, used to be a customer of work front as well.

00:07:02:14 - 00:07:31:41
不明
So he doesn't have all the tribal knowledge about all the different people he needs to talk to. That happens with us all the time. And organizational part of the organization changes or a process changes. All of this creates chaos. It creates this content crisis. And when that happens, guess what? Things break. Low adherence to brand standards. Right. Something comes out and Richard thinks he's really cool.

00:07:31:41 - 00:07:53:20
不明
And I got Firefly. So guess what? I'm going to put a a lion on a rocket going to the moon. And that's our new campaign. What does creative think? Now that's not our new campaign. Because I have the tools, I think that I can take the brand and do whatever I want with it. That's not what you want with your content.

00:07:53:24 - 00:08:11:00
不明
Other things happen where you have something like time consuming reviews and approvals. What do you think the average number of reviews an asset goes through? The average number of reviews for an asset is over 20.

00:08:11:05 - 00:08:40:11
不明
Just think about that. An asset goes into the system and it gets reviewed 20 different times. My goodness. Like talk about a waste of time. Isn't there a better way? And there is. And we're going to show you. All right. And if this not enough, there's even more pain to the organization. Disjointed and execution within internal and external teams, manual and fragmented workflows.

00:08:40:11 - 00:09:06:16
不明
So what used to feel like it's really going smoothly all of a sudden just comes to a screeching stop because there's some sort of manual process. One of the companies I worked for not too long ago still had job jackets. Oh yeah. She's like, I don't know if everyone heard that. Oh my gosh. Yeah. Difficulty aligning plans and execution of those plans and even technology roadblocks.

00:09:06:16 - 00:09:30:19
不明
Right. How many, who thinks they have the most martech tools in their stack as she, she's talking about, like they submitted this cool artwork of all their martech stack, and it looks really cool, but guess what? It's hard to use because I've got to jump all over the place, and so that creates that challenge. We don't use 50% or more of the assets that we create.

00:09:30:20 - 00:10:06:28
不明
We don't use 50% or more of the of the technology that we buy. There's a better way. And that better way is moving from disconnected plans to centralized plans, moving from this chaotic work process to streamlined workflows and holistic views of what's happening in the organization, what's in flight, moving from latent and time consuming reviews and approvals to things where we can do it in a unified way, where it becomes more smooth and so we don't have to track down people, in some cases, literally in the restroom.

00:10:06:33 - 00:10:36:34
不明
Right. Manual workflows can that we have here can be prioritized and integrated with the rest of those systems. And AI is going to play a fundamental part in this journey. So guess where it all starts? Starts with a plan. Okay. I'm a boomer. Admit it. A lot of boomer humor I could lay out on you. Back in my day.

00:10:36:47 - 00:10:56:19
不明
That's how you know it's good boomer humor. We had planners. Anybody have a planner? They're cool. Right? Go to the store, you get your letter planner. You got the stuff that was inside it. My wife had one that was all flowers. And you know, I was looking for the one that was Star Wars, but they didn't have one.

00:10:56:24 - 00:11:22:16
不明
Right. But you had different inserts. Guess what? Everybody plans. So what I want to make sure you understand is that planning is not a unique process for a limited group of people. It's for everybody. Okay. And so it starts with centralizing, planning and optimizing those workflows. We see this. And I know this is a little bit Pollyanna. And you're seeing it here from a super split.

00:11:22:17 - 00:11:42:40
不明
You know it's like when I get my Christmas tree lights out at the beginning of, you know, December, they're usually all tangled up. And, you know, that was the chaos. And then I get it all stretched out. Nice. So strategy and planning, being able to work through those processes. Then it goes into work execution. Who's going to do the work?

00:11:42:40 - 00:12:05:30
不明
How is it going to be done? And then finally delivering that content. If you didn't get a chance to listen to Hilary from Marriott, I highly encourage you to go back and listen to the keynote. There's also a session later today that, some of the people on our team are going to talk about one of the phase, phrases that she used us from intake to in market.

00:12:05:35 - 00:12:34:57
不明
And I love that. And that's what you need to be thinking about in this process. We tied tightly into Adobe Gen Studio, into the content supply chain. We're in fact, the first pillar that you see there in workflow and planning. And that workflow on planning leads to those other pieces the creation and production, asset management, the activation and reporting and insights all layered into this gen studio foundation.

00:12:35:02 - 00:12:57:38
不明
There's another session that was given about Gen Studio, and the cool part about Gen Studio Foundation is now all these technologies can have a common interface, a common way to interact with the applications. Things like brand service can be surfaced in gen studio foundations so that every single application and pillar can use that. There are modules for very bespoke use cases.

00:12:57:38 - 00:13:23:08
不明
So and in the case of Gen Studio for performance marketing this is for paid media. So getting information out into LinkedIn or other paid media channels. We're coming out with creative production and scaled content and social. And all of that is underpinned with these AI platforms with this AI foundation. And I'm going to talk about how that comes into work front.

00:13:23:13 - 00:13:46:11
不明
So before I turn it over to Paul. Really important for you to realize work front. And when I think it was three years ago, looking at Loren, where as Loren, there she is. Like when Loren was up here 2 or 3 years ago, she had a slide that kind of showed the line from a, a Cub kind of growing up.

00:13:46:15 - 00:14:14:26
不明
We're pride now. We have a whole big family. And so that pride is building the marketing or the operational system of record. Isn't it sad that we have systems of record for pretty much everything we have finance systems of record. We have HR systems of record, but we don't have work systems of record. Why are most important asset and organization are people and the work that they do.

00:14:14:31 - 00:14:46:50
不明
So we should be tracking that. And that's what work front helps you do. It's three distinct but connected capability is planning, centralized planning centralized campaign management workflow execution of the work, the stuff that you're using today and in a heavy basis for things like reviewing approval or resource planning and then automation and integration so that you can pull in other sources, other applications, or automate that process through the entire work channel.

00:14:46:55 - 00:15:12:46
不明
Now, underpinning all of that, of course, is the Adobe applications, but it's also enterprise scale. It's secure, it's reliable. It's all the things you would expect from Adobe. So with that, let's dive into the first pillar, which is planning, and I'll turn it over to Paul. Thanks, Richard. Okay, so, what we're talking about is building a marketing system of record and planning is that first pillar.

00:15:12:59 - 00:15:34:01
不明
So let's dive in just a little bit. Nice animation. Richard. That's that's really cool there. Okay, but before we do I want to talk about the challenges. And I want to see some head nodding and maybe some T-shirt tossing or dancing. Okay. So these are the challenges. We went over that spaghetti slide. We talk about the complexity of your work is ever increasing.

00:15:34:01 - 00:16:00:13
不明
If you're in any type of role that has anything to do with marketing, I think many of you are here in that role. Some are creative, some are operations. You know, you feel this increasing in a in a big way. So the chaos of orchestrating that is is just out of control. And it's creating disparate teamwork. Creating silos is creating a lot of dysfunction in your in your teams and in your operations.

00:16:00:17 - 00:16:17:58
不明
And it's very difficult to be able to bring all that you need to bring to together your channels, your campaigns and all that to make to make that happen. So who's feeling some of this? Anybody? Right. Oh, not very many. Oh, yeah. All of you. I just want to point out though, like we were rolling up these shirts and we're like creativity.

00:16:18:03 - 00:16:40:28
不明
We found the coffee sleeves, and then we had the brand. Is it in work? Front stickers. How about that? I think it's pretty cool. We were very proud of ourself. So if you're ever looking, if you're looking for, like something to do for a craft or something. Yeah, I'm going to put them on Etsy. So they're going to be the stickers are at the booth.

00:16:40:33 - 00:16:58:15
不明
Yes. We started talking tossing stickers. It just gets weird, you know, it's like snowflakes. So we're not gonna do that. Okay. So let's keep going. The other challenges, there's the lack of visibility. You don't know where the work stands. You have no idea. Or maybe you do, but it causes you to be checking and rechecking and jumping and finding people in the bathroom.

00:16:58:15 - 00:17:19:53
不明
Was that the example? Hey, where's my thing you were going to get done for me? The lack of physically now. There's lots and lots of tools on the market. We just talked about the marketing stack that you have. There's a ton of tools in the market. You can use them. They're not connected generally speaking. And so you have to figure out how am I going to take information from here and get it here, and then find out what's over there.

00:17:19:53 - 00:17:35:07
不明
And then have that circle back around over to the first, whatever it might be. And she needs a t shirt, by the way, because she was brave enough to raise her hand about her marketing stack right there. And they gave a t shirt over to you. Oh, you got it. Okay. No, w no no, w okay, so they're fragmented.

00:17:35:07 - 00:17:59:05
不明
Disconnected. So we all agree we have challenges in this space. So what I want to talk about is why centralized plan management. Now we're talking about providing a holistic view of all of your content and your projects and your campaign. So what does that mean? So when you start with a marketing system of record a single source of truth, this is where you can build all of your, content plans, all of your taxonomies.

00:17:59:05 - 00:18:18:03
不明
You can come together and agree upon what you're going to call something. What are the personas called? What are the products called? And you're going to be able to make that happen. So you gonna be able to unite and then govern across all of planning and execution, even into automation. And then finally in analyzing that data. Okay. So let's show you a little bit of what this looks like.

00:18:18:17 - 00:18:35:17
不明
So records are created in planning. And by the way this is 30,000ft. So if you want more we're going to have you go to the booth to talk a little bit more because we're gonna move very fast. You're able to sort and find and filter specifically for what you're looking for, and all because of that, data was determined in the very beginning.

00:18:35:21 - 00:18:53:14
不明
Now, if you want a little more information in that planning table, which moves very quickly past there, you can click that and you can find your brief right there. So this is all in planning. Did you see this yesterday in that in the keynote. Was it amazing planning? Was the red thread through all of that planning made all of that happen.

00:18:53:14 - 00:19:11:43
不明
So if you're if you're not a planning customer, your work front customer, you're just you're maybe planning curious. Let's let's talk and let's, let's get you, into a situation where this can fundamentally change how your approach in your marketing system of record. Steve, where are you? Here. Steve. Okay. This is the mastermind behind planning, so he's,

00:19:11:55 - 00:19:29:57
不明
He's pretty amazing. Of course. Of course, a lot of other people involved, but, but but planning is his, and it's just a really amazing tool. Now, I want to talk about in just a few minutes where we're going with that. Okay. So, building on the launch of planning, which took place last year, we're bringing some more things together.

00:19:29:58 - 00:19:57:05
不明
Now, remember, this is a roadmap. Although we have pretty great line of sight to all of these things. So we're really bringing, greater, continuity between planning and workflow or what you, what we might be calling work front, legacy. I don't know if I call it that or not, but but the core. Yeah. We're providing better ways to contextually flow from one planning campaign into the the creation and linking all those projects.

00:19:57:08 - 00:20:16:25
不明
So that's all happening. And then finally, there's more automation services coming to help you. And this is something that, that we are looking forward to, very, very soon. Okay. I'm not going to say any questions, but I want to do that. Not yet. Or did we talk about questions? Did not. Let's talk about just a really quick question.

00:20:16:33 - 00:20:33:12
不明
We're not going to be taking questions in here, such a large room. And we're going to have a time. We want to invite you down to the booth. All of our experts are down there. They're going to answer in deep dive. They've got tons of demos to be able to show you. So head down there. Okay, so now we talked a little bit about the the sauce if you will, for the metadata.

00:20:33:26 - 00:20:58:46
不明
So we we look at planning as and our developing this metadata service. So it becomes your single source of truth. And those records now campaigns products and other other aspects can be found inside of Gen Studio for performance marketing. They can be found in assets and in in sites. But this becomes that repository for that metadata service.

00:20:58:50 - 00:21:18:08
不明
So essentially centrally managing those okay. So this a little, a little deeper dive into those campaigns, the products and the personas. So, you, you get to see this, this is exposed in, Gen Studio for performance marketing, and you're able to find all of that, metadata that you that you started off in this in planning.

00:21:18:13 - 00:21:27:46
不明
And you'll be able to see some of it here, to, to be able to capture that context when you're, when you're working in those particular tools.

00:21:27:51 - 00:21:52:53
不明
Okay. So let's move on to, work flow the second pillar, if you will, of your marketing system of record, the core of execution. Okay. So when we talk about the streamlined execution for, all projects and campaigns, this is what we mean in, in workflow. So, well, I'm, I'm just gonna I'm not gonna ask the question, but in this room, we have, work front champions.

00:21:52:58 - 00:22:05:44
不明
We have people who've been at work for for a long time, and we have a lot of people who are work front, curious, so they don't know a lot about it. And they're here. We've we've taken a lot of questions at the booth about what what is this thing and how can I use it. So we have a we have a lot of people in this room.

00:22:05:55 - 00:22:29:34
不明
So I just want to kind of give an overview what we're talking about. So connected workflows allow the strategy definition and the project kickoff to happen all the way through execution. And out to reporting. So it's streamlining that faster time to market and, fewer deadlines are missed. All of that's happening right here in that workflow for execution.

00:22:29:38 - 00:22:53:42
不明
This helps me. I don't want to crush that. Okay. Thank you. So this is what it looks like here. So I was able to go in to look at all of our campaigns. We can filter look at all what's at risk and be able to get all of our information looking right into the project. Being able to comment, to make updates right there inside of workflow.

00:22:53:43 - 00:23:16:24
不明
So this is this is just a little quick overview of what's happening there okay. So let's talk about what's coming in workflow. We know that the work work front and workflow part of work front has served project managers really well for a long time. We're going to dive into some, more things on priorities in just a minute.

00:23:16:29 - 00:23:36:35
不明
But what is coming are and you saw this a little bit was more AI capabilities than we've had before. So we talked about the project health advisor, the copilot, and, Richard's going to talk a little more of that in just just a second. We're expanding our canvas dashboards to make our reporting more robust and to round trip what you're doing with your campaigns.

00:23:36:40 - 00:23:56:16
不明
In a in a better way, so you can see exactly how things are performing, where you're on track, where you're off track and making that happen. There's a, universal approval review and approvals that we're launching, this year that allows, that same interface to work no matter where you are in that, content supply chain ecosystem.

00:23:56:21 - 00:24:17:02
不明
We're working on more financial and resource management, features that will be coming. And we can talk a little bit more about that. And then also Azure in May. So that's coming as well. Okay. So like we said a little bit earlier, we, we have been serving the project manager for a long time, and we still are.

00:24:17:06 - 00:24:35:45
不明
But the feedback that we got was sometimes that's a little more complex. And what an individual contributor wants to see a little too much maybe at once. Now, project managers love all of that detail. They'd love to have that and that, but that can be often too much to to work with, with an AI scene. So last year we launched priorities.

00:24:35:49 - 00:24:54:22
不明
And you can see you're able to come in and just see what is important to you to get your work done fast, so you don't have to click through and dive in a whole bunch to make that happen now. So it's, really quick to be able to see exactly what you need. But sometimes people say, well, that's great, and thank you.

00:24:54:34 - 00:25:12:55
不明
This was our number one piece of feedback, by the way. Priorities. But I do want to get some more details. And so you can see there and they go back and you can see there and we've added this right rail so you can get the details very quickly of what you're looking for. As a as individual contributor, very quick, very fast and easy.

00:25:13:00 - 00:25:33:58
不明
Now, how many you love a good list. A lot of list makers in this room, I think so, yeah. Hallelujah for the list. Right. Okay, but not everybody likes a list, so. So we wanted to introduce another way to look at your work. And so that's what calendars are doing a calendars. You can, you can, kind of give your own styling and customize that.

00:25:34:03 - 00:25:58:10
不明
And some people just love to, to see it in that way. So we've made that available to you, now in work phone and in the priorities. Okay. So how many of you like to work? 365 days a year? 24 seven. Love it. One guy. Don't give him a t shirt. No, no, no, we take work off, right?

00:25:58:10 - 00:26:11:29
不明
We love to. We love to work hard. And then we love to play hard. And then we come back. Now, did the work stop while you were gone? There never seems to I don't I haven't had that happen. You get back and you're just like, oh my gosh, I got to get caught up. I got to know what I need.

00:26:11:33 - 00:26:29:30
不明
What's most important? What are the insights I need to know? Where are things at risk when needed to do? So we've added this Catch Me Up feature that allows you to go in and say, okay, well, what is most important for me to focus on and be able to get right back to the work that matters fast. So really, really fun.

00:26:29:35 - 00:26:47:11
不明
Okay, so now we also know and have heard that people like to organize their work. Imagine that goes back to that old planner days with your where you like to put things in the buckets that we want. So now we've made groupings or prioritization buckets. We call them and you can go in and prioritize how you want to work.

00:26:47:11 - 00:27:05:10
不明
So making that work make more sense to you and everyone's individual. So however you want to do that and drag and drop organize however you want to make that happen. Again, this is all about making that, helping that individual contributor on your team be able to work faster and smarter and get to what they need to get to.

00:27:05:15 - 00:27:23:26
不明
Okay. We also know that in order for an individual contributor to be successful, they've got to have the assets that are part of their project. So it could be documents, it could be do proofing, it could be things. Now we have those documents readily available to you. And you can we can work with larger uploads than we have before.

00:27:23:31 - 00:27:46:39
不明
And it's all real time. So it's under real time present. So you're not thinking before I start back from my vacation, before I start, do I have what I need to make this happen? And there's no need, no need to refresh anymore. So they're just all there in real time presents, which is exciting. Now. Also, not all of us love to write, really complex filter, schemas or whatever you want to call them, to be able to make that happen.

00:27:46:39 - 00:28:05:08
不明
And so now we can use smart filters, using AI to be able to be able to help us speak in a natural language and type in a natural language and to say, let's see, show me late tasks and then have those appear and make that happen. So no complexity again, just very easy to make that happen.

00:28:05:13 - 00:28:24:20
不明
Okay. So that was rapid. That was 50,000ft. I probably skipped a bunch of stuff in my notes. Forgive me. Like I said, we have experts at the booth. We have one more pillar that we want to talk about, and that's really in the automation and integration space. I'm going to hand it back over to Richard. Okay. I'm going to put this back back on the remote.

00:28:24:20 - 00:28:46:14
不明
I don't know, I got really wild with the remote I guess. Yeah. There we go. In fact, on the back of this shirt, what does it say? Say it louder. There we go. Work smart, play hard like we don't. We don't want to work hard. We want to work smarter. Right. And so that's why this on the t shirt.

00:28:46:14 - 00:29:10:57
不明
So I'm going to throw it over here. We didn't didn't even go for a coffee mug. That one. I wanted you to dive. And it can go for. We don't want to hurt anybody. All right? So amazing, amazing things that we're doing, obviously, in planning and workflow that plan tied to the workflow. And how do you get all of that together through automation and integration.

00:29:11:02 - 00:29:35:32
不明
Right. There's a lot of things that we can use for automation. We can use scripts. We can use, I pass tools, right? We can use APIs, we can use native integrations. Right. And so with work front, it's really important that you understand that we can do all of those things. And what's the value there.

00:29:35:37 - 00:30:02:26
不明
Let me just quickly describe that. If I'm integrating with work front and if I'm an engineer and I love APIs, then you can tie in directly with our APIs. And we're constantly refreshing those and making them better so that you can integrate with third party tools. Problem of course, with the API integration is if Richard goes away and I don't have that skill set anymore, guess what happens to this integration?

00:30:02:31 - 00:30:27:32
不明
What happens to the integration? All right. What happens is the integration. Yeah. Goes away. Someone needs to line over here though. Yes. Sisters like it was yelling out over there I like it I like it. Yeah. So it goes away. Right. And so they become a little bit fragile. The next layer of integration, as I mentioned, is native now native integrations.

00:30:27:32 - 00:30:54:34
不明
We're going to build those. We're going to build those native integrations for other Adobe applications. Why? Because we're Adobe right. You would expect that. And so we have native integrations for assets and some of those applications, that are in the stack there. Excuse me I'm like 13 again, third party integrations are built through fusion. Right. So many of you use fusion.

00:30:54:34 - 00:31:19:55
不明
So those third party integrations, maybe you're integrating with Salesforce. Maybe you're integrating with other CRM application use fusion because instead of the APIs, we're taking care of all that work for you. And we have literally hundreds of connectors now, including connectors into Adobe applications. Now, the fourth one that I'm going to talk about is App Builder. Anybody use App Builder before.

00:31:20:00 - 00:31:46:01
不明
Nobody. So from a UI extensibility perspective. So if you're within work front and you want to have the ability to show that application's interface within the context of work front, previously when we didn't integrate with Adobe, shell you to deny frame right. You could put an iframe inside a work front in the new World that's much more secure and scalable.

00:31:46:06 - 00:32:04:30
不明
You have to use App Builder to encapsulate or create that extensibility. So we have four ways to integrate. Do we any other vendors do that? Shake your head like this. No. And by the way, work happens on more than Monday.

00:32:04:35 - 00:32:37:01
不明
Somebody got it. You got it. All right okay. So automating that end to end process becomes super critical. Those processes need to be simple. They need to be fast. Right. And I can leverage AI to generate those types of things, such as campaign briefs that you saw in the keynote yesterday or to automate resource assignments. So one of our customers that probably all of us have visited their parks, automates that process.

00:32:37:01 - 00:32:55:26
不明
So when intake comes in, they automate it down the stream to be able to say, I know what template to use and I know who to assign it to, and all of that can be done in an automated way, automating those handoffs so that as you go down in that process, remember the spaghetti slide, right? You don't want to be a slide.

00:32:55:26 - 00:33:23:54
不明
You don't want it to stop here and then say, I hope somebody picks this up, right? No. You want to automate that through the entire process. And so we have native integrations for some of that I talked about Am assets, how many assets customers out there. Yeah. Needs to be more. And here's why. Because assets what do we say is the crisis.

00:33:23:59 - 00:33:56:53
不明
What's the crisis that we're faced with. Content the asset. Guess what. We integrate best with Am assets. Content is king. Context is God. Okay. Because context adds all of those things to the rest of the system. And so integrating work throughout with an assets provides much more automation, much more AI capabilities of the things that you saw in the keynote, but also things that, like Marriott's doing.

00:33:56:57 - 00:34:18:11
不明
So here you can map metadata, everything, asset metadata. My favorite shirt I'm a metal head. So you've seen the metadata sticker. Do we have some of those at the booth. We don't okay. Michigan's like no don't talk about that. I have a few of my bags. So if you're really nice to me, I'll give you a metadata sticker.

00:34:18:15 - 00:34:46:26
不明
But metadata becomes that backbone. And Paul talked about that. And being able to take that metadata that you're working on a project and the assets assigned to that project, that data can flow with the asset. How much did it cost? What system was it built in, what channel is it being put in and connecting that across even multiple Am instances with that native connector as part of the roadmap?

00:34:46:31 - 00:35:12:19
不明
We're in agreement with Jesse or for performance marketing. So why is this cool? So take a look at this. I am literally coming in in performance marketing. I'm going to prove something that I've created with Firefly. And I immediately send that request on, and I can send it off to approval. Now, Jason Baron, why don't you stand up here for a second?

00:35:12:28 - 00:35:40:07
不明
I'm calling him out. This is Jason's baby, so he's down at the booth like this stuff kind of pulling across all of these different surfaces. Because review and approval should be a common way to interact with the system. Right? So here the review and approval can be fairly basic which sensitive for performance marketing. But then you can pull it through into advanced flows of the approval.

00:35:40:07 - 00:36:08:56
不明
So additional context that you want to do markup. The proof can be done right and work front. And so that tailored feedback gets built in which sensitive for performance marketing multi-stage reviews and the planning data. Remember I talked about this before. Planning is not just for planners. Say it with me. Planning is not just for planners.

00:36:09:01 - 00:36:36:44
不明
Planning is for everybody. And everybody plans. And so having that plan then show up here in just for performance marketing. That's why you see people get so excited about that metadata and pulling that through, whether it's campaigns, products, personas, review and approval, these are all basic services that come from work front. And then you can extend them with the work front system.

00:36:36:49 - 00:37:03:51
不明
Next Am sites, which got a couple of people really excited. These guys are like, oh, it's like okay, yeah. So this one I'm also very excited about. So initially we're coming out with Aim sites integration. It's mostly about seeing your tasks within sites. And we know that's not enough. And so there's more that's coming soon. Kickoff for review and approval process right.

00:37:03:51 - 00:37:36:34
不明
Makes sense right. From insights. View comments and feedback and respond and don't have to context switch right. It's exciting. Yeah. So think about this. Stitch us on a pillow. I don't want you to work front. I want you to work. Okay. Why? Because that's what we're talking about when we talk about work smarter and play harder. Okay. All right.

00:37:36:38 - 00:38:03:40
不明
What about frame.io? And so he's like, yeah, yeah, the product manager for a frame is in the room. So no, it's frame is an amazing application. And frame does a great job, especially with things like video, but it's enhanced even further to be able to take on additional file types. Frame.io v4 is a market leader and we need to be able to integrate with that.

00:38:03:40 - 00:38:26:19
不明
So we have Frame.io v4 integration via fusion. In future iterations. We're going to integrate that into the applications. So that frame viewer will show up in work front. And that approval part will still be in work front, but the viewer will be consistent across all these different services. So later this year and early next year you're going to see that coming out.

00:38:26:21 - 00:38:38:11
不明
But you can sync comments, you can sync the projects. The status of things can be done right here within frame and back and forth between work front and frame.

00:38:38:15 - 00:39:06:33
不明
What else is coming? There's a lot more coming out. Go to the booth and there's some great experts if you want to know more about some of these integrations, creating workflows that allow you, as campaign managers to generate those projects directly from a campaign or initiating with triggers. Fusion is also bringing in some AI capabilities so that you can use those prompts to even generate flows in different scenarios.

00:39:06:38 - 00:39:32:30
不明
Streamlining timesheet management. Nobody likes timesheets, right? I hate them like nobody wants to do a timesheet. But can we automate that process so that it's not as arduous and also not feeling like your big brother? And so that'll that'll be coming soon. And then that last part, like I said, is that AI assistant will show up in fusion so that you can have that full context between the different surfaces.

00:39:32:35 - 00:40:00:31
不明
You're taking a picture. So I didn't want to move my slide. All right. It wouldn't be a great presentation unless I talked about AI when I was putting this together. My wife's like, why are you talking about al? It's like she didn't actually say that. I just thought it was funny. So AI is important, isn't it? It's critical.

00:40:00:36 - 00:40:31:56
不明
When I talk to people about AI, sometimes people get a little nervous. We've all been part of the technology changes throughout the years. One of the first technologies I worked on was WordPerfect. So yeah. So just like, oh my gosh. I remember word perfect. Everyone kind of tears in there. I and guess what happened when we came out with word processors, I would go into offices that literally had tons of typewriters and they would say, you're taking my job away.

00:40:32:01 - 00:40:51:40
不明
And I'm like, yes, I am, but I'm not taking your skills, so take your skills and apply them to new technology. Those same people went on to say, oh my gosh, I can do bolding, I can do margins, I can do all these things. I don't have to use wite-out right. Yeah. You're really dating? I'm really old.

00:40:51:54 - 00:41:14:39
不明
Yeah, but you don't. You can you can get all that in the same context with I. And so the things that we're coming out with, I think are pretty amazing. The things that you don't want to do every single day, or the things that you wish I would do for you to help you understand what's happening in the system.

00:41:14:44 - 00:41:37:43
不明
We know that putting stuff into work front is critical, important, but sometimes getting it out is hard. Right? I can help you get it out of the system. So starting up there on the left hand side, I'm going to go into these a little more detail. But Project Health right. How do I understand really what is the health of this project.

00:41:37:48 - 00:42:01:26
不明
Somebody might be going in and saying, you know, the condition looks right, looks good, but the actual score of the project is is not good. A reviewer talked about that review process. So now you can have like a mini, you that's going around and saying, I'm going to do a brand check and you can have multiple brand checks with a reviewer.

00:42:01:31 - 00:42:26:19
不明
Hey, I powered requests. I'm going to go into this one a little bit more detail, experience platform assistant for it's a proof of concept that we're coming out with for integrating with AP and other work front assistance, marketing Copilot. So think about this. If you're using M365, what typically happens is you create all your documents and m365 and you save it.

00:42:26:24 - 00:42:45:58
不明
And even if you put it in SharePoint, somebody calls me up or text me, and I'm guilty of this with my own team. Can you send me the link for that again? Right. Send me the link. Which, is the information accurate? No it's not. What version are you on? Oh, it's this different one with the M365 copilot.

00:42:46:03 - 00:43:07:04
不明
All of the work front information through the Adobe marketing agent will be surfaced in context. That's worth it. That's worth a lion right there. Well, what? Let me get one. Get one of those. We're almost out. Our pride is dwindling. How cool is that?

00:43:07:08 - 00:43:30:27
不明
All right, we keep on this screen. This is the right. All right. And then custom agents. So being able to build your own agents and learn from you and the things that you're doing. But let's start out and talk about Project Health. If you're a project manager, which many of you are, it's it's like, hey guys, it's Friday.

00:43:30:32 - 00:43:53:46
不明
We just put your updates in the project. Right? Nathan, do you ever done that? Nathan's done that a ton. And what happens nobody does or they put in there. It's like, Richard will you update the project I'm like fine good to go. Green light right. That means nothing. But most of the updates that people put in there, they change the date or they do things like that.

00:43:53:51 - 00:44:13:56
不明
That means nothing. In fact, it means it's actually not on track. And so with the project Health Advisor, what we're able to do is look at different score, different things that score. I'm just going to let this video play so you can kind of see what's happening here. But I put on a prompt and I say, what's happening with this project.

00:44:14:00 - 00:44:32:46
不明
And there's what's running late. What's the score? It's 65. How do I make that better. And so the AI assistant comes in and says, hey, you know what? If you reassign all this work that Richard does because he never finishes, then it would get higher and I can immediately go from a score of 65 to a score of 86.

00:44:32:51 - 00:44:54:13
不明
Now, initially these things, were controlling that score. So some of those things, one of the first questions I get is can I change some of those, those scoring you will be able to in the future. But initially it's going to look at resources, scope, schedule. Somebody goes into the project and they had 20 more tasks on a Friday.

00:44:54:18 - 00:45:16:35
不明
But the condition still looks right because of the dates line up. That's not a healthy project. And so all of that can be done through the AI assistant. The reviewer. This is going to blow your socks off if you haven't seen it. So again, I don't want to review things over and over and over again. So the AI reviewer streamlines that.

00:45:16:35 - 00:45:54:15
不明
Check that pre-check if you will, to be able to see if the assets associated with my project are actually looking good. So if I if I play this, I drag and drop my brand guidelines in, it creates a specific persona, and then I assign that AI reviewer to look at these different assets they're assigned to this project. So once I've requested that approval and chosen the AI reviewer instead of a person, it does that check and it comes up with a score and it and I know this is moving really quickly, but it comes up with a score and I can quickly see what I may need to fix.

00:45:54:19 - 00:46:16:28
不明
Now, some of those things I can fix myself other things, not fix myself. And I have to send it back to creative and that's okay. But think about from a global brand perspective, many of the global brands, they have a, an overarching brand, they have, country, they have a region, and then they have a specific target audience.

00:46:16:28 - 00:46:43:26
不明
All of those could be different reviewers, and you could automatically review the asset to see if it's on brand. Who likes finding requests? Cuz I hate it. Right? Think about AI with natural prompt. I can come in here and I can describe what I want and then when it describes it, it's going to pull in exactly the type of requests.

00:46:43:26 - 00:47:05:04
不明
I'm like, yep, that's the one. I want the quarterly marketing campaign. And then I can actually take a document that I may have written that is the whole brief. And I can either drag and drop it in here or I can upload it and it scrapes that document. And guess what it's going to do at the end. It's going to fill it out.

00:47:05:09 - 00:47:29:59
不明
So now all of that gets pulled in, and this form will automatically be filled out with all the information from that document. Because there's two things that happen with briefs. Number one, they're not brief. Number two, they're static. And so getting them into the system and making them dynamic. Now all of that can be brought in and those records created.

00:47:29:59 - 00:47:47:55
不明
So I'm starting to build a marketing system of record. Guess what. And Lawrence says this over and over and she's really good at this. You don't get a system of record without records. Okay.

00:47:47:59 - 00:48:12:14
不明
Now there's a lot more that's coming with AI. So I encourage you to go down to the booth. We're also in the agent zone. You'll see workflow optimization. That's the work, friends agent. And so go take a look at that. We're also going to be showing up in other parts of agents as skills. But I want to talk a little bit about how do you work with agencies and how do you work with if you're providing client services?

00:48:12:14 - 00:48:41:53
不明
There's a lot of things that we're doing in this area as well. So and these apply not just to agencies and those service organizations, but even generally financial management. Do you think granular billing rates, multiple exchange rates if you're a global organization, detailed permissions. Right. And so being able to have that flexibility again from a global perspective and keeping things confidential, those resource management and those staffing plans, we've enhanced that quite a bit.

00:48:41:57 - 00:49:08:33
不明
And you'll see that coming out reporting right. We need reports. We need to be able to get that information out. And then non labor resources at one point we call this non human resources. Nobody like that. So but these are things that you know cameras and conference rooms and studios and things like that. So if we talk about a couple of these for example top down staffing.

00:49:08:38 - 00:49:39:25
不明
So this new capability that you kind of see the screenshot here is being able to create those planning of the resources needed from a macro view. Okay. And the benefits of this, of course, is that you can ensure all your resources are utilized and identified. And maybe not even think about needing to hire somebody. And what I mean by that is all of us in this room have more skills than we're actually in the job of right?

00:49:39:30 - 00:49:57:29
不明
You hired me because I had all these skills, right? We hired Paul because he had a ton of skills. And then now he's the product management head for work front. Everybody thinks of him as a product management head for work front. And if you put him in a box, you don't get the value of the rest of the skills that he has.

00:49:57:33 - 00:50:19:13
不明
And so as we start to unlock these capabilities, imagine a world where you could go in there and say, I need somebody that is an animator. I bet you somebody in your organization is an animator. Why can't I find that you should be able to find that, and then that makes people feel more valued. You do your best work.

00:50:19:13 - 00:50:44:34
不明
When you know your role, you know it matters and you're proud of your work. And this helps unlock that those non laborer or non-human resources. Right. Maybe you have cameras. Maybe you have other studios that you need to schedule. There's a cost potentially associated with it. Maybe you even have something like a factory that you send things to print to or to produce.

00:50:44:34 - 00:51:10:38
不明
All of those can be loaded into work front as part of that project. So the future is bright. I'm going to let Paul kind of finish up here. He stole my line. I didn't I didn't say you got to wear shades though. Okay. No, no, I really did it now. I said it now. Okay. Well, we are very excited about the future of work front.

00:51:10:45 - 00:51:31:08
不明
Are you excited? You see what you're seeing? Yeah, it's very exciting. The team the team is working very hard. We're listening a lot to you. We're listening a lot to the feedback. What you need, what needs to happen? We've talked about the booth already. But I also want to just invite you to, to, attend our frequent roadmap updates.

00:51:31:13 - 00:51:49:34
