Well, thank you for coming to the session today. It's a it's a full crowd, which we're very excited about. I think there's a waitlist to get in. So you are the lucky 350 people. All right. So, you all signed up for the session, so you know what it's about, but this is, about T-Mobile and how they have, harness the power of Adobe to revolutionize.

00:00:20:13 - 00:00:46:21
不明
Revolutionize? Excuse me? Customer engagement. So we're just going to do a quick round of introductions today. I'm your moderator. My name is Stephanie Antonelli. I lead our enterprise solutions group at, VML, and I'm Whitney Hutchinson. I run CRM ops at T-Mobile. Hello. I'm Graham sensing. I'm the lead program manager for the app delivery team, actually, with Adobe Professional Services partnering with, with, T-Mobile here.

00:00:46:26 - 00:01:06:45
不明
Hi, Amber. Nova, side head of production, leading the CRM operations and deployment with Whitney for VML for VML. Sorry, sorry HTML. Excellent. All right. So a quick just level setting for the day. Setting the stage. We're going to go through a bit of history and background and a couple of the notions that make this, this program successful.

00:01:06:50 - 00:01:22:04
不明
Talk about the journey to today, how we got here, some of the wins along the way. We're going to have a bit of a panel discussion at the end before we get into Q&A. We will leave time for that. So please don't be shy. Ask questions. Everybody here is is very prepared to answer anything you can throw our way.

00:01:22:04 - 00:01:41:53
不明
So with that let's go ahead and jump in. There are plenty of seats to if anybody wants to come on up, don't be shy. Okay. So I think that this, this quote from Mike Sievert, who the CEO of T-Mobile kind of sets the stage for where we're going today, which is that pro customer change is inevitable for all industries.

00:01:41:58 - 00:02:01:07
不明
Many companies fight and delay it, but if you embrace and lead it, T-Mobile will always be one of the few. And I think that's a very proud statement from him and something that is reflected in the work that you'll see today. So just a little bit of setting the stage and background information. This has been a very long standing partnership, and all of us on this stage are very proud of that.

00:02:01:12 - 00:02:22:23
不明
We've worked with T-Mobile for over 15 years, across a multitude of different programs, with wonderful clients along the way across marketing. And it it's been excellent, 15 plus years for Adobe and T-Mobile as well. And then over 20 years of partnership for VML and Adobe. So if you kind of look around the room, probably see a lot of people, you know, same can go for the people on the stage.

00:02:22:34 - 00:02:40:34
不明
It's been wonderful to work with everybody, across the years and kind of see how the business has transformed as we've, as we've gotten tighter. So overall, this is a little bit of the background just kind of scratching the surface at the types of work that we do with T-Mobile. We've been partnering with T-Mobile since 2009.

00:02:40:39 - 00:03:11:43
不明
We provide end to end support across creative development, CRM, operations, tech, campaign work, deployment all the way through reporting and analysis. We also support brand marketing service teams, for postpaid and prepaid work. Business division Metro home internet, anything you can really think of. We have a very deep understanding and intimate knowledge of the T-Mobile brand, the business, the culture in which T-Mobile puts forth products and so on.

00:03:11:58 - 00:03:35:12
不明
Technology infrastructure as well. It's been a very vast relationship. It's been nice to be able to touch all parts of the business and really round out what is, I think, a very sound strategy when it comes to marrying up technology, CRM, data and customer experiences. Here are just a few examples of some of the email creative work that VML produces for T-Mobile and deploys to customers.

00:03:35:16 - 00:03:56:47
不明
These include phone and device offers, for postpaid, customer benefits, highlighting and introducing some of the new plans for Metro and the for the prepaid offering and then any service, pricing that comes with, with home internet, which is something that we've been doing recently, along the way and, very vast and, and deep work.

00:03:56:47 - 00:04:22:39
不明
So I think Graham's going to talk to us a little bit more about the Adobe services that match up with that. Yeah. So again, I'm with the Adobe Professional Services team, and I had the honor being the delivery leader, with the tenable I.T group that was kind of responsible for building the ground zero capabilities and features and products, set up to be able to allow for for Whitney and for VML here to, start their their digital transformation in the messaging space.

00:04:22:44 - 00:04:49:48
不明
And so and they'll said this yesterday or this morning. Excuse me. Already been a long day. And also this morning. But Adobe really focuses on on building products that help people. And that's been core to our partnership. In fact, something that, that we really have. Well, between Adobe, T-Mobile is the bi directional feedback. We're helping them in fronting strategy from professional services and ultimate support team to help them structure processes and people that partner well with the IT capabilities themselves.

00:04:49:53 - 00:05:15:59
不明
But we're also getting that bidirectional feedback from T-Mobile, helping us improve as organization and also influencing our roadmap along the way. And so it's been a very, very, healthy, constructive relationship between us and T-Mobile. And so from a partnership perspective, the capabilities and products that we have built out, we do have things from ATM app, lot around V8 and campaign agile, target analytics.

00:05:15:59 - 00:05:28:48
不明
It's kind of the whole experience cloud suite, if you will. So the vision, that you kind of see of putting the whole cloud together, really has been implemented and activated here with T-Mobile.

00:05:28:53 - 00:05:45:40
不明
And so I think you can see this theme, I, I think VML got me this spot and I said, okay, I don't want to do it by myself. So all partners come with me. Because it's really been key to our success. So the, I see the VML team as an extension of my operations team.

00:05:45:45 - 00:06:08:52
不明
And Adobe is our partner day in, day out at the table, helping us figure out how to do all of this. And the other really key parts to our relationships are those that I have internally with our tech partners who really are responsible for the platform, our data partners who enable the operations and, the marketing experiences and service, experiences that my team, deploys.

00:06:09:05 - 00:06:33:36
不明
And those relationships, both internally and externally, have been absolutely, pivotal to the success that we've had so far. And what I think will be, much success moving forward. And, you know, relationships are really pivotal how we're going to, get, success in our current reality. So T-Mobile has been the challenger brand for a very long time in this space.

00:06:33:41 - 00:07:00:51
不明
But not anymore. We're the champion now, and we have to operate a little bit differently. Right? We have we are 1,000% customer obsessed. We are really focused on becoming a data informed, AI enabled, digital first company. These are words that come straight from our CEO to our ears every single day. And, this sort of, again, this partnership that we have, to get us to these aspirations, are, is is super important.

00:07:00:55 - 00:07:21:28
不明
So how do I personally play into that vision? I run our CRM operations team. We, we service all of the communications that go out across, out to customers, be it marketing, service, some in the middle we support, we're a shared service, so we support all of the lobbies, the lines of business within T-Mobile.

00:07:21:28 - 00:07:46:55
不明
So Stephanie sort of mentioned we have postpaid services. We have prepaid with a few different brands, Metro and Magenta, prepaid. We have Assurance Wireless. We have different brands within our home internet and broadband, line of business. And my team supports all of those communications, across multiple channels. So just some stats here.

00:07:46:55 - 00:08:15:36
不明
You can see in 2024 we did over 1000 campaigns, hundreds and hundreds by channel, and many, many, many, many iterations, segments, treatments, whatever, whatever cut you want to take. So we do a lot, a lot of marketing and a lot of service messaging. And so I started with T-Mobile a couple of years ago, and when I started, there was my operation was really disparate.

00:08:15:36 - 00:08:43:39
不明
So every one of those lines of business had its own martech, had its own data ecosystem, had its own process. And I needed to sort of bring all of this together to, to really, transform how we were going to get to, sort of the next phase in our journey. That cohesive ecosystem was really going to help us drive operational efficiency, marketing effectiveness, and then enable more advanced customer experiences.

00:08:43:39 - 00:09:03:14
不明
Right? So we couldn't do that when all of our customer data was siloed, all of our operations were siloed. And, just simply from the number of systems we had to operate into, I think we worked in at least ten down to now, we're, we're we're almost done with this full transformation. And we'll be working within two.

00:09:03:23 - 00:09:27:51
不明
So that's drastically changed the way that my team operates, how efficient we can be and how effective we can be. And I'm looking at the screen and I'm passing it to Amber. Yeah. So just to talk a little bit about our journey and how we've been partnering with T-Mobile over the past 15 years and working through this transition over to Adobe.

00:09:27:55 - 00:09:56:33
不明
So we had T-Mobile approach us and say that they wanted to create a modern CRM capability. And then from what we did is our VML partnership with T-Mobile. We collaborated with them for a ten week engagement, and we looked at an operating model and created a strategic engagement for us to be able to create an actionable program and build of what the team would look like across people, processes, technology and the tools.

00:09:56:38 - 00:10:17:06
不明
We made sure that we were able to be flexible, scalable, and what we did in the next few slides that we'll talk through is just how we set up the program. So we did an assessment to look at the transformation over the course of time. So we looked at first four different key areas operating model, government governance, marketing, CRM.

00:10:17:06 - 00:10:36:42
不明
And then we looked at analytics. The first piece looking at the operating model, we evaluated the existing processes and looked at ways to optimize the existing processes and then also create new ways of working. We knew that the ways of working in which we were working in with the current tools would not transition to the ways of working in Adobe.

00:10:36:46 - 00:11:04:39
不明
Secondly, we looked at governance. We reviewed the existing team structure across VML and T-Mobile, and we looked at a new org design which created a federated model which was more or less what Whitney was alluding to earlier is the one team and acting as one team, leaning in to make sure that we were collaborating at every given moment in time, as well as Adobe, to make sure that we were cohesive and working extremely well together.

00:11:04:44 - 00:11:32:40
不明
We then looked at the transition of the current campaigns and view business as usual and the current tools, and then looked at how we would transition and to Adobe and making sure that, you know, at any given point in time, knowing that it's not a super easy transition to do it all. At one time, we did a phased transition, so we worked on a roadmap with T-Mobile and Adobe to make sure that we were transitioning the right amount of campaigns at the right time to not do it all at once.

00:11:32:45 - 00:11:47:30
不明
We then looked at operational efficiency metrics and also ROI to make sure that we were continuously looking at those metrics and hitting upon those operational efficiencies as we transitioned.

00:11:47:34 - 00:12:11:04
不明
We looked at this over a phased transition. So three different stages. We did the platform transition, then a transition to transformation and then scaling transformation. And we did it in this way again to ensure that we had the business continuity and making sure that we were able to maintain the business and the success that we had with the current tools while slowly transitioning over into Adobe.

00:12:11:09 - 00:12:36:03
不明
So we looked at this in platform transition. There was very little usable content and assets that we could pull and lift and shift over. So we had to rebuild audiences with T-Mobile. We had to rebuilt, rebuild the HTML, so we made sure that we had a six month time frame to look at that transition. We then looked at the transformation, the transition, excuse me to transformation.

00:12:36:03 - 00:13:08:10
不明
And that was when we were making sure that our teams were upskilling, up leveling and making sure that they were getting the knowledge that they needed to in order to transition over successfully. So we had teams focusing on current tools and view business as usual. And then we had some teams focusing on the exact Adobe transition itself. And so going side by side and then eventually transitioning the entire team over into using Adobe and last but not least, we looked at what do you do in the long term after you get the team set up for success, start doing those pilots and the programs.

00:13:08:15 - 00:13:35:57
不明
Then you start to be able to operationalize and use those efficiency efficiencies to maintain and grow. The campaign work in Adobe also. Hey, back to Whitney. And so the foundational work for all of this started in 2022. And it again, talk a lot about partnerships in this, presentation. It started with CRM ops, our data partners and our tech partners internally.

00:13:36:01 - 00:13:58:35
不明
And really had to build that foundation working with DML on how we were going to actually do that. So we had to create a process where and a program where we kept value and all of those legacy systems and we enabled new experiences in Adobe, without spending an extra dollar and without breaking anything. Not sure.

00:13:58:35 - 00:14:17:15
不明
We we didn't spend an extra dollars, might have broken a few things, but we didn't spend any more money, so we thought that was a huge success. What we did was we built we were very, very structured, very disciplined in how we would do this. We built sort of standard, phases for this migration, across, plan.

00:14:17:15 - 00:14:35:33
不明
So this is where we were building our business requirements, really understanding across all of the lines of business, what would they need to, what would we need to do to enable what they needed to do for their business? What was their data? Their data, ecosystem? What was the infrastructure? What did we need to do to pull that into a more cohesive, plan?

00:14:35:38 - 00:14:57:39
不明
We went through build, we did, sort of really interesting work with Adobe, where they taught us basically how to fish. Right? So we said, don't give us out of the box training, please sit with us and so Adobe would build our campaigns and we would watch and VML would watch, and then VML and my team would build and Adobe would watch and make sure we were okay.

00:14:57:39 - 00:15:17:29
不明
And, it was highly successful to do it that way. So we're, we're building on actual campaigns and sort of, starting that migration on the backs of Adobe Professional Services, which was great, testing, hugely important, to get through to make sure that data was flowing correctly. That data was validated that everything was ready to go.

00:15:17:29 - 00:15:36:19
不明
So that QA testing phase was really, really important. Then we went through go live, and now in some of the labs were really into optimizing those experiences and sort of the workflow and the things that we're doing. We then took those phases and we waterfall them by line of business. So we had a very actionable migration roadmap.

00:15:36:19 - 00:16:03:24
不明
I mean, we lived against this schedule for two years. And what we were trying to do again was move, move lines of business over, automate as much as we could, save money, turn off, old tackle. I'll go through that in a second. Start with the next line of business. And as we were learning, we would document what we were learning so that the next line of business we made maybe less mistakes or found out, fewer things that we didn't know.

00:16:03:28 - 00:16:29:54
不明
And we were very, very disciplined in, how we, managed this migration roadmap and all of this, really has led us to some pretty big wins. And so we're excited to walk you through some of those, in the past two years, this transformation has really netted us quite a lot. We've integrated 21 different data sources to build a cohesive customer profile.

00:16:30:05 - 00:16:52:01
不明
So we're not we don't have a siloed profile. It's now specific to T-Mobile. You're a T-Mobile customer. It doesn't matter if you're prepaid postpaid or ACW. Hint it's all one profile. We, consolidated a bunch of messaging platforms down to just campaign and agile. So we had a lot of email service providers. We had different messaging systems.

00:16:52:01 - 00:17:20:25
不明
It's now just within those two, we reduced our effort to build on launch campaigns by 40%. Part of that was, you know, adjusting how my team operates. Part of that was adjusting my VML contract down a little bit. So lots of, optimization in terms of operation. And most importantly, we decrease a lot of tech that so it was not only tech that in terms of licensing fees, it was maintenance.

00:17:20:25 - 00:17:45:24
不明
It was, you know, the management of all these different ecosystems, which netted T-Mobile, significant savings. Each year. And we're going to I'll talk through some of those enterprise realizations and how we, how we measured those ongoing, it was also really important, as we were going through this migration, to highlight our quick wins and our wins along the way.

00:17:45:28 - 00:18:11:02
不明
We'll we'll highlight one, key cross-channel journey that we've been able to enable via this ecosystem where we couldn't before. And then, I'm teeing up for my colleague tomorrow on Ed Strom, who's in the. She's right over here in the audience. There's other, other things outside of my team that this ecosystem is allowing. And so I'm just going to talk tomorrow about how AI decisioning is, really evolving based on this ecosystem.

00:18:11:02 - 00:18:34:09
不明
And I highly encourage you to go listen to her tomorrow for. Cool. So as I mentioned earlier, Adobe really came in as part of Ground Zero, partnered with the T-Mobile I.T organization to make sure that we had the platform built out. I think the metaphor when I joked about earlier was, you know, building the kitchen or building the house before her team and CMO marketing can move in and start to utilize all those tools.

00:18:34:13 - 00:18:59:42
不明
And so we we really started, with going in and we did have AEP and a unified customer profile. That's a buzzword I get paid by the hour to say every few minutes. But we did really have that unified customer profile, in our line of sight. And we also are aligned from the top down on both organizations, of the goal, and the value of what this messaging migration could bring to T-Mobile and its operations.

00:18:59:47 - 00:19:28:52
不明
And so with those things in focus and insight, a lot of our technical, messaging and data and architectural leads from a professional services, we got to go in and we got to work alongside with T-Mobile, to kind of review and catalog all the existing systems messages, and capabilities that were required to be able to move from Blue Legacy to, to now blue was going to run and operate inside the Adobe stack.

00:19:28:57 - 00:19:55:48
不明
And so what's really powerful there again, is that partnership is, T-Mobile. And we've not really dug in. And they helped us with the catalog of documentation of what was blue. And I know that was not, it's a huge ecosystem with lots of acquisitions over time. So that's not an easy undertaking. And so I commend T-Mobile for, for in the VML for bringing that to the table, because what it allowed us to do really quickly was look at all the different messaging systems, look at the capabilities, the business requirements.

00:19:55:53 - 00:20:24:34
不明
The velocity of the data is being sent and really getting real, real nerdy. And that unified customer profile, by going really nerdy to look at what data is available in AEP today from the initial MVP use cases that we had mainly utilized for, for front end at the time, for things on the screen, what what data was missing that needed to be brought in, for the messaging migration to actually begin and the markers to get hands on keyboard.

00:20:24:39 - 00:20:48:07
不明
And so, after that analysis and breaking that down, and we did break that in different phases, as is when you mentioned. So phase one was we started with, launching in 23 to V8. So we had batch campaigns, that actually had an integration into AP. So V8 shared, that profile with AP, so that where there there's always a centralized view of the customer.

00:20:48:12 - 00:21:05:38
不明
We know we were not trying to repeat sins of the past and had broken views of the customer. Right. So we really focused on AP being the core of that of the profile, and what the customer was being communicated to. And we built on an added V8 onto that. So outbound messaging could go traditionally in a batch style.

00:21:05:42 - 00:21:27:21
不明
Correct. And so from there we looked at the campaigns that wanted to be migrated and we said, okay, we have the data ready and we have the capabilities ready. So t mobile marketing, VML, your team is ready to able to start to operate and move campaigns in this phase one bucket. From there, we started to implement and integrate, agile capabilities.

00:21:27:21 - 00:21:55:34
不明
So that's more of your real time, 1 to 1 personalized messaging that included push, integrating with, the TI life app. So push was available there. SMS obviously had to be activated. And so we had our real time messaging capabilities then set up and ready to go. And at that point, we moved on to phase two, which allowed the marketing team to say, okay, great, we can start moving these types of campaigns from these systems over to Adobe.

00:21:55:39 - 00:22:14:09
不明
And then lastly was obviously the data. The long tail in this project is the data migration. And that's just because with, how important governance and security, and getting the right data into AP to make sure you're marketing the right customer at the right time, that's just it's it's an important subject that you don't want to rush into.

00:22:14:09 - 00:22:31:15
不明
And so we did do that very thoughtfully, and we partnered with T-Mobile security team to how we were getting that data. And we made sure privacy was central to the theme of what we were doing, and also to make sure the right customer at the right time, at the right pace. And so, we partnered with the IT data.

00:22:31:15 - 00:22:51:25
不明
IT partners at T-Mobile to prioritize a backlog based off the existing data that we wanted to bring into the campaign to make that unified customer profile more holistic, and better to achieve the end to end goals for the entire marketing ecosystem. Along the way and what you mentioned this as well, but we did do that hands on training, which we called Hand over.

00:22:51:25 - 00:23:21:39
不明
And it was it started with every time we had a capability built. So let's use agile for example. And we had agile. Push was now an activated capability. We did a lot of document training, documentation and training that was personalized. The T-Mobile. This is how it's specific to your integration, taking in your privacy policy it's a consideration etc., etc. and walk through not only T-Mobile IT, which is the team that I work with day in, day out and getting those built, but enabling the marketing marketing team to understand that and be able to use those tools.

00:23:21:39 - 00:23:42:42
不明
So we did personalized Hanover training. They watched our team build the first few campaigns, and then we moved to where they were building, and we were sitting side coaching to watch them build those campaigns. And I didn't go out the door. And I do think that was a big metric for success. That gained velocity for the for the marketing team as needed to start building these messages inside, inside the ecosystem.

00:23:42:46 - 00:24:00:36
不明
And so lastly, also, you know, we had the same project that was not just messaging that we focused on, but that same type of training and enablement had to happen for data architects to bring that into the system. It had to happen for how we are plugging mobile and web SDK. It had to happen for, into the to the screens for app and web.

00:24:00:41 - 00:24:18:21
不明
And it had to happen for how we were building segments and audiences and in fact, building a taxonomy, of audience management was inside our CDP. So that way it could also scale for not only the business today, but how, when you could take her team forward to expand those audiences to future campaigns in the future. So future campaigns in the future?

00:24:18:23 - 00:24:39:02
不明
Yep. Double future. And so that's really kind of the partnership that we had. And so now, you know, we are moving on to doing more capabilities and some of the things that we teased with audience session tomorrow. But about real time decisioning on, on, on the web and, and app. But, yeah, that's really the how Adobe partnered to hand it over to the marketing team.

00:24:39:07 - 00:24:55:52
不明
And so all of that led to these wins that we're going to talk about. So again, you're going to see the here's the same roadmap. What we did within this roadmap was highlight our wins as we were going. We didn't wait till the end. We're actually still not done. We have one more line of business that we're finishing up.

00:24:55:57 - 00:25:14:22
不明
Like in the next two weeks we're going to have a huge celebration. But we wanted to highlight these quick wins as we went. We wanted to share with leadership and with our partners where we were making progress. So we broke it down into three categories. We had, platform decommission and we had operational efficiencies. And then we had modern marketing enablement.

00:25:14:33 - 00:25:31:54

And as we were migrating each line of business into this new ecosystem and cleaning up our operation, we were turning off different tech. Right? So all of these little black boxes on the bottom are all the platforms. So we had to work in all the platforms. We had to pay licensing fees to all the platforms. We had to manage from a maintenance perspective.

00:25:31:58 - 00:25:49:49
不明
And as we were going, we were highlighting as we were turning those off and mapping that, savings to the company. Then we added in when we would, what operational efficiencies, where are we getting where were we reducing our time to market? Where were we, saving on our agency fees? Where were we saving on our contractor fees?

00:25:49:49 - 00:26:15:45
不明
And we mapped those in, and then what was most exciting to some of our leadership on the marketing side was more, when are those advanced capability is going to be available for us to do all this cool stuff that we bought, right? Advanced audience creation, automation, cross-channel journeys. And so as we went and as we continue to go, we highlight these every time, we we stop, we celebrate, we have a little bit of champagne when we turn another platform off.

00:26:15:50 - 00:26:39:48
不明
Because it's a long journey and we want to, we want to have celebration along the way. And it's been really, really helpful. So huge savings from a dollar amount from an efficiency perspective. And we really are able to create, significantly better experiences for our customers. So I'm going to highlight one really quick, network pass is a program we have for, prospective customers to come in and try our network.

00:26:39:48 - 00:27:02:45
不明
So if anybody is not a T-Mobile customer, shame on you. But please go sign up for Network Pass. You can try the you can try our network out for, 90 to 30 days, 90 days. Thank you. 90 days. We're looking at optimizing the journey because we're we're getting so sophisticated, we're going to adjust it. So this program, used to be very manual.

00:27:02:54 - 00:27:23:43
不明
It was not all channels. It was a lot of batch campaigns. We did it, like, in batches, like, oh, let's do everybody on day one and then day ten and then, in just a few channels. It was one of the first journeys we migrated over. It's now a multi-channel journey. It's fully automated. It's based on advanced if then logic.

00:27:23:43 - 00:27:47:08
不明
Right. As customers engage, they get a different experiences. They convert, they get a different experience. Might I keep looking over here at my great team over here? Who are the ones that, built it and manage it all, day in, day out? And it's been really successful, so not only is it driving Lyft and bands, which is our accounts, it's also driving, Lyft in our lines for our account.

00:27:47:13 - 00:28:10:15
不明
It's also driving Lyft an interesting segments. So, people in rural areas, which is one of our key areas we're trying to, share with everybody that our network is actually really strong there. It's working well there. And people convert more in digital, which is also a strategy, as I mentioned. In terms of being a data informed company, we want people to be able to self-serve and to, activate and engage in digital.

00:28:10:15 - 00:28:37:55
不明
So it's been a super, successful, program. We're optimizing it now. You can see on that bottom graphs around the 30 day mark, we're seeing most of the activation there. So we're going to start to optimize that journey specific to that. But this is something we couldn't have done. I don't think we could have done this outside of the Adobe ecosystem in our previous ecosystem, and we certainly couldn't have done it in the efficient way we are, nor could we have seen these insights, at the level we needed to, to optimize.

00:28:37:55 - 00:28:59:36
不明
So it's been a huge success. This is one of very, a lot of journeys that we're enabling. So just one success story. Amazing. Okay. So with that, we're going to enter into a panel discussion and then we're going to go into Q&A. So, I think obviously the major theme of today is it was massively successful and we're still on that journey.

00:28:59:36 - 00:29:34:22
不明
But with any program of the size and any transformation of this size, can you just speak? I think maybe give everybody a chance to to kind of answer this question independently. But what unexpected challenges did emerge as you were consolidating platforms, migrating, looking at creating this unified customer profile? No one wants to go. Although, I think that the biggest challenge for us was, sort of right sizing and validating the data from all of these, you know, the platform was ready, the capability was there, and what held us up was our data.

00:29:34:22 - 00:29:53:54
不明
Right. How could we get our data in a format that would allow us to use it? How could we make sure that we sort of right sized from postpaid to prepaid, so that we could build that unified profile? That was and I think every single line of business that we brought over, we think we know and that we really don't know.

00:29:53:54 - 00:30:18:39
不明
And so we spend a lot of time really making sure that that, which is really the lifeblood. Right? It's our, it's how our, it's what we know about our customers. It's how they speak to us. It's all of the things we know. It's the most important part. We were highly protective of it. And so how we get it in a way that we can really use it to drive those experiences, was definitely a challenge for us.

00:30:18:39 - 00:30:46:30
不明
And I think we've made huge progress. So that was unexpected to me that that part of it would be quite so hard. Yeah, I think I think the technology is ahead of how we work as people. Sometimes we're very much into our silos or into our organizations. And the technology is now able to bring us together. And so, that's a challenge that enterprises across every organization ecosystem face.

00:30:46:35 - 00:31:13:01
不明
What I really appreciate it with, T-Mobile is the leadership from Whitney and her partners in it and the data teams to really say, in fact, I'll quote when you heard this earlier today, they had a goal to finish each other's sentences. If they could be unified, our teams could be unified. And that really helped us, have the goal of that cross communication of the one vision like this is the focus, and it allowed us to really remove barriers of, competing priorities because we knew, no, no, no, this is the priority.

00:31:13:10 - 00:31:36:04
不明
We can't we have to re prioritize data ingestion for a different campaign because the cost savings, operational efficiencies or whatever, what have you, whatever that priority was. Whitney and the leadership team at T-Mobile were aligned on, doing it in a unified way. And so that was very helpful. But it is a challenge that, is often, often hard to overcome.

00:31:36:09 - 00:31:55:24
不明
So I'm sorry. Amber. Oh. You're good. Okay. I was going to ask the next question. Here. Just. I think, Whitney, part of your success is that you've built this program in such a collaborative way, and you've celebrated the moments, as you said, along the way, so that it doesn't feel like one big celebration, that you're waiting such a long time for.

00:31:55:24 - 00:32:22:58
不明
But you get to have those moments with your leadership, with the teams on the ground. Was there any internal resistance along the way to this? How did you deal with that? How did you kind of lift lift everybody up along the way? Yeah, there certainly was. I think everybody saw the vision and wanted it to be better, but when it comes down to your day to day, people liked the way they worked and they liked the systems they worked in, and they liked the way that system did what it needed for them.

00:32:23:09 - 00:32:45:54
不明
And so, and I'm in my team is laughing down there. We did a lot of, you know, a lot of coaching and cheerleading, and it's okay to make mistakes and, and if you know, anything hits the fan, I'll take I'll take responsibility. And what's really funny now is that, And you guys can correct me if if I'm wrong.

00:32:45:59 - 00:33:00:50
不明
Right now, we're really starting to lean into agile and all of the things that agile can do for us. And there's, I mean, there's some complicated stuff we're trying to do, and everybody's like, but we could do it in V8, right? When it took me about a year to get everybody comfortable in V8. So now we're comfortable there.

00:33:00:50 - 00:33:17:08
不明
And so it's just one of those things I think, you know, you know what, you know, when you like what you know, and but what we did was really, again, kind of embrace our partners and embrace our partners internally, and say, we're going to do this together and it's going to be bumpy, and that's okay.

00:33:17:13 - 00:33:36:10
不明
So I mean, with that, what advice would you give other organizations who are going through this? I mean, people process tools, everything across the board. What's your what's your biggest takeaway and piece of advice? I don't, don't downplay the people part. Agree. So thank you everyone. If you have any other questions, feel free to come up.

00:33:36:10 - 00:33:40:28
不明
But we are done. So appreciate the time. Thank you.
