Hi everyone, my name is Ben Chen. I am a product marketer for Adobe Experience Manager assets. Our industry leading, innovative, AI infused digital asset management solution enables organizations to meet the growing content demand and drive business outcomes with high quality content and personalized customer experience. Is. Those who attended my summer session last year may remember that I have presented the same topic about the future of their.

00:00:35:03 - 00:01:08:00
不明
But as you may know, the landscape of content management and them have been evolving at an unprecedented pace, fueled by the rapid development of the AI and change of customer expectations. What you be hearing from me is an evolution of a vision of them, and hopefully you will leave the session feeling inspired and you should start re-imagining. What does a future ready them look like for you and your organization.

00:01:08:02 - 00:01:40:03
不明
Realigning your content and them. Strategy, and evaluating whether your tech stack currently in place can cope with all the content challenges and get you to the desired outcomes. So first of all, I would like to speak to some trends that we have observed in the industry. And from the conversations we had with many of our customers, especially the marketing and creative teams and departments about content management.

00:01:40:05 - 00:02:09:13
不明
It may sound cliche, but the market is really changing so quickly. The complexity of content challenges is stacking up, and the pressure is mounting on all the marketing and creative teams of every organization as they grow. Organizations need to reduce their time to market, meaning that they need to accelerate the content journey to get those content in the channels real fast.

00:02:09:15 - 00:02:59:09
不明
To achieve this, you need a platform that democratizes content accessibility for everyone in the organization so that anyone can discover and reuse content timely to create winning experiences for the customers. Next is Genie is no longer a buzzword, but every organization is exploring or have already started investing into gen AI to help scale content productivity. This exponential growth of spending means a lot more content is going to be created, and the next challenge that comes will be how to maintain governance, how to make sure content is created and used it responsibly and aligned with brand guidelines.

00:02:59:12 - 00:03:42:16
不明
Organization. We need a trusted content lake that can intelligently help users to adapt content with brand guardrails and to maintain compliance. The next trend is hyper personalization. Again, none of us work. This is a key differentiator for organizations to really drive winning customer experiences, purchase intent, and conversion. But as marketing campaigns scale and spend across so many different channels and touchpoints these days, it is really difficult for marketers to keep up with the pace to scale and achieve sustainable results.

00:03:42:18 - 00:04:12:05
不明
So there is a need for a single point to optimize actively and automatically scale to content delivery to downstream channels. And with all this in mind, you will now be looking at a double digit number of growth of content to be created. While it is not uncommon that most organizations marketing and content creation project as they are flat if not reduced.

00:04:12:07 - 00:04:35:19
不明
So you would need to unlock more value from existing tools and tech stacks, including a them, to help streamline the process and resources, and also to provide you insights like how the content is performing so you can adjust your content strategy to get more value out of it.

00:04:35:21 - 00:05:12:18
不明
And more. These are exactly why we have seen an exponential growth of demand of them from enterprises these days. Them are becoming so much more compelling than ever as organizations are seeking for a silver bullet to solve the content, challenges and organizations expectation to them have also evolved. Now is no longer just a repository or library to securely store assets, but also an integral solution to support scaling of content activation.

00:05:12:21 - 00:05:34:14
不明
Forced to collaborate between stakeholders of content. Turbocharge speed of content delivery. Assemble fragmented content into meaningful experiences to drive customer engagement and maintain brand compliance and governance of content at scale.

00:05:34:16 - 00:06:03:22
不明
So they are a lot to ask, and what we have seen a lot in organizations are still struggling with problems of disconnected workflows, technologies and teams that hinder the ability to effectively deliver and scale content like what is being shown here at Adobe. We call it the spaghetti slide, and I personally call it the nightmare of a broken content supply.

00:06:03:22 - 00:06:14:16
不明
Chains, lies that illustrate the chaotic nature of how the content and acid flows within an organization.

00:06:14:18 - 00:06:51:05
不明
The good news is, an enterprise demo should be able to tame the chaos and become the point of orchestration of content workflow of an organization. Starting from consolidating all brand approved the assets sitting in multiple siloed repositories owned and managed by separate teams and departments into one single source of truth for effective management, then applying control and consistency to all the assets, then enriching this valuable brand approved assets by properly applying metadata.

00:06:51:07 - 00:07:21:25
不明
So, to enhance the searchability of them and also helping with compliance and automation workflows by connecting the dev and the content to every single touchpoint internally and externally. If you are a team buyer or owner, or have been involved in evaluating and choosing a dam for your organization, you must have noticed that there are so many solutions now available in the market, especially compared to just five, if not ten years ago.

00:07:21:28 - 00:07:50:05
不明
Again, it just tells you how compelling them is these days. However, not all solutions are created equal. They are solutions that are built for specific tasks or use cases. They may be quick to set up and deployed, and provide simpler connectors for simple integrations, and usually look more affordable. And the price tag? They may look good for a single team or department to use case, or as a starting point to getting a dam.

00:07:50:07 - 00:08:21:11
不明
However, organizations may soon face blockers growing, the adoption of the platform and expanding the use cases and scale due to limitations like lacking advanced workflows, integration points, scalability, and performance to support grow a volume of assets, and additional tools to cover other content management requirements. So when an organization is committed to invest in a Dam, you should not be only looking at what is needed.

00:08:21:11 - 00:08:51:14
不明
For now, but also the next 18 months, three years, five years and beyond. There should not be situation, although we have actually heard and seen a lot of times from our customers before that their content demand at the end has outgrown the solution they chose in the first place. Ideally, an enterprise team solution should be able to offer the flexibility to start small, but also a seamless path to expand and scale the platform.

00:08:51:17 - 00:09:22:08
不明
Instead of ending up with multiple dams or repositories, the dam shall be a unified platform and serves as a centerpiece of the organization's entire content supply chain. It should be capable of supporting integrated content workflows across various platforms and channels, providing advanced and customizable metadata in search capabilities to make sure content discovery is never a problem, no matter how many more users and assets are in the dam.

00:09:22:10 - 00:09:39:06
不明
Robust compliance, governance and scalability. And those are tools to democratize assets, to brand prove assets to more users, to force to collaborations and reuse of content in their.

00:09:39:08 - 00:10:18:04
不明
This may already sound a lot of what the dam can and is supposed to, but at the dhobi, our vision for a dam actually goes beyond to just a core dam or the foundation of a dam. What we and many of our customers believe and are looking for as the most important value of a dam, is the ability to enrich the content currently living into that, to transform brand and prove that content into winning content, and to activate this winning content to where the users and customers are.

00:10:18:06 - 00:10:46:21
不明
And these activations of content will, at the end, drive tangible business outcomes like conversions for the organization. This slide illustrates our Dam vision that just spoke to you have the robust core dam sitting as the foundation and then selling on top are the five key ingredients that we have defined for winning strategy to successfully activate content from the ingestion to the delivery.

00:10:46:24 - 00:11:16:05
不明
All these powered by intelligent AI and junior infused composable services. In other. Know I was zooming to each of the five ingredients of content activation by talking to some of the common challenges we observed and our approach to solve those. This is not a product roadmap or innovation sessions, so I won't go into specific product features or functionalities, but hopefully you have attended a wash.

00:11:16:05 - 00:11:35:26
不明
The Summit mainstage session and have already seen some of the exciting key innovations coming out. I will also show you a list of other summit sessions at the end of the presentation, and I definitely recommend you to check those out later and available. So the first ingredient is discover.

00:11:35:28 - 00:12:22:20
不明
If you are then platform under a need or library, it. And at the same time you a parent like myself. I'm sure this slide is either bringing you a laugh or a nightmare, as how difficult it is to teach your kids to tidy up the room is to get your stakeholders to adopt and consistently use them properly. It is not uncommon to hear complaints from users about not knowing how to navigate or use the time, or they can find a particular piece of asset, and the problem gets even worse as the content grows, as more and more content being created in store, and attempt managing and finding the right content becomes increasingly difficult.

00:12:22:22 - 00:12:49:24
不明
And what we envision the better way the content discovery is through a single pane of glass approach. So first, imagine all content is accessible from a single interface or unified a surfacing layer of all content. And when I say all content, it does not only refer to assets stored in the core them, but all different repositories sitting in different teams and departments across the organization.

00:12:49:27 - 00:13:26:23
不明
So now users have one single go to place to find content, but they may still be stuck with legacy way of searching and sorting assets usually limited to tax and key works only. But imagine in this era of Gen, the AI and the AI, you can actually discover content with new search capabilities like natural language search. You can type in the text prompt like you do it in a lot of JNI tools these days, and they will analyze your probe to find out the context and intent of your search and return with most relevant results.

00:13:26:25 - 00:13:45:06
不明
This power of Janai does not stop here. It can further optimize your search results and help identify if there are duplicate assets in the dam, or help you locate all the similar content that you can also use for you. Rather than campaign.

00:13:45:08 - 00:13:51:07
不明
Next ingredient is governance.

00:13:51:10 - 00:14:34:01
不明
I love speaking with customers, and this slide is based on a real tragic story that I heard from a dam librarian in a recent dam industry event in Europe. Her company is one of the biggest aviation travel companies in Europe, and they have deployed an enterprise dam, which has just gone live less than two years ago. Imagine a global company like hers only has one single librarian in the whole organization, and she basically needs to single handedly support all the user requests related to melted management, and have checked tagging of assets as a graph and engine authorizations as all this and usage rate configuration, just to name a fail.

00:14:34:04 - 00:15:00:02
不明
Unfortunately, with the macroeconomic climate and most enterprises talking about do more with less these days. The hope to get a few extra pair of hands to help her is is really, really minimal. And what's even worse, there are more organizations and users trying to create content with Janai this days that is creating even more pressure and risk to businesses from a compliance standpoint.

00:15:00:04 - 00:15:30:06
不明
That is why you should have robust trust in governance embedded in to support the organization. If not, the librarian. So metadata is the key to ensure assets are discoverable. But tagging can be a very granular, time and time consuming job. AI driven a lot of tagging or sometimes it's been caught. More texts have been available as the technology for years, and with the recent development of AI and Genii, this sort of smart techs are just becoming smarter and more accurate.

00:15:30:08 - 00:16:03:21
不明
And eventually it is going to be capable to identify not only particular attributes and territories takes of an asset, but also be enabled to generate and apply texts that reflect meaning, usage, and more things of the essence or even brand aware text, all based on trainings and content analysis. Also, powered by the advanced metadata applied to the content does not only help with discoverability of the content, but also more granular control of assets of content.

00:16:03:24 - 00:16:44:23
不明
You can apply rule based asset rules based on metadata attributes in addition to traditionally folder based access control. So to ensure that particularly content is accessible strictly by authorized users. And imagine an AI agent in the dam can help automatically scan assets for legal compliance and brand requirements. Identify whether an asset is created with a gender AI tool, and apply the label or content credentials to it, and, if necessary, to enforce dynamic usage rights and restrictions based on evolving contracts and licensing.

00:16:44:25 - 00:17:21:09
不明
This will help organizations scale the content, but at the same time protect brand integrity and compliance, making sure all ongoing content are coming from a trusted source. Next is optimize. Optimization is key to make content effective and adaptable across multiple platforms. This slide and the numbers tell you we understand and feel the pain of our customers. Because this is an example of a very old Adobe global marketing organization.

00:17:21:11 - 00:17:44:14
不明
Our one global studio team is supporting the creation of all the campaign assets and banners for all our online social campaigns and channels, marketing events, etc.. So we are talking about hundreds of thousands of assets being produced annually, and this is growing year on year. So how to make sure everyone is on the same page and collaborate on creation.

00:17:44:16 - 00:18:02:12
不明
Scaled creation of content variations for specific segments, channels, locations and down to devices, and how to repurpose brand approved assets to maximize the reuse and utilization are all challenging tasks.

00:18:02:14 - 00:18:46:27
不明
So now imagine a dam with AI powered tools building to support both creatives and marketers to automatically produce and recommend high quality, personalized content tailored to specific audience segments and channels. It works like a content advisor or also an assembler for the team, and it does not only improve the content productivity of the organization, but also increase the content online and ensure brand integrity as only the best performance content and the most brand and legally compliant assets will be chosen to repurpose and produce new content and content after being assembled.

00:18:46:29 - 00:19:29:01
不明
Should also be optimized and adapted easily or automatically to different formats for dedicated channels like social media, emails, websites or imagine one single template of assets stored in the them can automatically populate into thousands, if not millions, of personalized variations on the fly, and the dam shall also provide an intuitive interface, almost like a cozy meeting place for all content stakeholders, both internally like marketing teams and externally like partners and agencies to collaborate and maximize the value of each asset.

00:19:29:03 - 00:20:01:08
不明
Nexus deliver. If there is one ingredient, then I really want to emphasize in relation to content activation, it is definitely deliver a more than damn shelf longer. Be a graveyard or final destination for assets. When an organization's decide to invest in a tech stack like a dam. The priority should not be how to get assets into to them anymore, but how to get the assets out of the them to the customers.

00:20:01:11 - 00:20:32:00
不明
Because this is what and how the assets on the platform actually bring business values to the organization. Common challenges we have seen that hinders the delivery of content from the dam include the lack of seamless workflow and integration with channels, inability to handle huge volume of assets and diverse type of assets like high definition images, videos, 3D shoppable media, and definitely poor delivery performance.

00:20:32:02 - 00:20:59:22
不明
So to effectively get your brain approved assets out and start getting value from the content at them shall be able to connect to various downstream applications and deliver approved assets directly from the dam. So, to ensure that assets being delivered to the customers are always up to date, brand approved and of highest quality. And for sure, enterprises should not compromise security for the sake of performance.

00:20:59:24 - 00:21:27:17
不明
So a dam, despite being able to deliver assets to any channel, should also provide advanced access control and secure delivery options to make sure only the right asset will be delivered to the right user or new audience group at the right time, and the right channel and delivery of high quality, which sometimes means high resolution assets, can be tricky due to constraints like bandwidth and user location.

00:21:27:19 - 00:22:00:25
不明
But imagine and they are infused. Dam can help automatically detect and transform assets to the optimal format and size for the dedicated channels or customer touchpoints. Regardless of all the variable factors, the delivery of assets is always performance to ensure the best customer engagement and conversion. So the last piece of the five is to understand. And in simplest speaking, it is all about data and insights.

00:22:00:27 - 00:22:25:00
不明
It is about understanding the content, usage and performance. It is about what are the hero content and assets that is bringing money on the table. And I would say it actually sales easier than that. It's because if you have missed some of the foundational pieces in the process, the capturing of data can be much more difficult than you would have imagined.

00:22:25:02 - 00:22:56:22
不明
For example, inconsistent or incomplete metadata may limit the visibility or accuracy of asset usage. Disconnect a system can bring challenges to getting the signal aware and how the assets are delivered, and it may, at the end, become a time consuming job that involved several teams just to manually grab the data. So let's get the basics right. As mentioned earlier, metadata is the key.

00:22:56:24 - 00:23:24:10
不明
Having AI to help with capturing and generating granular metadata, plus a robust and customizable metadata service in the data, can ensure that you have all the necessary trackers or signals to ensure the accuracy of the asset usage and performance. Also mentioned before, the importance of having them connected with all the downstream channels and if possible, the entire content ecosystem in the organization.

00:23:24:12 - 00:23:51:14
不明
Only if all workflows are seamlessly connected, that you will be unable to capture all the performance data, every piece of assets with the most minimal effort. And last but not least, having all the assets insights is important. But it is not the last of an asset journey. An end to end content journey should not be linear, but recurrent.

00:23:51:16 - 00:24:22:26
不明
Bring approved assets are leaving assets, not time, and by capturing all the data and convert it into insights, the Dem can again use some help of GI content advisor to take that one step further by recommending winning content for your next campaign based on past performance of the assets, and it can help assemble this best assets into new, winning content for fast activation.

00:24:22:28 - 00:24:49:02
不明
So I covered a lot about a vision of them and the five key ingredients of content activation. Before I wrap up, I also want to bring up a couple of key resources of a future ready team. So now you can tell, despite a product marketer all the damn and most home code right? So the first secret sauce is metadata.

00:24:49:04 - 00:25:25:05
不明
I just cannot emphasize enough how important metadata is in ensuring a successful content strategy and performance of the assets and them as the platform. Sometimes when I spoke with some content and Dem strategies and industry events, we have jokingly, jokingly said metadata itself is even more important than the actual content. And in this ever changing content landscape, especially field with the presence of JNI, we should keep reminding ourselves that metadata is not something static.

00:25:25:07 - 00:26:01:16
不明
It should not stay as what it is at the time of ingestion, or when an essence is being uploaded. Metadata is a set of living labels that can span and travel through the content lifecycle, and a future ready them shall provide robust and comprehensive metadata capabilities, including, but not limited to, customizable metadata schema at Barnes, the metadata management and automation and AI powered functionalities to help reduce it, not eliminate many work of tagging.

00:26:01:18 - 00:26:42:14
不明
The second secret sauce, actually not quite a secret, is definitely I. In here. I'm not only just referring to what people commonly think about using genealogy to create new assets like images or videos, but more about how genius is in inferencing or infused in the whole content lifecycle. I can actually help maintain as a governance by and identifying ensuring brand standards, enhancing search experiences with capabilities like natural language search or semantic search that understand the intent of the users and them being the single source of truth of all brand.

00:26:42:14 - 00:27:15:28
不明
And the content can also be combed content. Look for training and organizations on custom AI model about the tone and style of the brand, and the model can later be leveraged to generate consistent on brand content and different variations of scale and feature. And last but definitely not least, leveraging the latest agenda AI to be the content advisor to evaluate, recommend and assemble content to be personalized and delivered to every single customer.

00:27:15:28 - 00:27:33:18
不明
Touchpoint. So in short, if I have to summarize what the future ready them should look like with a product lens, he is a list of core things I will look at and evaluate.

00:27:33:20 - 00:28:17:06
不明
And as I said, this is not a product session. So not until now. And finally mentioning our very own damn Adobe Experience Manager assets or EMS that usually being cop out them is purposely built to solve all the challenges I outlined and support. This reinvented the ambition that I have presented in this session. Adobe Experience manage your assets as a cloud native and AI for enterprise that have already been helping many of the world's biggest brands to solve the content challenges, enable the organization's end to end content supply chain, and achieved tangible and significant business values and results.

00:28:17:08 - 00:28:49:20
不明
I'm not going through this lie by light, as I'm sure you're already reading this while I'm speaking and already amazed by the results. If you are still intrigued by what I shared with you today and want to hear more about the solution and some other customer stories, there are some other sessions about MSR at summit this year. If by any chance you are now in Vegas for summit, make sure you don't miss these sessions and our demo book.

00:28:49:22 - 00:29:14:17
不明
And if you are sitting at home watching this now, no worries, most of the session will be made available on demand shortly after the event. And for sure, I'm more than happy to connect with you on LinkedIn and we can have a chat about my always favorite topic, them and content supply chain. And with that, thank you so much for watching this session.

00:29:14:19 - 00:29:22:20
不明
I hope to meet you in person at the next Adobe Summit or other industry events very soon. Have a damn good rest of your day.
