00:00:00:00 - 00:00:25:58
不明
Thank you for joining us. We're going to have we're going to have some fun today. We have a very serious topic topic to talk about, of course, and that is how we leverage the AI revolution and the age of a genetic in marketing all the way from create to activate. It's a very serious topic. But we think it's important that when you address serious topics that you have some fun doing it.

00:00:25:58 - 00:00:53:08
不明
So we're glad that you're along for the ride. You're coming down the rabbit hole for us. Got a stellar panel assembled here today, and they're going to join us on this on this, ride today. Why are we using Alice and the story of Alice in Wonderland as a as a metaphor? Here's why. Alice in this metaphor is the customer, and she is overwhelmed.

00:00:53:13 - 00:01:22:50
不明
She is getting facing this barrage of marketing messages. She's being put on journeys that she doesn't actually even want to be on. And so the question is, how can we get her out of this rabbit hole and back into some sense of reality where she feels like she's in control? That's the mission that we as creators and as marketing have, because it's really an obligation that we have, I believe, to our customers and in this case, to Alice.

00:01:22:55 - 00:01:48:33
不明
That's where we're going going down the rabbit hole today. This is the time to pick up your phones because we are going to pop up the first question. We just want to level set another mindset that, this audience has as it relates to leveraging AI in the world of marketing. There we go. So which persona best describes how you feel about the potential of AI in marketing?

00:01:48:37 - 00:02:12:22
不明
Are you the White Rabbit who is overwhelmed but enthusiastic about it? Are you the Cheshire Cat? The Cheshire strategist who is cautiously optimistic? Or are you the Mad Hatter who is bold and reckless and wants to experiment with abandoned? Or are you off with their heads? The Red Queen traditionalist, the AI skeptic? What do you think? Who are you?

00:02:12:26 - 00:02:53:55
不明
None of the last one. That's crazy. We have no skeptics here. Well, that may be a, kind of, the bias of this audience. They did after all, select to be in this in this session with us today. Interesting. That's kind of where I, expected it to be. It's following a normal distribution, I guess if you discount D as an option with cautiously optimistic as being the kind of the prevailing position that people have right now, I think that actually accurately reflects what I've seen and heard throughout the, throughout, summit this week to everyone is maybe cautiously optimistic and also curious about what, this technology is actually about.

00:02:54:00 - 00:03:20:11
不明
But more importantly, what is the impact that the technology can have on their, their brand and the performance of their marketing operations? So I'm going to introduce the panel right now, and then we're going to do a quick demo. And then then what we're going to do, the way the flow will be is I have six truths that I've identified that I believe characterize kind of the the imperative for marketers in in the age of AI.

00:03:20:11 - 00:03:42:43
不明
And we're going to have a just a little friendly debate here amongst the panelists, on, whether or not these truths actually stand on their own or whether they should be revised. At the end of today, I'm going to show you another QR code, which allows you to send us an email. And the promise if you send me an email, this course goes to my personal inbox.

00:03:42:55 - 00:04:01:33
不明
I'm going to send you back the results of the of the surveys that we took here, but also a synthesis of our of our findings here. So we're going to we have this point of view established right now. But what I'd like to do with this group here is we're going to co-create. We're going to we're going to refine this point of view.

00:04:01:42 - 00:04:22:34
不明
Maybe what I've come up with is accurate. I am Lewis Carroll. I am a genius. But there may be some, room for editing as well. So with that, Carly, would you introduce yourself? Thank you for joining us today. Thank you for having me. Yes. The Queen of hearts. Yeah. Hi. So my name is Carly Board.

00:04:22:38 - 00:04:52:07
不明
I am the product leader at T-Mobile. And I oversee our contextual experience product, and really, that just means all of the martech systems that come together to help us better personalize across our channels. So I've worked with Adobe for a very long time, have a great partnership with P.W., C, and I'm, you know, my responsibility is is really looking at across the AI landscape how we can pull that in, from data to platform to, to better personalize for our customers.

00:04:52:12 - 00:05:10:23
不明
I love it. And Carly is going to keep us honest because Carly was very, very clear when we were prepping for this panel discussion. Hey, I'm not a technologist. But we need that. We need someone who actually is skeptical about the technology and actually speaks for, the customer. And what is the ideal experience that we built for her?

00:05:10:28 - 00:05:32:37
不明
And speaking of building, we've got one of our, AI partners here, writer in the form of Kevin Chang, the head of strategy. Kevin. So I'm bold and reckless, and I have to be as a as a builder, writer, as a generative AI company targeted towards enterprises, we scale and build applications for enterprises. We're now probably over 10,000 applications live in production.

00:05:32:42 - 00:05:50:24
不明
And we serve all types of industries, including, big tech, retail, CPG, financial services, health care. Excited to partner with see in Adobe and, you know, working very closely with T-Mobile as well. So excited to be here with you guys. Thanks for joining us, Kev. And it's okay if you want to take these hats off. But they were they were a great photo op to begin with.

00:05:50:29 - 00:05:59:24
不明
Well now my hair's all messed up. So yeah that hair right. This hair could not take a hat today. No I was looking too good. Face.

00:05:59:29 - 00:06:17:24
不明
Hi. Emotion. What's an AI lead versus strategy and operations for, Adobe. Between our gen studio and five play services product, I just saw that I'm the Queen of hearts, which is labeled as a skeptic. I wouldn't quite have my job if I was any skeptic, so just wanted to say I'm probably more AI white. The White Rabbit.

00:06:17:29 - 00:06:35:06
不明
But we lead, we have multiple customers. We have T-Mobile, we have partners like Ryder that we work with, that we work with really closely as well. So really excited to be here and talking, talking to all of you. Awesome. Thank you for joining us. And thank you for the partnership. And last but not least, my friend and partner Roberto.

00:06:35:06 - 00:07:05:04
不明
And on this I tell us, White Rabbit, are you late, late, late. I was going to say I'm the rabbit, but you just stole my my thunder. We're all rabbits on this. I'm just a guy, running crazy fast. Yeah. Innovation for the customer transformation practice at, B2C. Thanks for joining us. Okay. And, so before we get into these, these truths that I, that I mentioned, I'm actually going to, ask Roberto to to do a little, little demo for, for us.

00:07:05:04 - 00:07:23:01
不明
And it's, he's going to take us down the rabbit hole and we're going to meet someone named Alice. Would you like to introduce her demos? Sounds pretty boring, particularly at 409. Vegas. Time on. What is it today? Wednesday. We're going to have a party with us. So, what we are going to do is, live broadcast.

00:07:23:06 - 00:07:41:57
不明
Alice couldn't be with us today, so she's joining us from Wonderland, and she's pretty intrigued about this discussion. So, is it okay if I just give her a call? Yeah, let's let's have her join the conversation. I just hope that she's not very moody today. Hey, Alice. How are you?

00:07:42:01 - 00:08:03:10
不明
Oh, what a curious greeting I am. Quite well, though I do wonder, is one ever truly just well? Or are we always a little bit curious, a little bit cross, a little bit like a tea party that never quite ends? Tell me what's been stirring in your wonderland today. So we just started there. A very interesting panel here at Adobe Summit.

00:08:03:23 - 00:08:29:22
不明
So I want you to, just tell us as, customer, what do you think, Alice, about the role that marketing should play in conjunction with generative AI to create experiences that are delightful to customers like you? Oh, Roberto, what a splendid question. It's like asking what the Cheshire Cat thinks of disappearing. It all depends on the grin.

00:08:29:22 - 00:08:51:54
不明
Doesn't it? If marketing is to be truly delightful with generative AI, it should be like a garden in wonderland full of unexpected blooms and curious paths. It should know my whims before I do, anticipate my needs with a wink, and perhaps even tell a riddle or two. But tell me, Roberto, do you think this garden should be perfectly manicured?

00:08:52:06 - 00:09:32:08
不明
Or should it have a touch of delightful chaos like a mad Hatter's tea party? So I'll leave that question to the panelists and you can talk to them later. But before we go into the panel, Alice, just help me with something else. Imagine that you were back in London and you wanted to go shoe shopping. So as you learn more about what these generative AI thing is all about and, you think about your shoe shopping adventure, what would you expect as you walk into a shoe store in the way in which, brands leverage generative AI to create a delightful experience for you?

00:09:32:13 - 00:10:08:04
不明
Shoe shopping. A most excellent quest, indeed. If generative AI were to be my guide, I'd expect something far more enchanting than simply rows of shoes. First, imagine stepping into a shop where the very air seems to shimmer with possibilities. The I would know my size, of course, but more than that it would understand my style. Perhaps it would conjure up images of shoes that match a dress I wore just last Tuesday, or suggest boots perfect for a wonderland adventure based on my expressed desire for practicality and whimsy.

00:10:08:09 - 00:10:30:42
不明
But tell me, Roberto, should this, I also offer me a riddle to solve before revealing the perfect pair. I know you really want me to, play with riddles right now, Alice, but we are going to get back to the panel. We might come back to you a little bit later. Okay. Thank you for joining us. How about a hand for Alice, everybody?

00:10:30:46 - 00:10:33:36
不明
Yeah.

00:10:33:41 - 00:10:58:05
不明
Roberto was right, of course, when? When he corrected me. When I. When I used the word demo, it was a demo. Would suggest that something is, pre scripted. This was not so we built we built a model called Alice. But we did not actually preordained what the questions would be. We did not, even know exactly what words would come back from Alice.

00:10:58:10 - 00:11:25:50
不明
I catch myself calling her a her, by the way, even though I know it's bits and bytes. But, anyway, that I think it's just a great example of the, the pace of the innovation that we're seeing right now in the creative applications of those innovation. We also got some ideas from Alice in terms of how experience design can really change things for the brands that that we all represent.

00:11:25:55 - 00:11:55:10
不明
So as I said before, Alice is overwhelmed by all this, mixed messaging that she's experiencing. But but most importantly, again, I want to emphasize the point that is not just about this. This the sense of, overwhelm is but it's this, this notion that she's not in control. And I think the obligation that we as marketers and technologists who support marketers and creatives have is that we should put her back in control.

00:11:55:10 - 00:12:23:10
不明
We should be willing to cede control so that she feels like she owns her journey and, has control over the choice of which brands she chooses to interact and transact with. So that's what we're going to talk about, is what can we do to leverage what, we refer to as the experience supply chain so that we can get Alice back in control.

00:12:23:15 - 00:12:51:41
不明
All right. I'm going to start with a huge number that is this came out of the last week I study which suggested that I is going to add 16 trillion. As with a tea to the global economy by 2030. That's a massive, massive number. We as marketers are all about growth. So this 16 trillion is the opportunity that we as marketers have to create.

00:12:51:41 - 00:13:16:32
不明
So the question is, okay, how do we capitalize on this opportunity and take as much of that 16 trillion and consume it for our brands as possible. And so with that, we come to the first truth, which I'm going to first posit to Carly and ask her to comment on, and that is that leveraging AI in the content supply chain and external experience, supply chain is the new frontier for marketers.

00:13:16:37 - 00:13:39:37
不明
True, true, okay. Tell us print your perspective as an experienced designer. Yeah. So I mean, I think the days of just kind of building segments and targeting mass numbers of customers is changing. I don't think that fits the bill anymore. Customers are expecting their interactions to be personalized and true to them. And customers know that this technology exists.

00:13:39:37 - 00:14:06:31
不明
And when they're interfacing with brands, you know, they're expecting that level of personalization. And it's not just some single touchpoints. It's leveraging AI to seamlessly guide them through journeys. And we know that humans are multifaceted beings, and we're not always on a singular journey. We're on multiple journeys at the time. You know, at T-Mobile, we are really focused on, you know, we're we're a huge telecom communication company.

00:14:06:36 - 00:14:25:12
不明
We're going through a digital transformation. You know, really going from traditional brick and mortar retail, into more digital space and without really bringing in AI to help guide those journeys, because it's not just about selling things for us. You know, we have our network, we have our offerings, we have our service, and customers really count on us.

00:14:25:12 - 00:14:48:03
不明
And so we need those real time signals to understand how, like what the customers need from us in real time so we can meet that need proactively so they aren't calling our care up to ask about their network. We know it before they do. And so I think it's just again, like really making sure that you have the right signals and you have the right data and you're actually listening to your customers, whether it be when, when they're actually calling you.

00:14:48:03 - 00:15:08:08
不明
But all the intent that they're showing is they're interacting online, offline retail, and making sure that you're leveraging the data to understand that that same customer that walked in the front door yesterday is the same customer that walked in the back door today. Right. And so you have to have that unified view. And I think from the experience as you're designing experience, like I can really help.

00:15:08:13 - 00:15:41:53
不明
It's not about campaign here. Campaign there. We're going to talk to this customer in that channel. You need to leverage AI to adapt to how that customer wants to be to, to be branded to, to be sold to, to be, you know, helped, in a, in a certain situation. So yeah, I think the potential that's so interesting right now is that we as we, as we engage with those listening signals, the, the way of marketing may even just two years ago would have been we we use that in order to slot them into a predefined customer journey.

00:15:41:58 - 00:16:03:50
不明
Now what AI lies allows us to do is actually create the journey. That is truly a case of one. So I know you've been on the forefront innovating with, Gen studio for performance marketing, which which allows us to do just that to, to personalize content so that the, the, the looks, the feel, the experience actually really is unique.

00:16:03:50 - 00:16:26:19
不明
Tell us a little bit more about just your view on this new imperative for marketers. Yeah, I want to say two things. I think the first one is, every transformational journey is a long one and a really painful one. So just want to acknowledge that finding clarity with AI is a journey we're all on as much as we are on the product side, building these products, we are also customer zero for ourselves, and we're going through this journey.

00:16:26:24 - 00:16:48:19
不明
And what we're realizing is there's a three step, sort of three phased approach that we're thinking about the way we start about, the way we start thinking about this is with the first, vector of efficiency, right? Like we have content supply chain. We've been shaping this narrative around how do we bring all of the Adobe suite of products to actually address the bottlenecks in the content supply chain?

00:16:48:34 - 00:17:08:24
不明
And the thing that was always missing is like, we do not have enough content. Right? And the response to that was always like, how do we go back and make content more discoverable and reusable? And now with generative AI, we can take that and scale it without, you know, sort of incurring very heavy costs. So how do you put more content out there, more effective content out there?

00:17:08:24 - 00:17:38:29
不明
So that's sort of the first phase of efficiency. The second one we're starting to think about now is innovation. Like as a marketer, to your point, for we're going from a place where the the ad side, the supply side is sort of pushing ads to what is the customer want? How are they pulling us? How do you tell a story that is appealing to the customer in a way, in a in a channel where they're at and in a messaging that resonates with them and this is where we are starting to think about bringing the concept of the content, the data and the journeys together.

00:17:38:43 - 00:17:55:22
不明
And the journeys are no longer linear either. Like in a lot of industries, you have to acquire the customer, but you have to retain the customer. Sometimes you have to reacquire the customer and keep building that loyalty. So how do you think about using AI as an innovation lever to do that? As the second phase and the final one is the complete transformation, right?

00:17:55:22 - 00:18:16:57
不明
Like, what could marketing look three years from now, like five years from now? None of us know, right? Like the is the talent stack the same? Is the technology different? Like, do we have the same channels? All of these questions are up in the air after like ten years of working cloud transformation and digital transformation. Now it's like this, this next vector of transformation that we're entering.

00:18:17:11 - 00:18:36:51
不明
And this is a paradigm that none of us are used to because fundamentally the technology is non-deterministic. So how can you actually leverage the power of it, not treat it as a bug, but more as a feature and a delightful way to actually bring unique experiences and innovate and sort of transform ourselves as brands. That's what we spend a lot of time thinking about.

00:18:36:55 - 00:19:09:31
不明
Way to drop the word vector twice. They're so effortlessly technical, so, especially because, you know, vector art, Adobe, all that stuff. Hey, speaking of, art that's created, with, with Gen I, all the images that you're seeing on these slides were in fact created with Adobe fireflies. So kudos to Adobe for the incredible innovation. But I want to also tell you that when we created the graphics that were going to go on this slide, I spent a lot of time with a creative to do that.

00:19:09:36 - 00:19:34:07
不明
I'm not a creative, I came up with this concept, but I needed to work with someone who was a real artist to create these beautiful images that we see here. He used the tool that was Firefly, but he did not defer to Firefly to create. And we we co-created it over the over the course of multiple iterations to arrive at what you see here.

00:19:34:12 - 00:19:56:13
不明
And so that to me is emblematic of this notion of, keeping, as we've heard on stage multiple times this week to the human in the center of what what we do with AI and in creative and, and in marketing. And so that brings us to the second, truth, which is which is all about putting the customer at the center.

00:19:56:13 - 00:20:23:57
不明
So empowering the customer with transparency, trust and control in AI powered journeys is the mission for marketers right now. One of our, loyalty studies showed that even loyal customers, will leave a brand that they've been fond of to the tune of 32%, just based on one bad experience. So the question to the panel is, what?

00:20:24:01 - 00:20:42:55
不明
What can we do to prevent that one bad experience so that we, as they should, saying we don't to reacquire a customer who was already hard earned? It's got to take on that. Yeah, I can jump in on that. And I would love to hear from you on this from the T-Mobile side. So I think brand obviously is super important.

00:20:42:55 - 00:21:01:21
不明
And one of the things I remember early on, like maybe 2 or 3 years ago, when you're talking about Genii, people are like holding the technology to a higher standard than that. We hold like our own employees. It was like, it cannot be wrong at all. It has to be 100% accurate. And the question we would always ask is, what would you like?

00:21:01:21 - 00:21:21:48
不明
Say that about an employee. If an employee made a mistake, would you fire them immediately? And the answer was always no. And so but one of the things that ended up once we got over that hurdle was actually, did you know that AI doesn't get tired? It can work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It can continue to optimize, look at brands, really actually create that transparency.

00:21:21:48 - 00:21:46:06
不明
And so as people got more comfortable, they realized actually what it's really powerful at doing, which is consistency, driving that reliability. And so what brands can now do is they can actually get a workforce of 10,000 people, 100,000 people to all actually represent the brand in exactly the same way. Right. And so AI is now enabling us to do that through the power of being able to understand a brand, understand compliance.

00:21:46:06 - 00:22:05:22
不明
But it goes beyond just brand. It's like legal compliance. And pharma, for example, like we can actually create content that is matched against FDA guidelines. And some of these FDA guidelines are like thousands of pages, like there's no human is going to read that and try to interpret it. So, right now that's almost table stakes. Now it's like we can actually create that brand consistency.

00:22:05:25 - 00:22:23:49
不明
And the transparency as a result of that is, you know, we're getting higher quality with more with more consistency across the board. Yeah. And I think that's interesting. So we are working with writer, and some of our service space because again like T-Mobile is a telecom we are an essential service. We also sell, you know, Wi-Fi.

00:22:23:49 - 00:22:44:22
不明
We sell phones, we sell all the things, and off of which we can live without. Right. Well, and oftentimes I think marketers immediately go to sales, like, obviously. Yes, we have revenue goals. Like that's why we're in a capitalist market. Like we have to do the thing. But for us, it's like, and I think I like the you touched on brand, it's it's every time a customer interacts with you, it is an extension of your brand.

00:22:44:22 - 00:23:13:03
不明
And how can you leverage AI to make sure that you're staying on brand, staying on voice because whether it be an agent or, you know, a bot in your chat or someone's an IVR and they're they're interacting with an AI bought like they don't think about that as operations. They think about that as your brand. So making sure that all of the AI touchpoints and all the customer touchpoints are consistent and on brand is really important because a customer isn't thinking like, oh, well, you know, that automated payment or that automated upgrade is operations.

00:23:13:03 - 00:23:33:55
不明
It's part of the the holistic brand story. And I'm excited to, you know, they're really helping us stay on brand. And the work that we're doing is right. And that holistic is is what we're referring to as the experience supply chain. You talk about that a little bit, Roberto. What that means. Yeah. So be consistent. Absolutely compliant. Absolutely.

00:23:34:04 - 00:23:57:58
不明
But you use a word that I think that over the next couple of years we are going to have to rethink. Phil, that is the word control. And I think that long gone are going to be the days where brands should claim that they control the experience and that they know better than the customers that they are trying to serve effectively.

00:23:58:03 - 00:24:19:30
不明
Just think about the example that we were playing with, a few minutes ago with with Alice. And think about the power that brands are going to have with this amazing technology that is here. But even more amazing technology that is coming our way. We as consumers or customers are going to be able to define our own adventure.

00:24:19:35 - 00:24:44:22
不明
I always use this analogy. I used to love these books from back in the day. The Choose Your Own Adventure books. I don't know how many of you were familiar with them. That was a very analog way to pick an ending that was different than whatever the author had selected for you, and you could navigate that through that adventure by just going to different pages based on some decisions that you were making.

00:24:44:27 - 00:25:18:16
不明
Think about that with what is happening with AI and Genii today in particular. If I want to go shoe shopping with Alice, I'm going to be able to. I just spoke to someone that is an algorithm that sounded like Alice. I want to be able to go to a store and maybe, who knows if I'm the type of customer that likes the Alice in Wonderland characters, I might see some holograms that depict that, and they are the ones that, with the human in the loop, are going to be selling me, shoes, getting me through that, adventure.

00:25:18:25 - 00:25:44:36
不明
So the control needs to be on making sure that the technology is properly used, that the technology provides the level of consistency and compliance that is required. But we need to let go. We need to be orchestrators of experiences, not owners of experiences. On behalf of those customers, I was just going to say, something that happened last year that really caught attention for me is there was this particular airline that had a chat bot.

00:25:44:36 - 00:26:02:56
不明
I don't know if you guys were following the news. They got sued for a very small dollar amount, but I think it kind of said the industry backed by a few months. The technology's moving really fast. To Roberta's point, it's it's not about the technology anymore. It's about how do you leverage the best of the technology, but in the right way.

00:26:03:07 - 00:26:25:00
不明
So there's this paradigm of like testing trust, right? Like it's not just like software. You just don't throw it out there and expect it to work. It's because of that non-deterministic nature. You put a lot of guardrails around it. You ensure that you run multiple tests, even from a product building perspective. In Adobe, we have to run so many tests before we put it an AI capability into the market.

00:26:25:04 - 00:26:46:21
不明
Right. And there are people out there that are pushing features out the door. We're being more thoughtful, more careful. And that's because at the very crux of a lot of that is that concept of responsible AI that we've sort of so it's been at the heart of what we do from the way we source the training data for building Firefly to the way we release our products every single day.

00:26:46:26 - 00:27:06:12
不明
It's very, very thoughtful. There's a lot of testing. I would really, really encourage that. The people who are also buying these AI products out there to run their own set of tests before they trust, because today it is just a piece of software. Tomorrow it's an agent that is doing the work on behalf of your brand. So just really test and trust is how I would think about it.

00:27:06:19 - 00:27:35:47
不明
So I think you've all brought up the word brand in the last few minutes and and it, it reminds me that, what we do as marketers is, is work to enhance the brands. It's half of the job. We talk about performance marketing as being being the other half, but, when we when we talk about the adoption of AI in the enterprise, I think it introduces a lot of risk to your point about what would happen with that particular airline.

00:27:35:47 - 00:28:11:43
不明
It it introduces risk for the marketers that they're not in control of. Right now, because the entire enterprise, in one way or the other contributes to brand. It's not just marketing. And so this is there's an opportunity right now, which is also an obligation, I think, for marketers to actually assert themselves more throughout the enterprise and not just, curate and, protect the brand through marketing channels, but really through any aspect of the enterprise that manifests some kind of an interaction with the customers.

00:28:11:43 - 00:28:40:12
不明
And so that brings us to the the third truth, which is that managing the enterprise, the enterprise wide impact of AI on brand perception and on customer trust and business success is a marketer's duty. Kev, would you agree with that? And what are you doing to is there anything that, like Ryder as an example, is maybe just, an example of the industry is doing to get marketing and the rest of the enterprise in sync to, I would say, a truth, but with a caveat.

00:28:40:12 - 00:29:02:33
不明
I think, you know, as, as you if you represent a company or you work at a company, we're all marketers and to, to some degree of that brand. So it's really everybody's responsibility. We actually just issued, a survey this week that talked about who's actually the owner of AI in an organization. And we found that it was, well, the first thing we the headline was more like your employees or sabotaging your AI strategy.

00:29:02:33 - 00:29:19:10
不明
And the interesting when you dig into it a little bit more, it's not because that they don't want AI to work, they actually just don't think that the organization is aligned on how to run the AI strategy. They've got the CIO building some stuff, and the business owners like, I don't want to use that crap. You just built me because it doesn't work.

00:29:19:10 - 00:29:43:01
不明
So I'm going to use my credit card and buy something else. And so but the whole point of that, survey was really just to align on the fact that everybody actually wants the AI to work, they just want to make sure that it's aligned and that it actually does work and performs what it wants to do. And so the big thing that we see, I think the big opportunity we have in the market around being able to use that is actually how do we scale it to a degree that people can start to really leverage it.

00:29:43:01 - 00:29:56:25
不明
So I'll give you an example of what we're seeing when we talked about like control and where we're seeing things going. So you know, about two years ago a lot of AI was like, I just want to use it to super power my work. Like, I have all this stuff that I have to do in my day. It's manual.

00:29:56:27 - 00:30:12:01
不明
I want to do it. Can I just do it for me? Can I answer my emails? Can I write this thing that I have to do? Can it summarize this meeting I had? So that was all of the the good stuff that came out initially as we moved to the next phase. It was sort of like, okay, can it start to do a little bit more for me?

00:30:12:09 - 00:30:32:24
不明
Right? Can it start to reason logic, and can it actually start to come up with creative thought? So then we got to that phase. Now, as you guys know, the hype word in AI is agenda genetic, right? We're all hear in about a genetic. So a genetic means different things to different people. But in the enterprise and what we're seeing is people are saying, well, I have not only one task.

00:30:32:24 - 00:30:53:21
不明
I have a chain of 30 tasks that needs to happen. And I'm always sort of looking at each one, or I need multiple people to get involved in it. What if I could actually have I help me facilitate and complete all of these tasks at once, right. It's kind of a crazy thing. So one of the workflows we built for a fortune ten company was they wanted to launch a new product.

00:30:53:25 - 00:31:09:34
不明
They needed to, launch it from a brand new thing. So they actually created a concept in Firefly of an image of what the packaging would look like. The packaging had the label, all the names, the, you know, traditional facts of what this product was is it was a it was a product that you could it was like a vitamin product.

00:31:09:34 - 00:31:30:02
不明
Right? What they were able to do was they were literally like, I'm only going to do one step. I'm going to put the image of this product into my dam. So they put it in box, right? It kicked off a workflow that basically created all the content and salsify product description. It translated into 30 languages. It made sure it was SEO optimized.

00:31:30:07 - 00:31:51:52
不明
It actually rebranded, the guidelines so they could sell on Amazon. That was different from Walmart. That was different than their intercom. It pushed it into Am and basically was like, okay, I'm ready to publish that. The person didn't have to do anything but upload the image into a dam so that was basically the steps to create multiple workflows, agender workflows.

00:31:51:57 - 00:32:14:36
不明
And we're already at that reality today. Right, to be able to do that. So basically we've created something that's done 99% of something that would normally create take, take like a week for somebody to do. So the what we'll be talking about a year from now is just going to be incredible progress from there. Oh, 99%. But Kali experience design is still going to be important.

00:32:14:38 - 00:32:32:52
不明
We still need the human in the process. Totally. And I think, you know, just speaking very blatantly like we we've had an adoption problem within our marketing team because I think I has become so ubiquitous that it's almost become meaningless in some people's minds. I know for me, because like, you know, my title is kind of ambiguous, like contextual experiences.

00:32:32:52 - 00:33:00:52
不明
What? What does that mean? Right. Personalization at scale. Cool. Well, people will start come to me like, oh, contextual AI, ML as if it's the same thing as if it's one word. And I'm like, well, no, it's different, right? AI is different than ML contextualize. You know, they all take and tie together, but you know, I think marketers specifically, especially when they've got goals around revenue and they're responsible for not only nurturing the customer experience, but making sure that it's critical touchpoints that they can meet their revenue or conversion goals.

00:33:00:57 - 00:33:25:39
不明
It's been top freight. Like you have to make sure that your models are good and they're trained. And so the marketers have the trust to take their hands off the wheel, and let the machine kind of do its thing. And that's the journey that we're on, right? We, we're like I said, we're there's a stated mission of, you know, data informed, AI enabled digital first for a telecom company that's like, we're on this.

00:33:25:44 - 00:33:51:05
不明
We're we're in a true digital transformation. At the same time that AI is just so hard to keep up. And so, yeah, I mean, I think it's me as the products I sit squarely in between the business and the marketing team, I'm in service to them and our data science and our technology teams. And so I'm constantly having to and it's an honor to kind of bring these solutions, but really make sure that the marketers understand, like we're not here to replace you.

00:33:51:05 - 00:34:12:39
不明
Like it's like use it as a tool to help free up your mind and your space to, to do the more strategic things. But yeah, I mean, I think adoption, people are so excited, but then there's so much out there, that I think there's a lot of skepticism, too. It's become kind of a buzzword, which is unfortunate because all of us on the stage, like we have our hands on it every day.

00:34:12:39 - 00:34:31:46
不明
So we see the power. How do we kind of message that and make people comfortable with that? It is a buzzword, but, kind of like if we were holding this conference, let's say the equivalent of this conference 27 years ago would have been the internet. Oh, yeah. And the World Wide Web is not now it's AI. It will become commonplace soon, but it isn't yet.

00:34:31:51 - 00:35:00:20
不明
We're still trying to figure that out. It can you you, you used, the phrase SEO, just now. I'm actually, I'm reading articles about, AIO optimizing for AI, not search engines, because the next truth is that the new reality for marketers is that they have to learn how to market with AI. Two AI.

00:35:00:25 - 00:35:20:04
不明
What a time to be alive. That's like, yeah, what a time to be alive. That's like some inception's inception shit right there. Where was I? I'm going to lean more false, I think. I think we will. There's somebody made a funny comment that there were like, now we're going to have, I like, write emails that other AI is going to read that email and like, literally we're not going to talk to each other.

00:35:20:09 - 00:35:36:46
不明
I mean, that's probably true at some point. But I do think, like where we are, we it's AI that's still going through human right. Like a lot of the stuff that, you know, Carly and I've been talking about with T-Mobile and stuff we've doing with other customers is like, we're using the AI to customize things. So it's going to be very specific for you, right?

00:35:36:46 - 00:36:01:30
不明
The journey of one. Right. So it's instead of it being you get this email and you're like what the emphasis emails don't even relatable to what I want. Now it's going to be very customized to you right. So I think it's going to be AI to humans, in a meaningful way, with certain exceptions, where, yes, obviously the computers will be talking to each other, but I think the customization piece is going to be very important for, for the time being.

00:36:01:30 - 00:36:18:25
不明
Right. It's like the AI is going to know exactly what you want. It's kind of like when you're on Instagram or TikTok, right? Like it knows exactly what you want to look at, right? The algorithm is like super good and it's like starting to get there. But we can do that in a better way with enterprise because we obviously don't want to get too much into the rabbit hole on that stuff.

00:36:18:25 - 00:36:42:18
不明
But if there's going to be significant stuff, that's going to be pretty important there. Rabbit hole. Nice. I actually think, I have a slightly different point of view on this. I think there will be a mixed scenario there. I think a lot of the content will be serving humans, but they will be increasing number of like the the there will be an increasing push towards marketing to the model providers.

00:36:42:23 - 00:37:04:39
不明
The reason being who wants to sit and read like 25 blue links of information, right? A lot of people are starting to adopt chat bots, because all you want to know is, how do I fix my problem, right? And so what is going to happen in my is just like early signs is you're the need for higher quality content is going to go up.

00:37:04:44 - 00:37:31:28
不明
And I think I would say from an SEO perspective, people sort of made that a little bit of an arc in a science, but it moved more and more towards keyword hacking instead of actually providing high quality insights and thought leadership in the market. And I think that bar will go up. So I'm excited to actually see brands step up and provide really high quality content that actually, to Kevin's point, caters to me, but it is routed through an Lem, right?

00:37:31:28 - 00:37:49:55
不明
So it needs to take a bit of both. Yeah, it's a little bit of book. It's more of a mixed bag at this point. Yeah. And Phil, the the interaction is going to change right. To me this is not about machines talking to machines and taking us out of that equation. But, let me ask the audience who knows who Tony Stark is.

00:37:50:00 - 00:38:18:42
不明
Raise your hand if you know what Tony Stark is. Keep your hand up. If you would like to have your own version of Jarvis, we all do. Right? Do you want, to shop for something? And the two options are. I have my version of Jarvis that helps him with that shopping. Or I want to get emails and continue to scroll through websites and apps until the end of days.

00:38:18:46 - 00:38:35:52
不明
And the last time I checked, for those of you that raise your hand and know who Tony Stark is, he was still the cool dude in that movie, right? It was not Jarvis taking over the world, although at some point he tried the experience. He's going to change, but the human is going to be part of that experience.

00:38:36:01 - 00:38:59:33
不明
But the experience is going to be incredibly more delightful thanks to the use of that technology, thanks to really moving away from, the environment that we have today into something that truly leverages, technology in that direction with, with this, I don't know how many of you have with the book by Reid Hoffman that he just published, a few weeks ago called the, Super Agency.

00:38:59:38 - 00:39:42:18
不明
One of my favorite parts of that book is the story that he tells at the beginning of the book where he tells, how, Socrates, used to hate books. And that's why you cannot find anything that, Socrates ever wrote unless you go and read Plato and the whole story is that that Socrates didn't like books because he felt it was gonna assign too much power to the people that were eventually gonna get access to those manuscripts, and that he would lose control of that experience because he didn't know who was going to get access to those manuscripts.

00:39:42:18 - 00:40:16:03
不明
So why was he going to be showing his wisdom in a place that he couldn't really fully, control? And I think that we're going to be talking about the same here is going to be about moving from the experience that we have today to seeing ourselves, in the marketing and experience areas as orchestrators of that, experience providing the ecosystem, providing all the ingredients, but letting people be the ones that create their own recipe and then decide how much influence they want the machines to have as part of that experience.

00:40:16:08 - 00:40:45:29
不明
That's really fascinating about Socrates. And I think the other risk with books and putting anything in writing is that you assign a sense of permanence to to that written word. And if there's anything we're learning right now, there's nothing permanent, let alone certain. Right now, I want to move on to the to the next question that is, or the point rather, that is this is just get practical here where you're all here to, take something away from summit.

00:40:45:34 - 00:41:17:19
不明
Hopefully the first thing you're taking away some inspiration, but then the next, phase of, of this journey involves some perspiration, which is, you know, about, put it putting it into, into, execution mode. How do you actually apply what we're learning here this week, what we're getting inspired by, into action. And, we believe that reinventing the internal operating models and talent strategies in response to AI's potential is a marketer's new imperative.

00:41:17:24 - 00:41:49:49
不明
So, Roberto, you're the resident consultant. On this on this panel, you love redesigning operating models and doing workshops, right? What's the journey you're going to take, clients down for them to, to to figure out how they can actually adopt things, give them a box of Legos. Okay. And what I mean by that is you cannot build incredible experiences until you let your team try different experiences with a technology that is now available.

00:41:49:49 - 00:42:14:56
不明
We talked about Firefly before. Regardless of the role that people at your respective teams play, when is the last time that you gave them access to a tool like Firefly and say, go and play and let's come back and have a dialog around how is that tool going to transform our experience? We are seeing all these, AI solutions and AI solutions left and right.

00:42:15:07 - 00:42:37:00
不明
A lot of them offer a lot for free. I'm not saying that you're going to take that right away and say, well, we are going to be implementing these and going rogue. But it needs to start with that intellectual curiosity, with that level of experimentation that is going to demystify what is good and what is not quite yet the perfect in the way in which these tools can be utilized.

00:42:37:04 - 00:43:00:03
不明
But you are never going to find out if you just, implement firewalls all around that you are a technology stack so no one has access to, to it. Let them play. And speaking of playing, actually, according to the World Economic Forum, 77% of firms are putting, AI training programs, in place with their companies right now.

00:43:00:03 - 00:43:22:53
不明
The only the only response that I have is, what are the other 23%, doing? You're getting your people ready fairly. Yeah. Well, we totally are. And, like, you know, I think if we look at it as something that is meant to enhance human interaction versus replace human interaction, I think that's where the sweet spot is. And, you know, I just go get my hand slapped.

00:43:22:53 - 00:43:47:00
不明
I don't see anyone from T-Mobile in here. There's another presentation coming. But when I joined T-Mobile, I was fascinated. Actually, we have an ex T-Mobile person right over there. I was fascinated at how many people it took and still takes to put a picture on the internet. It's fascinating. These teams and handoffs and like, oh my God.

00:43:47:00 - 00:44:12:00
不明
And my first job at T-Mobile, was was more in marketing automation. And that was my job. I came and I looked at the campaign from, from initiatives like briefing and our system all the way down to publishing. And like I showed you not it was like 15 teams and it was like, but it's one campaign like, and honestly, like, we don't put a lot of sexy content out there.

00:44:12:09 - 00:44:31:35
不明
We do. But like, you know, if we're selling a device like you can only sell an iPhone some so many different ways, like, you know, but the cool thing is, now that we have such a broad spectrum of offerings, right, it's not just cell phones and plans. We've got, you know, plug for Teen Life, T-Mobile Tuesdays benefits, Netflix on us and all the sexy partnerships so we can play a little bit more with content.

00:44:31:35 - 00:44:55:44
不明
But I say this all to say what I'm really looking at and what I'm excited about. And like, I was a little kid in a candy store watching all the fireflies, because I live that. I live that in real time of marketers having to, like, go in and like create a copy doc and create a brief, and they go into work front and they hand it off, and then the designer picks it up and then, you know, different channels go and brief in their agencies and it comes back and then it gets hand off after hand off after hand off of your hand off.

00:44:55:44 - 00:45:22:26
不明
And you're like. There's a AI for that. Like yeah, come on guys. So plenty of room for efficiency. Totally. Yeah. So it's marketing efficiency. It's operations efficiency. It's also even analytics. Right. Like we put all of these experiences out there, like leveraging AI to to extract your insights and, and define that next journey or that experience and start to move away from these more kind of I have a placement here and I'm going to put X amount of content in there.

00:45:22:26 - 00:45:44:10
不明
And then I have a placement there. It's like getting to more adaptive and let him I kind of adapt to that customer's journey on that next click read those intent and that signals to make sure that we're redefining the experience for them in real time. And I think that's a quotation for our customers. I think the reason why you probably have 15 teams involved in developing the content is that you there, there is an imperative to get it right.

00:45:44:15 - 00:46:13:03
不明
Yeah. We love your color scheme. By the way, what do you call a color magenta? Yeah. No, you have to you have to get it right. Certainly the color, but the whole tone of feel and the messaging and all of that, of course. But there's another aspect, I think that that I suspect is driving this, this expansion of a number of, hands and algorithms that that touch the content production process.

00:46:13:03 - 00:46:41:52
不明
And that is this notion that you want to go out with content that also is reflective of responsible use of AI. You see how I just made that transition? So viewers are going to come to you. And then we've partnered with, with Adobe on this, this idea of the content authenticity initiative and the standard setting bodies around Coupa, which I think is the best example of, responsible, adoption of AI in the creative process.

00:46:41:52 - 00:47:05:13
不明
There are other, plenty of dimensions of, other dimensions within the notion of responsible AI. But just tell us a little bit about how how Adobe is approaching things philosophically. Yeah. So like I mentioned, from the very beginning of Adobe building AI, we've taken a very trust centric, responsible, responsible centric approach. We bought a company.

00:47:05:13 - 00:47:23:35
不明
So sorry to interrupt, but I'm going to ask people also, while you're talking to, to respond to this, this question on the survey as well. So go ahead. Sorry, I think, so we bought a company, I think way back in like 2012 that became Adobe Stock. So we had access to license data for us to be able to train our model.

00:47:23:40 - 00:47:51:58
不明
And the thing we kept hearing from the market is, hey, all these products that we're playing with in terms of our generation, they're all very good. But we don't want to get sued, right? Like we're really worried about taking any of this into production. These are all fantastic for Ideating as a starting point. And the sort of promise with Firefly for us is it's a tool that takes you all the way from concept concepting and ideation all the way to production.

00:47:52:03 - 00:48:16:21
不明
Right. We want like that content supply chain. We want to be present across the board. And again, in 2019 we set up the Content Authenticity Initiative because this is basic schema schema around like fingerprinting for provenance. That is really, really important because to model the content field on any account or if it infringes on copyright issues and so on and so forth, that you want to be able to trace it back to where it came from.

00:48:16:21 - 00:48:38:20
不明
And because of the content authenticity initiative and the fingerprinting we had already done, we have greater control over the provenance of what is getting created with Firefly, which is not something a lot of other players out there are able to talk about. So this is not just about getting not sued, but it's also about if your cork and you're creating an acid with Firefly, you can be fairly confident that something that's not in your brand doesn't show up.

00:48:38:20 - 00:49:00:41
不明
And that's why Coca-Cola partners with us today. That's why we're partners with us today. Like we're all in extremely competitive markets, but we want our brand to stand out and speak for us. And we do not want another brand representation sneaking in in any shape or form. And that is the core of how we approach AI. And like I mentioned earlier, we also think about product ization in a very responsible way.

00:49:00:41 - 00:49:24:12
不明
We we do run this this concept called evaluations in the AI process, which is the equivalent of user testing in software. And every product that we put out there, we were just talking about the labs framework. We are setting up labs inside every Adobe product where we put the product out there, we get the feedback. We understand that there's a minimum level of quality bar that we're meeting before we put something in production.

00:49:24:23 - 00:49:45:45
不明
So that way we're actually being responsible, and especially as we get into the agent tech world where agents on loops and just go on for a little by little while autonomously, we want to ensure that there is a human on the loop who's reviewing and checking what's going on. It's the same like testing trust kind of philosophy that we're bringing into the agent tech world as well.

00:49:45:54 - 00:50:11:38

And you'll see this approach reflected time and again in every single feature, every single product that gets out to the neighborhood will be on it. The human stays in the loop, I like that. Well, the survey results are in, and more than half of the respondents say that transparency is in fact key. There are, well, there's a few bold Manhattans here who say they'll ask for forgiveness and maybe even apologize too.

00:50:11:38 - 00:50:36:36
不明
But, I think that all the dovetails to that, the truth being that embedding responsibly AI principles into marketing strategy, execution and governance is, in fact, a marketer's obligation. There's probably not a lot of debate around that. Okay. We're going to wrap up with with one last, item here, and then we want to open it up to the audience for some questions in the in the last few minutes that we have remaining here.

00:50:36:36 - 00:50:59:28
不明
But we have a blank page here. And that is the, the marketer's playbook. And, I think the one thing that we've all agreed to is that that we have to start now. I don't think, waiting is really an option, actually. You know, when we open it up adage that it here if someone actually strongly differs from that.

00:50:59:33 - 00:51:22:30
不明
But, my position anyway would be it's not a question of, when, because when is now the question really is what and how. So just open it up to everybody. What advice do you have for our guests here in, what first step they should do? What first word they should write on this blank page.

00:51:22:35 - 00:51:45:15
不明
A single word. Now, I think it's important. Adobe summit. Yeah. No, I honestly, I think that brands need to need to get on board. And the ones that don't are going to be left behind. Like, it changes. I'm just fascinated, even since, you know, we brought in OpenAI. Right. To to T-Mobile. And from the time that we, we got access to it, to how that's grown, it's like, it's insane.

00:51:45:19 - 00:52:10:42
不明
So I think that from a brand perspective, it's embrace I trust but verify, organize yourselves around it and really embrace it as a force multiplier, and not a replacement. It's what I would add to that, feel is the time to do it is now, but have a clear objective in mind. So this is not just about experimenting.

00:52:10:42 - 00:52:33:43
不明
For the sake of experimenting, let's do a thousand POCs that then at the end of each of them, we have no clue on what to do next. At the end of the day, link it to how are you going to be creating value? And the creation of value can be expressed in many different ways to some is gaining efficiencies, entering a new line of business, growing revenue.

00:52:33:43 - 00:52:54:07
不明
Again, the the choice is yours, but you need to have that business objective in mind. And the business objective cannot be if we are just going to run some tests, I think it's building on that. Take a holistic approach, right? This is not just a change in the technology. Your people need to be on board. Like Carly said, your processes need to be re-engineered.

00:52:54:12 - 00:53:13:46
不明
Take a holistic lens on like what value you want to derive out of all of this, and use technology as almost a forcing function to have those conversations, like the number of times I end up with in customer conversations where we're talking about Gen Studio and the conversation veers into, is the creative become going to become more data oriented?

00:53:13:48 - 00:53:31:14
不明
Is the marketer going to do more creative? These are all questions that are extremely important for us to be grappling with. We should be having these conversations, but if the technology is forcing us to have that conversation, use the moment. That's the way I think about it. And have you represent right or what are you going to write?

00:53:31:19 - 00:53:46:55
不明
Oh no, I will write a bunch of stuff. But I would say, like from the lens of like the future, like probably selfishly, the way I look at the technology is how do you as an individual learn so you can reskill because like, I think our jobs, like in terms of our roles and responsibilities will be completely different, right?

00:53:46:55 - 00:54:13:04
不明
Like every company we talk to, whether it's CPG, big tech, pharma, they're like creating AI Center of excellence, and they need AI people. That doesn't mean they need engineers. They just need people who are savvy with this technology. We've really never seen anything like this. Like you don't really see people in an organization being like, I need somebody who's going to, you know, be my, you know, my, my, search engine optimization person necessarily, like every single organization is like I'm building an AI center of excellence.

00:54:13:04 - 00:54:32:09
不明
So that's number one. So like, I'm trying to, like, teach my son. I'm like, hey, let's play around with AI because I want you to know how to use it in your everyday life. So that's one piece that's like really interesting. But the other piece as like a steward of your, you know, like basically an advocate of your, of your company is like, how do you empower your employees, right?

00:54:32:09 - 00:54:47:04
不明
Like how do you empower like Roberto was saying, like, how do you give the people who are actually learning on the cutting edge of this, like, how do you make them champions? How do you like really get them to really drive that change? Because we're not at a point where this is something that you can wait around on the sideline for.

00:54:47:04 - 00:55:06:55
不明
You actually have to do it. Otherwise you're at a competitive disadvantage. So it's really about like understanding the reskilling is actually happening in real time. Get ahead of that and then really reward the people who are actually the big champions of that. Right. Okay. Want to hear the thank you, Kev. The path forward. I want to hear from you all as well.

00:55:06:55 - 00:55:31:21
不明
Answer the last poll question. If you would. And then let's open it up. We oh time flew. Oh my goodness. It's, almost at the end, but any burning questions amongst the crowd? Yes, please. So for I think the recordings, I have to repeat it back to you basically how how did we kind of bring people along to help solve the operational issues that we saw as we were onboarding?

00:55:31:21 - 00:55:48:52
不明
I yeah, I mean, it's I think it's it's a lot of shuttle diplomacy. I think you had to bring people along early and often and show them the value and make sure that they know, like we're not trying to replace your job, but like you also don't want to spend your time digging through copy and copy and pasting and handing off.

00:55:48:52 - 00:56:25:03
不明
And we have this amazing set of tools like art and martech. Stack is Adobe. We've onboarded writer that is integrating with us to help with our service messaging. And so it's starting to get better and we have OKRs around it, like, I think establishing goals around it, around the efficiency, around the speed to market, around the reduction of the platform interfaces, and how do we kind of let marketers like the ultimate goal for me and what I kind of like is like, how can I let a marketer just through natural language query, I want to.

00:56:25:08 - 00:56:49:25
不明
You know, talk to customers about upgrades and Apple iPhone and literally let the agents run. Right. One agent's going to go get the data and eligibility. One agent is going to go create the creative one agents going to go and publishing that in the and that's not saying a marketer is has no value. It's they should be driving the long term strategy and building the brand and looking three, five, ten years ahead.

00:56:49:30 - 00:57:10:57
不明
And let, let the robots do, do the groundwork. So we're not perfect. We're still getting there. You know, we're working really closely with Adobe on, you know, the whole entire content supply chain from Edam all the way up to work front and even further beyond. And looking across there at how can we optimize. And there we're looking at all of our data structure and our data architecture.

00:57:11:02 - 00:57:27:30
不明
You know, we're really optimizing the Adobe platforms that we have, is a great one for like automated journeys, omnichannel decisioning. So, yeah, I mean, it's a lot of shuttle diplomacy, a lot of bringing people along. Yeah. I was going to come back to that. Your first phrase was the right when you close with the shuttle diplomacy.

00:57:27:30 - 00:57:46:45
不明
That's what it takes us internally. So do you mind if I just please. Yes. I was going to say I think a lot of the assistance comes from what Carly was mentioning, which is like, if I don't do this, what is my job? So starting to actually come together and defining a vision around here, here are possible things that we want more time.

00:57:46:49 - 00:58:04:28
不明
We want to be spending more effort from a human perspective, doing like especially with the creative teams. I see this a lot when we talk about Firefly and Gen studio is I used to spend a lot of time removing backgrounds and resizing, and I'm like, nobody meant to decide SQL being like, this is what I wanted to do 90% of my time, right?

00:58:04:28 - 00:58:32:16
不明
Like, what do you really want to do? Very. Where can you truly add value and move business outcomes by not doing grunt work? And like if you provide a vision for people to see what that could look like and look, they're also getting it out to Carly's point, right? I think the more we figure it out and we share our learnings and we all shape this together as an industry, I think putting that message out there is going to really, really help remove some of these like bottlenecks around I don't want to I don't want to change the way we're working right now.

00:58:32:24 - 00:59:20:35
不明
And one one quick thing that I would add, Phil, is that I would also encourage everyone to have the dialog with your teams on how you can expand the reach that marketing has to other parts of the organization. If you create that bandwidth as a result of embracing the technology, think about, a lot of the brands that we all interact with on a daily basis, where you can clearly tell that the marketing function is built only in pure marketing and maybe a little bit on the sales side of things, but then you go into the customer service areas, and marketing is not necessarily directly involved there, because is not always a revenue generating unit.

00:59:20:40 - 00:59:42:34
不明
The more bandwidth that you have, imagine creating those delightful experiences that are orchestrated by the marketing department, that you are now going to have time to be part of, I like we're, ending on a challenge like that, which is for us to just imagine, imagination. What was, what this was all about. We went down the rabbit hole together.
