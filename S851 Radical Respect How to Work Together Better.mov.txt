Hello, everybody. How's everyone doing today? Glad to be here. All right. A little energy in the afternoon. I have a question for you all. How many of you have been in a meeting in the last week where someone said or did something that was so cringe worthy, it made you want to crawl under the table? Anybody been there?

00:00:21:52 - 00:00:44:07
不明
Yeah. And then you didn't know what to say. So you didn't say anything at all. And then you woke up at three in the morning? Kind of kick in yourself. Anybody been there? Yes. All right. So what we're going to do today is we're going to talk about what to do in those moments. I started thinking about this shortly after I wrote a book called Radical Candor.

00:00:44:12 - 00:01:15:44
不明
Radical candor is very much a book about feedback, and if you write a book about feedback, I can promise you one thing you're going to get a lot of it. And indeed, I did, hands down, the most helpful feedback I got. Luckily, I believe in feedback, so I welcomed it. And the most helpful feedback I got about this book came when I was giving a radical cantered talk at a tech company in San Francisco, and the CEO of that company had been a colleague of mine for the better part of a decade.

00:01:15:58 - 00:01:36:39
不明
She's a person I like and respect enormously. And so I was really excited to talk at her company. When I finished giving the talk, she pulled me aside and she said, Kim, I'm excited to roll out Radical Candor. I think it's going to help me build the kind of culture that I want. But I got to tell you, it's much harder for me than it is for you to roll it out.

00:01:36:44 - 00:01:58:47
不明
I asked her why, and she went on to explain to me that as soon as she would give people even the most gentle, compassionate criticism, they would call her an angry black woman. And I knew this was true. It was one of those cringe moments, and I knew how unfair it was. She's one of the most cheerful, reasonable people I've ever worked with.

00:01:58:51 - 00:02:29:09
不明
And as soon as she said this to me, I had four different realizations at the same time. And the first one was that when I had been in meetings with her and this had happened to her, I was an observer and I had failed to intervene in any way, shape or form. I like to think of myself as the person who would say something, but it had never occurred to me the toll it must take on her to have to show up.

00:02:29:09 - 00:02:52:58
不明
Unfailingly cheerful and pleasant in every meeting we were ever in together. Even though she had what to be pissed off about, as we all do from time to time. But it was much harder for her to speak up in those moments than it was for me. The second thing that I realized was that she was not the only one who who experienced some disrespect from time to time.

00:02:52:59 - 00:03:20:12
不明
I also sometimes had experiences, attitudes, and behaviors, and I tended to pretend they hadn't even happened. The kind of hard for the author of a book called Radical Candor to admit that I was pretending that a whole host of disrespectful attitudes and behaviors were not happening to me, when in fact, they were. And because I was in denial, I was not choosing my battles.

00:03:20:12 - 00:03:40:26
不明
I was sort of defaulting to silence instead. I think the reason that I did that, that I sort of defaulted to silence, is that I never wanted to think of myself or of my friend as victims, but even less than wanting to think of myself as a victim. Did I ever want to think of myself as the culprit?

00:03:40:35 - 00:04:03:18
不明
So the third thing that I realized was that I was most deeply in denial about the times when I was the one who was disrespectful to my colleagues, making it harder than it needed for them, needed to be for them to get their job done. And because I was pretending that I hadn't done anything wrong, I couldn't acknowledge it or make amends.

00:04:03:23 - 00:04:27:25
不明
Now, last but not least, the fourth thing that I realized was that as a leader, I imagined that I was creating this bullshit free zone where everybody could do the best work of their life and build the best relationships of their career. But because I was pretending that these disrespectful attitudes and behaviors wouldn't possibly happen when I was in charge, I was not able to prevent them.

00:04:27:25 - 00:04:52:16
不明
I wasn't even aware of them happening. So that was a big drink of water. Now, I am a firm believer that a good two by two can solve all of life's problems, and a dictionary can help us think about how to get to that two by two. So what do I mean by respect? Respect has two very different definitions and that's confusing.

00:04:52:16 - 00:05:22:18
不明
So let's look at them. The first definition is, admiration for someone elicited by their abilities or achievements that is not what I'm talking about today. What I'm talking about is this second definition of respect, unconditional regard for the feelings right, or traditions of others. That is really what we're talking about. And what do we have to do on a team or at work in order to create that kind of respect?

00:05:22:18 - 00:06:00:32
不明
I call it radical respect because it's rare. We need to create organizations that optimize for collaboration, not coercion and that honor everyone's individuality rather than demanding conformity. And it's kind of interesting to think about what moves us in the wrong direction on one dimension or another. Because I don't know about you all, but I mean, I'm sure they're out there, but I've never met a leader who says wakes up in the morning and says, I want to create a coercive work environment today, you know, and I've also never met a single person who said, I'm dying to go work for a coercive boss today.

00:06:00:33 - 00:06:26:03
不明
You know, that's not how it works. I also think that that probably everyone in this room expects that others will respect their will, honor their individuality, and thinks of themself as a person who does the same for others. Again, I've never met anyone. I'm sure they're out there, but I've never met anyone who said what I really am longing for is a dystopic 1984 style.

00:06:26:03 - 00:06:54:28
不明
Everybody's marching in lockstep kind of work environment. So so what what happens when we go the wrong direction on one dimension or another? This is what I call brutal incompetence. And that obviously is not what we're shooting for. So given the fact that that our intention are usually pretty good that we're trying to create these radically respectful work environments, why are they so rare?

00:06:54:29 - 00:07:22:57
不明
What gets in the way? Well, a million things get in the way, but I'm going to boil it down to three unintended offenses intolerant beliefs and calculated cruelty. Now, one of the problems is that we often sort of merge these things together. We can fight these three things as though they're the same problem, and then the problem can feel monolithic and insoluble.

00:07:23:01 - 00:07:45:06
不明
But everyone in this room is a problem solver. And what do you do when you're faced with a hard problem? You break it down into its component parts and you apply the right solution to the right part. So what I want to do is offer you some really simple definitions so we can orient ourselves in these moments, which can often feel very disorienting by unintended bounded offenses.

00:07:45:07 - 00:08:14:00
不明
What I really just mean is not meaning it. This is often called unconscious bias. By intolerant beliefs. What I really mean is meaning it. This is not an unconscious belief. This is a very consciously held beliefs, usually incorporating some kind of unfair and inaccurate stereotype. And, and that gets in the way of a team's ability to work well together.

00:08:14:02 - 00:08:42:15
不明
This is often called prejudice. Last but not least, calculated cruelty. All I mean by this is being mean, often called bullying. So bias, prejudice and bullying. Let's go back to that moment that we that we talked about at the beginning where someone said or did something that was so sort of offensive or cringe worthy that you wanted to crawl on the under the table, but you didn't know what to say.

00:08:42:20 - 00:09:19:12
不明
So what can you say when you don't know what to say, which we often don't? What can you say in response to an unintended offense? I recommend here, and I response and I respond to kind of invites the other person in to understand the situation from your perspective. Great example of an AI response came from, a person I knew who went into a meeting with two colleagues, a man and a woman, and the woman on his team had the expertise that was going to win them the deal.

00:09:19:13 - 00:09:35:57
不明
So she sat in the center of the table. He sat to her left his other colleagues out to his left. When the other side came into the room, the first person came in and sat across from him. The next person came in and sat across from the guy next to him. Anybody ever noticed bias showing up in that way?

00:09:35:57 - 00:09:57:39
不明
Just like who sits next to him? And then the rest of the other side filed on down the table. Leaving the woman who had the expertise dangling by herself, she started talking, and when the other side had questions, they did not direct them at her. They directed them at him and his other colleague. It happened once, it happened twice.

00:09:57:39 - 00:10:28:03
不明
It happened the third time. And he stood up and he said, I think she and I should switch seats. That was all he had to do to totally change the dynamic in the room. Now, why did he decide to intervene in that moment? Not to be a silent bystander, but to intervene? He did it first of all, because he just wanted to win the deal, and he knew that they wouldn't win if he couldn't help the other side learn to listen to her.

00:10:28:07 - 00:10:52:33
不明
Secondly, he did it because he liked his colleague and it bothered him to see her getting ignored. So there's kind of an emotional component to this. Third of all, he did it out of compassion for the other people. He knew that they didn't intend to to to offend her, to be offensive. And he also knew that it would be easier for them to hear it from him than from her.

00:10:52:35 - 00:11:10:59
不明
It wasn't that he thought she couldn't speak up for herself, but out of compassion for the others, he decided he should say something. And last but not least, he decided to say something for himself because he didn't want to wake up. Wake up at three in the morning, kicking himself for having not said anything. So tons of good reasons to intervene.

00:11:11:03 - 00:11:32:00
不明
When you're the observer, when you notice bias sort of holds up a mirror to the other person. However, if it is prejudice, if it is an intolerant belief, holding up a mirror is not going to work because the other person's going to look and they're going to say, yeah, aren't I good looking? You know, they believe that thing.

00:11:32:05 - 00:11:58:24
不明
And so what you want to do in the face of an intolerant belief is you want to use an IT response, and IT response draws a very clear line between one person's freedom to believe whatever they want, but they cannot impose those beliefs on others. And it response can appeal to a lot, can appeal to a company policy, or it can appeal to common sense.

00:11:58:29 - 00:12:26:59
不明
I had an opportunity to use an IT response shortly after I returned to work from maternity leave. I had been out for five months. This is my second day back at work, and I was having all the conflicted feelings that a person has in such a situation. I was chit chatting with a guy before a meeting and he looked at me and he said, oh, my wife doesn't work because it's better for the children.

00:12:26:59 - 00:12:46:23
不明
Which of course was like a punch in the gut for me at that particular moment in time. But I didn't really think he meant it. I thought this was an unaffected and unintended offense. And so I tried and I response and I said, well, I decided to show up at work today because I choose to neglect my children.

00:12:46:28 - 00:13:06:56
不明
And I was expecting them to have your response. I was expecting them to laugh and apologize and we would move on. But no, that's not what happened. He doubled down and he was like, oh no, Kim, it is really bad for your children that you are back at work. So now I know that I'm not dealing with bias.

00:13:06:56 - 00:13:28:27
不明
I'm dealing with prejudice. I'm not dealing with an unintended offense. I'm dealing with an intolerant belief. And so I started with an IT response. That appealed to a company policy. And I looked at him and I said, it is an HR violation for you to tell me I'm neglecting my children by showing up at work today. And that had the desired effect.

00:13:28:28 - 00:13:52:28
不明
It kind of looked, but I didn't want to over delegate to HR. And so I decided I would try another statement that that sort of appealed more to common sense. And I said, look, it is my decision, together with my partner, how we raise our children, just as it is your decision together with your wife, how you raise your children.

00:13:52:28 - 00:14:17:31
不明
And I respect your choices, you know, and thank heavens you and I are not raising children together. We're selling double click observers so we can make this work. And he kind of laughed, but I could tell he was still not really on board. And so then I looked at him again. I tried another statement. Third crack. This one also appealing to common sense.

00:14:17:31 - 00:14:39:55
不明
And I said, look, it is my guess that you don't want to read my research any more than I want to read your research. And then he kind of laughed. He acknowledged that was true, and we moved on. I think in this moment it was it was tempting to say nothing, but if I had remained silent, it would have been really hard for me to work well with him, because I would have been resentful.

00:14:39:55 - 00:14:58:52
不明
I would have been mad. Also, it could have been risky for my career, because he might have decided that I shouldn't travel. You know, if he decided I shouldn't even drive 15 minutes for work, he definitely would think I shouldn't take, take a trip. And then I would miss out on key business so that those are. Yeah.

00:14:58:53 - 00:15:31:55
不明
I'm not saying this solved all the world's problems, but it helped us work together better. Even though we had different these different beliefs that were not really relevant to our work. Last but not least, calculated cruelty. All I mean by this is is being mean. And the best response here is a you response. If an AI response brings someone in close closer, a you response kind of pushes them away, which is what you want to do if someone's trying to be mean to you.

00:15:32:00 - 00:15:49:45
不明
I learned this from my daughter when she was in third grade. She was getting bullied on the playground and I made a mistake that I think a lot of parents make. I encourage her to use an AI statement assuming good intent of this child. I said, tell this kid I feel sad when you blah blah blah blah blah.

00:15:49:50 - 00:16:11:09
不明
My daughter banged or fist on the table. She rolled her eyes and she said, mom, they are trying to make me feel sad. Why would I tell them they succeeded? I'm like, oh, that is a really good point. So you want a new response? A you response can sound something like, you can't talk to me like that.

00:16:11:14 - 00:16:34:38
不明
Or if that feels like it might escalate the situation too much, a you response can sound something like, what's going on for you here? More like a question. You don't usually behave this way. Are you okay? Or it can just be a you non-sequitur or where did you get that shirt? The point of the non-sequitur is that you are taking an active stance.

00:16:34:49 - 00:17:04:25
不明
You're asking them to answer your questions. You're not taking whatever nonsense they just dished out. For you. So when you're in that painful moment when something has happened, whether you are the observer, whether it's happened to you, whether whether maybe you're the leader in the room, this is kind of a simple way to sort of take a deep breath, try to figure out what's happened, and try to figure out how to respond.

00:17:04:29 - 00:17:26:30
不明
What I love to do is to pause for a moment on that and invite you all to ask me anything. And then I'm going to talk about the practical, tactical things we can do as leaders, as observers, when we're the person who was disrespectful and when when we're the person who was disrespected. But let's pause for a moment.

00:17:26:35 - 00:17:39:47
不明
What do people think? All right. We got a question in the back of the room. There are mics here and here so you can walk up or you can just yell, I'm fine with that too.

00:17:39:51 - 00:18:00:14
不明
Yeah. Oh, yeah. They want you for the recording to go up to the mic. And if people want to line up, that'd be awesome. And I see a lot of hands, I'll grant you, they're not raised, but I'm not above cold. Call it. I've also spoken way too much so I wouldn't be able to yell. I think. Can you elaborate on the third you response?

00:18:00:14 - 00:18:40:14
不明
The yeah. Where'd you get that? Yeah, yeah, I just want to understand that better. Okay. So I want to give fair attribution to the idea of asking a random question. Where'd you get that? Sure. This suggestion comes from Kasha Burbank, who is a dominatrix, so she knows something about you can get advice from everywhere. And her explanation, of the she recommended, she said, like, for example, she was working with, she was working with someone who was at a conference, and somebody came up to her and said, I want to, you know, I want to come up to your room.

00:18:40:18 - 00:19:20:52
不明
And this was her, like her boss's boss. So she was now in this awkward situation. And what she she said the first thing that came into her head, which was, where'd you get that shirt? And, Kelsey explained that the reason this works, if someone's trying to be cruel, if someone's bullying you, the reason why that kind of non-sequitur or question works is that you're now kind of ignoring whatever nonsense they just dished out at you, and you're you're so you're not in a submissive role, what you don't want to be if somebody is trying to bully you is in a submissive role.

00:19:20:57 - 00:19:46:26
不明
Instead, you want to be in an active stance. You want to be the one asking the questions, not the one answering the question. So that's that's the thought I don't know, what do you think? Would it work? Maybe. Yeah, yeah, it seems kind of simple. Like where did you get that shirt? But but if you, if you, if you're worried about if you're worried about escalating a situation, that can be a good way to deflect a situation.

00:19:46:31 - 00:20:11:28
不明
All right. What are other people's thoughts? Questions? If you ask me a good enough question, you might get me to spend the next four years writing a new book. Now. All right. So let's talk about the different things that we can. Wait. There's a question. Come on up. There's Mike there. Mike there. Come to your closest Mike.

00:20:11:32 - 00:20:40:47
不明
There it is, I was there. No, Mike. There. Okay. It is more generic, so I have to deal with multicultural themes where, for example, something that comes to my mind. I work with a team in Poland, and sometimes there are two direct for me that I'm a Mexican. So how do you manage those cultural differences? Yes, because sometimes there might be misunderstandings in that communication.

00:20:40:47 - 00:21:20:49
不明
Yes. Yeah. I mean and there often are terrible misunderstandings because of cultural differences. So it's a really important, really important question. I think that good communication gets measured not at the speaker's mouth, but at the listener's ear. And so, so one of the things that I encourage people to do is to think about if you're if you're the one who said the thing and someone else is, is offended or interpreted it as bullying, even though maybe that wasn't your intention, how do you handle those situation tions?

00:21:20:54 - 00:21:43:05
不明
So if you're the one who is getting this, you're getting some difficult feedback that maybe you have bullied someone. Then what you want to do is you don't want to say, you know. Oh, I didn't mean to. It's sort of pretend instead of this kind of offense that it's something more simple, like your. You've been told that you're stepping on someone's toe.

00:21:43:10 - 00:22:22:53
不明
If you're told that you're stepping on someone's toe, you wouldn't continue to step on it and say, well, I didn't mean to. You know, you just get off the damn toe. And, and so I think, like good intentions, it's good to assume good intentions. If you're on the receiving end. But if you get if you're if you're if you're the person who caused offense, then it's not a good idea to stand up and to say, you know, assume good intentions of me that can actually be weaponized and said, try to take a few minutes to understand what it was, that that was offensive for the other person.

00:22:22:58 - 00:22:52:08
不明
And this is really hard because you didn't mean to be offensive. You didn't mean to bully anyone. Bully anyone. But but learning how to sort of accept that kind of feedback, I think it's really hard. And then if you feel like, like I grew up in the South, in the US, and at one point I took a job working for for a startup, in a, in a country that was known for being extremely direct.

00:22:52:13 - 00:23:16:19
不明
And it was hard for me at first, because I felt like I was getting bullied, but I had to learn how to interpret how, how people intended that they viewed these challenges they were issuing to me as signs of respect, whereas at first I interpreted them as, signs of of what I called obnoxious aggression. Right.

00:23:16:19 - 00:23:47:27
不明
So, so learning how to, flex for different cultures, I think is really important. Good question. Thank you. How do you feel the dynamic has changed now that we all telework more and do quick iambs and just Teller Quarles. Yes. It's a really important question. And there's the data on this are kind of interesting. Ellen Powell, how has an organization called project include?

00:23:47:27 - 00:24:14:54
不明
And she did a lot of analysis and she found that that in these virtual kinds of settings, there's more bias, prejudice and bullying, than there is in person, because I think we miss some of the context of real life and it's easier to default to stereotypes and that sort of thing. And it's easier to be cruel to someone, actually, if you're not physically with them.

00:24:15:03 - 00:24:46:08
不明
It's not. Most people in real life are much nicer than they are, online and, and, and so that's one dynamic. But another dynamic that's worth looking at is that people who are underrepresented tend to prefer a virtual work environment to an impersonal working environment. And generally, people who are underrepresented are experiencing more bias, prejudice and bullying than people who are overrepresented.

00:24:46:08 - 00:25:06:49
不明
So what is that about? The way that I interpret this is that is that it's easier to deal even though these things are happening more often, it's easier to deal with them if you're in your own space that you can control. If you can put your computer down after a meeting and scream bloody murder, you know, which is harder to do if you're if you're in person.

00:25:06:49 - 00:25:29:25
不明
So I think it's I think the the point is that we need to be more aware of these, of these things in a hybrid work environment, in a virtual work environment. And, and at the same time, we need to acknowledge that they happen in, in all of the environments.

00:25:29:30 - 00:25:55:14
不明
How would you handle a situation where, you know, you're an observer on a call and you hear kind of an escalating conflict happening. So there's some hurt feelings, and then it just starts becoming. Well, you came to the meeting 15 minutes later, and while you weren't at last week's and like you, how do you do that? So that number one, you stop it in that moment, but also so that it doesn't kind of continue to escalate.

00:25:55:14 - 00:26:18:01
不明
Call. Yeah. It depends on what this is where I find the, the, the framework sort of helpful if I think what's happening is that these two people are not aware of what's going on, that that they're starting to offend each other, but they're not even necessarily aware of what they're doing. I'll stop and I'll say I'm feeling really uncomfortable.

00:26:18:01 - 00:26:53:25
不明
Right now. I'm not saying you're hurting his feelings. I'm saying I feel uncomfortable right now. You know, can we tone it down? And, and that can help. Now, sometimes it blows up, you know, then they're like, oh, Kim, you're you're oversensitive. And, and so then I've got a different situation on my hand. I will say that I tend to default to an assumption that what's going on is an unintended offense, and I want to acknowledge that's maybe a function of my, of unfair advantages that I've had.

00:26:53:25 - 00:27:19:26
不明
That is, the other people I've experienced more bullying than I have. And so that's kind of their default, response. But, you know, if you think the person isn't is is intentionally bullying the other person, then you can say you, you cannot talk to them like that or, you know, on this team, you can use that kind of you response or what's gotten, you know, did you eat your Wheaties this morning?

00:27:19:26 - 00:27:41:39
不明
You know, that kind of thing. Does that help a little bit like, all right, all right. So let's talk about for the for the second part, let's talk about what we can do depending on our role. Because all of us have a role to play. Let's first of all talk about what in an ideal world what's heaven knows.

00:27:41:39 - 00:27:58:19
不明
This is not leaders ought to be doing to prevent these kinds of, disrespectful attitudes and behaviors from getting in the way of their team's ability to get things done.

00:27:58:24 - 00:28:23:27
不明
I think that there are three very different kinds of things that leaders need to do, depending on the problem that is manifesting. If it's an unintended offense, I recommend that leaders, teach their teams to offer quick correction. So you don't want to ignore it. An unintended offense is kind of a bad pattern. And as human beings, we are pattern makers.

00:28:23:27 - 00:28:49:42
不明
And sometimes we make good patterns and sometimes we make bad patterns. And if we want more good patterns and fewer bad patterns, what we want to do is we want to correct the bad ones quickly and in the moment. This is not public criticism. This is, you know, if your kid plays baseball and they're trying to steal second base and they're going to get called out, you yell back in the moment, you don't wait for them to get called out and talk to them after the game.

00:28:49:42 - 00:29:09:07
不明
So that's kind of what I have in mind. If what's going on is, is an intolerant belief, it's important. It's important to create a space for a conversation because it's easy for me to stand up here and say, there's a line between one person's freedom to believe whatever they want, but they can't impose their beliefs on others.

00:29:09:11 - 00:29:26:08
不明
But where that line gets drawn is going to differ from team to team. There's not an abstract way I can tell you here's here's where the line ought to be, here's where it shouldn't be. But what I can say is always important is that your team needs to have a shared understanding of what the rules of the road are.

00:29:26:13 - 00:29:53:14
不明
And last but not least, if what is going on is calculated, cruelty, it's a leader's job to create consequences. So let's kind of double click on the quick corrections that leaders can teach their teams to make in the face of these unintended offenses, so that they don't keep happening. The first thing that I recommend is that you create a shared vocabulary with your team.

00:29:53:18 - 00:30:18:52
不明
On my team, we wave a purple flag. It's a friendly purple flag. It's not a yellow flag. It's not a red flag. But as soon as somebody waves the purple flag, we know that somebody has just said or done something that is biased. But other teams I've worked with hate the idea of a purple flag. There was there was one team I worked with that would hold up a peace sign.

00:30:19:05 - 00:30:48:49
不明
There was another team I worked with that would say, ouch. Giving the person who said or did the bias thing the opportunity to say, oops, I'm sorry. There was another team that I worked with, that had kind of a cat theme going on, and they would meow at each other. So whatever it is, you know, the idea is that you want to sit down with the team and you want to make sure that everybody understands what other people's red words are.

00:30:48:49 - 00:31:10:11
不明
What is the word or phrase which, if you use it, I'm not going to hear another damn word that comes out of your mouth for the next two days. All of us have them. If you all think about it, write down what is your red word. What's the saying? If somebody says it to you, it's just going to it's it's going to it's it's going to distract you.

00:31:10:11 - 00:31:33:43
不明
It's going to make you angry in a way that is not productive. And make sure that we learn each other's red words. You don't necessarily need to be aware of every unconscious bias that might possibly happen, but you do need to be aware of how the people who you work with most closely, day in and day out, are going to respond to certain words and phrases.

00:31:33:48 - 00:32:04:10
不明
Talk to your team and figure out what is the shared vocabulary, what's the thing that they will say or do to disrupt this kind of bias when they notice it in the moment? Next, it's not enough to sort of have the shared vocabulary. You also need to do something for the people who have been disrespectful. You need to help people learn how to respond when the purple flag is waved at them.

00:32:04:15 - 00:32:28:26
不明
Because this is a moment that is deeply shameful. At least it is for me. I don't know about you all, but when someone tells me that I have said or done something that is biased, I can tell you where I feel it. In my body, it's a tingling in the backs of my knees. It's the same physical sensation that I get when my children walk too close to the edge of a precipice.

00:32:28:26 - 00:32:54:29
不明
It's a real fear response. And when I'm in that kind of fear brain, my executive function has shut down. I can promise I'm not going to respond very well. So I need to learn how to say thank you for pointing it out. And either I get it, or even more painfully, I don't get it. The second thing is really hard to say, because now I'm doubly ashamed.

00:32:54:29 - 00:33:18:35
不明
I'm ashamed because I have hurt someone. I've been biassed and I'm also ashamed because I'm ignorant. I don't even know what I did wrong. And all of us are in this situation on a regular basis, especially anybody have teenage kids, especially those of you who have teenage kids might say or do something that causes great offense and you had no idea.

00:33:18:40 - 00:33:38:32
不明
So it is it is useful on a team to take shame out of the game, to learn how to take this response and not feel so deeply ashamed. To learn how to say thank you for pointing it out. Either I get it or I don't get it. And last but not least, we've got to build a shared commitment to doing this because this is hard.

00:33:38:32 - 00:34:01:59
不明
This is profoundly uncomfortable. Hopefully it's not unsafe. Hopefully you've created an environment as a leader that makes it safe for people to do this. But just because it's safe does not mean it is comfortable. People do not want to say anything and the only way out is through. You've got to teach your team to embrace the discomfort and to build stamina, to actually do this.

00:34:01:59 - 00:34:26:53
不明
If you get to the end of a meeting and nobody has disrupted any bias of any sort, take an extra minute to say, what do we miss? Because I'm sure in every meeting, in every company, every day, somebody has said or done something biased. We all have biases. All right. What do we do about these intolerant beliefs? What do I mean by space for conversation?

00:34:26:58 - 00:35:08:05
不明
What I really mean is to sit down with your team and make sure you're all on the same page about what the laws are, wherever you are, and also what your company policies are. And maybe apply these to some situations that might have have happened elsewhere. In the book Radical Respect, I offer a couple of of examples of these sort of train wrecks that happen at companies, because somebody said something that was prejudiced or did something that was prejudiced and, and, and you want to learn how to respond, imagine, you know, how are our policies going to deal with that kind of situation, situation before you're in the situation?

00:35:08:14 - 00:35:37:49
不明
Because when you're in the heat of the moment, it feels pretty scary. Last but not least, it is so important for leaders to create consequences for bullying. And there's three different and important kinds of consequences. First of all, conversational consequences. You need to learn how to use that news statement in the moment. If you notice someone bullying someone else on your team and you're the leader, you better shut it down in the moment.

00:35:37:49 - 00:35:59:50
不明
Don't wait till later. And one of the things that leaders can do to prevent kind of an unusual form of bullying. How many people have someone that they've worked with who comes into the room and just takes up all the airtime? Anybody ever? Yeah. And so that is a problem that is kind of a form of bullying.

00:35:59:55 - 00:36:22:09
不明
And it is also very destructive to a team's ability to get things done. There's enormous research that shows when everyone on a team talks roughly the same amount of time, the team gets better results. So you can use all kinds of tools to make sure that people and get people to self-monitor. How many of you use them?

00:36:22:09 - 00:36:47:09
不明
I know, take care of some sort. You know, those note takers will tell you what percentage of time in the meeting you talked. And that data can be very revealing. So you want to make sure as a leader that you're creating these conversational consequences. You also want to make sure that you're creating compensation consequences. Whatever you do, you don't want to give high ratings or a big bonus to a bully because then it's just going to escalate.

00:36:47:14 - 00:37:18:55
不明
I worked with one company that that had three different ratings that people got one for results, one for innovation and one for teamwork. And if they got a bad rating on teamwork, that was their rating. It was not an average. Teamwork was disqualifying for any kind of, good rating or bonus. Last but not least, you want to create career consequences because there comes a moment on too many teams.

00:37:18:55 - 00:37:42:10
不明
Anybody been on one of these teams where the jerks begin to win? That is the moment when the culture begins to lose and people begin to quit. So you don't want that to happen on your team. You whatever you do, don't promote a bully. Don't let the jerks win. If this person is bullying others, you want to give them some feedback because sometimes, as we talked about, they might not be aware of it.

00:37:42:10 - 00:38:05:15
不明
There may be a cultural difference. You want to give a person the opportunity to change, but if they can't change, it's your job as the leader to take an action. And this often means firing that person, which is hands down the worst part of being a leader. And often I'll work with leaders who will say, oh, I can't imagine doing that.

00:38:05:15 - 00:38:31:14
不明
It'll leave a hole on my team. And I just have one thing to say about that. It's better to have a hole than an asshole. All right, words to live by. Everybody can go out and take a picture and remind. Remind us of that. It is better to have a hole than an asshole. That person on on a team who is bullying others.

00:38:31:14 - 00:39:05:59
不明
Even if they're getting good results for themselves, they're doing more harm than good because they're making it hard for everyone else to do their best work. And so they're creating this situation that's good for them. But that is bad for the team collectively. And it's your job as a leader to address that. So those are the things that leaders can do to prevent disrespectful attitudes and behaviors from hurting their team's ability to do its best work, to achieve great results, and to enjoy working together.

00:39:06:04 - 00:39:27:53
不明
Now, what can we do when we're the observer? Maybe we're not the leader in the room, but we notice something happening. I don't think anybody in this room woke up this morning and said, oh, I want to be a silent bystander. So what are the things that we can do to intervene in these sort of painful moments? There are five D's.

00:39:27:53 - 00:39:56:09
不明
This, this, an organization called Right to Be came up with this. I want to give credit where credit's due. There's five different ways to intervene. One way is directly sort of the way the guy did who said, I think we should switch seats, but sometimes you might be in a situation where you can't think of what to say, or you might be in a situation where you're concerned that if you stand up and say, I think we we should switch seats, you might make the situation worse.

00:39:56:14 - 00:40:19:47
不明
You don't have to intervene directly in order to be an observer who intervenes. You can also delay and by delay. What I really mean is wait until the situation, wait till the meeting is over, and then check in with the person after the meeting. I'll give you an example about why this is so important. At one point in my career, I had to give a talk and it was a big talk.

00:40:19:47 - 00:40:42:27
不明
5000 people in the audience and the leader of the team introduced my first colleague, shook his hand. Introduce my second colleague, shook his hand. Introduce me. I stuck my hand out for him to shake it, and he grabbed it and he kissed it like lead spit on the back of my hand. You know, that was gross. It was not the worst thing in the world, but also not the best thing in the world.

00:40:42:32 - 00:41:09:15
不明
But what was much worse than what happened was what didn't happen. Not a single person in the audience came up to me after and said, that was kind of weird. Do you want some hand sanitizer? You know, and then I started to question myself. I was like, am I making too big a deal of it? It's so easy to feel gaslit if you're met with silence, if nobody else seems to have noticed what what happened to you.

00:41:09:20 - 00:41:40:04
不明
And so checking in with someone afterwards can can be a wonderful way to intervene. You can also just create a distraction. Spill your coffee. That can often be an act of kindness. It gives the person who's getting bullied kind of the opportunity to regain can composure. Once I was working on this trading floor and this guy just screamed at me across like I'm a very, you know, rude way.

00:41:40:08 - 00:42:06:44
不明
And I was sort of frozen. And this other guy on the team had a squishy ball, and he just threw it at his head. That was that. Like, I was so grateful. Those kinds of distractions can make a huge difference. You can also delegate. You can delegate. That means catch someone else's eye. One of the big advantages that that observers have is that they there's more of them.

00:42:06:44 - 00:42:26:12
不明
In any situation where one person has been disrespectful to another person, there's probably eight other people in the room. It's the meeting. And if you don't feel like you're the best person to catch someone else's eye, you can delegate up, down and sideways. You can call your call button if you're on a flight. And last but not least, you can document.

00:42:26:12 - 00:42:48:15
不明
We all are carrying these movie cameras around in our pocket, and we can document what happened. Or if it's illegal to do that where you are, you can write it down. But remember, the documentation does not belong to you. It belongs to the person who has disrespected the person who is on the receiving end of the disrespectful attitude or behavior.

00:42:48:20 - 00:43:22:05
不明
All right. So those are some things that observers can do. What should observers not do. Don't default to silence. Don't default to silence. It is so tempting to say nothing because it is really awkward to do something. But in this case, it's really your responsibility to intervene in some way. All right, what to do when you're the one who said or did the disrespectful thing?

00:43:22:10 - 00:43:47:54
不明
The right thing to do here is to acknowledge what you did wrong and to make amends. But this is so hard because I am pretty sure that none of you all woke up this morning and said, I want to be disrespectful today. I think most people had this intention to be disrespectful. I'll tell you a story about a time when I was really disrespectful, and it was one of those moments where I didn't even know what I had done wrong.

00:43:47:54 - 00:44:14:22
不明
I was giving a talk and I used a phrase and someone stood up and said, that is so upsetting and burst into tears and left the room. And I had no idea what the problem was with what I had just said. And I felt terrible. And I felt stupid because I didn't know what was wrong. And what I did wrong was I just apologized and moved on.

00:44:14:35 - 00:44:41:34
不明
I used my apology to to sort of fail to acknowledge what I had done wrong. I went home and crawled in my bed into a ball and fetal position and just felt terrible. And then I said, okay, let's think about what to do, what to do next time, because it's going to happen again, unfortunately. And I decided the next time what I would do is say, not out loud, but in my head back.

00:44:41:39 - 00:45:02:50
不明
An ache has a very specific meaning. What do I mean by that? First of all, I need to realize that it's my job to be aware of the impact. Even though my intentions are so good. It's my job to be aware of the impact that my words or deeds have on other people. It's not someone. It's not the person who I just upset.

00:45:02:50 - 00:45:24:52
不明
It's not their job to educate me. It's my job to educate my own damn self. And in that moment, I could have asked when the person left, I could have said I, you know, I clearly have said something that is really problematic and I don't even know what the problem was. I would I would welcome it. I should have opened myself up to to learning in the moment.

00:45:24:57 - 00:45:44:28
不明
Then once you understand, you want to acknowledge what you did wrong, that might mean that you have to accept there might be some consequences. Maybe my speaker's fee would be reduced because I did this thing I don't know, but accept the consequences and maybe even go beyond what the consequences demand and make amends for what I did wrong.

00:45:44:42 - 00:46:12:40
不明
And only after I had done those things would my apology have any meaning. And of course, then it's got to change. I think all of us have that person in our lives who keeps making the same mistake over and over and over and apologizing, and pretty soon their apology becomes a narrative if they don't actually change. So those are some things to do if you get feedback that you were the one who was disrespectful and this is hard, this is about the hardest feedback to get.

00:46:12:42 - 00:46:36:26
不明
I mean, it's one thing to have a growth mindset about math. It's much harder to have a growth mindset about this kind of feedback, because it feels like more core to who we are as human beings, and just math skills. What should you not do if you give this kind of feedback that you are disrespectful? What you should not do is what is very human to do.

00:46:36:28 - 00:46:59:42
不明
Jennifer Fried calls it Davo. Davo means deny, attack, reverse victim and offender. This is where you say I didn't do anything wrong. I mean, poor old me. I can't believe you would say that. And then I pretend like I'm the one who's hurt like anybody. Seen that happened somewhere. Yeah, it happens all the time. Once you're aware of the acronym, it will make you.

00:46:59:47 - 00:47:29:16
不明
You can't unsee it. All right, now let's talk about what to do when. When we're the ones who was disrespectful. Is there anyone in this room who's never felt disrespected? No. We're all in this position from time to time. And, and so what do we do? I recommend to choose your battles. But that does not mean default to silence.

00:47:29:27 - 00:47:50:15
不明
It also doesn't mean default to silence what I try to do. And I would say in my career, often I made the mistake of just pretending that the thing hadn't happened and and therefore I didn't respond in any way, shape or form. And the problem with that was that over time, I began to feel I was losing a sense of agency.

00:47:50:15 - 00:48:16:45
不明
And that is not something any of us can afford to lose. And so now what I try to do when I'm in these moments where I feel like someone's been disrespectful is I try to think about what what is the return on investment of speaking up? Like in my gut, I'm aware of the risks of speaking up. But if I stop and think about what are the risks of not speaking up, then I'm choosing my battles.

00:48:16:45 - 00:48:57:40
不明
I'm not just defaulting to silence every single time. So I think this is what Audre Lorde meant when she said your silence was not will not protect you. It doesn't mean you always have to to fight, but it does mean that if you never fight, that is also going to be a problem. What I hope that you all have gotten out of this is a little bit of confidence that when you're in that moment where somebody says or does something that is so cringe worthy, even if the person is you, that you feel like you can respond to that situation with a feeling of agency and extending grace to yourself and others.

00:48:57:45 - 00:49:08:42
不明
I would love now to take more questions to get your thoughts, feedback, ideas.

00:49:08:47 - 00:49:40:31
不明
Have any advice on when to deliver immediate public intervention versus addressing privately afterwards? Yeah, yeah. So if you think that like if it's a if it's a something akin to a typo on a slide, then I think a public correction like if somebody, if, if, if I used a word that I may not be aware is offensive, it's for me.

00:49:40:31 - 00:50:05:09
不明
It's fine. And especially if you have built a, an expectation on a team that you're going to do this, if you're in a meeting with a bunch of people you've never met, and there's no expectation you may want to pull them aside later, but. But if you're working with a with a group of people day in and day out, I think it's worth it to say, let's educate each other.

00:50:05:09 - 00:50:24:42
不明
Like, let's there's an elephant in the room and these elephants grow over time, so let's get them out of the room by doing the correction in the moment. But you can start in a gentle way by saying what is everybody's read word like just by becoming more aware. There was one leader I worked with and her read word was no.

00:50:24:47 - 00:50:51:11
不明
Like, who knew that you couldn't say no? But it wasn't that she didn't want you to say no to her. She just wanted you to explain why. You know? So. So I think that is, important. I think another thing to think about is, is this a correction? That or is this, like a personal criticism of the, of the individual?

00:50:51:11 - 00:51:14:00
不明
And if it's a personal criticism, then that's a conversation you want to have in private. Like if I'm going to tell my son that he is always trying to steal second when he shouldn't, like, I'm not going to yell that in the game. But I'll tell him that after. But if he's running, you know, in the moment, I'll just say back.

00:51:14:05 - 00:51:43:48
不明
I think the other thing about the shared vocabulary that is useful is that it's quick, if you can reduce the the public correction to a word that everybody understands, then it is then it disrupts the bias without disrupting the whole meeting. Does that make sense? Yes. All right. Hi. Hi, there. This is great. Thank you so much for putting together.

00:51:43:53 - 00:52:08:21
不明
I am a manager of four project managers, and we all know, as project managers, we're supposed to be the influencers on the project team, so what would your feedback be for a project manager? To encourage the project team to talk to themselves when they've had cringe moments, and not always bring things back to the project manager to solve the problem?

00:52:08:25 - 00:52:39:33
不明
Yeah. Yes, yes. Because the project, the project manager will burn out pretty quickly if it's always so. I think that one of the things that that that I have tried to do when I'm in that situation is to sit down with the team and to encourage the team, to, to to realize that it is that they're going to be better off in the long run if they talk directly to each other.

00:52:39:37 - 00:53:03:14
不明
So it's so tempting when one person comes and talks to you badly about another person to feel like you're being the empathetic leader to listen. But this is the one time when I think that all you're doing when you listen is you're stirring the political pot, you know, because you're going to talk to this person, and then that person is going to see you talking and this person and think, gosh, is he talking about me?

00:53:03:14 - 00:53:31:15
不明
And then and then vice versa. And pretty soon, every time you're talking to one of the people, the other person you know is is on guard. So ask the people. This is what I call sort of clean escalation or preventing backstabbing. Ask the people when they have feedback of this sort to to talk to each other, but reassure them if they can't work it out, they can come to you together.

00:53:31:19 - 00:53:54:46
不明
But you're going to be more like a marriage counselor. You're not a shuttle diplomat in that kind of situation. The other thing that I try to do in those situations is to make myself the, the, you know, the example of the person who makes a mistake. So I'll go into a team meeting and I'll say, look, for example, a CEO actually, that I worked with did this.

00:53:54:51 - 00:54:16:59
不明
He tended to refer to he would get up on a stage like this and he would say, guys, you guys. And a woman on the team said to him, you know, I'm not a guy. And so he said he was going to try to start using you all instead of you guys, which didn't. He was from Michigan. That did not fall trippingly off his tongue.

00:54:17:04 - 00:54:50:58
不明
And, he bought everyone little those Nerf rockets on a rubber band. And every time you said you guys people were allowed to shoot the nerf, you know? So he made it sort of fun. He made it lighthearted. I think these things can get very heavy, very quickly. And so doing something to try to, like, say, okay, I want you all to point it out when I do this and let's do this for each other, because none of us want to say things that are biased, and yet we're all saying these things like, you want to try to take shame out of the game.

00:54:51:03 - 00:55:27:44

Hi. Hi there. For somebody on a team who is that version of, like, complicated as a whole? I have a two part question. Is one how long or what amount of time is the right amount of time with which to expect somebody to be able to change some of these more difficult behaviors? Yeah. And then piggybacking off of that, how do you measure and or coach it if that person is telling you that I'm trying, I'm doing all of the things.

00:55:27:49 - 00:55:54:09
不明
But the feedback you're hearing may be says it's not landing. Yeah, yeah, yeah it is. It's really it's really hard. I think when I've been in that situation, the first thing I try to do is to imagine all the different reasons why the person might be behaving this way. There was one person in my life who had a reputation as as a complicated A-hole.

00:55:54:13 - 00:56:20:42
不明
But he was not actually a complicated A-hole. But he he had ADHD, and he he really didn't realize the impact that he was having on others. And, and at first I was, like, criticizing him and criticizing him and criticizing him, and he he seemed to be brushing me off. He did not seem to be listening to what I was saying.

00:56:20:47 - 00:56:50:51
不明
And finally, one day, I don't know what I said or how I said it, but he clutched his head. He rocked back and forth and he said it was very upset. And he said, this is a disaster. My wife has been telling me this for years. All her friends think I hate them. I don't hate them. And I realized that that he was really the reason he was brushing off was that he was really upset by this, and that he was afraid he couldn't fix it.

00:56:50:56 - 00:57:11:32
不明
And I didn't experience him the way that others experienced him. So I said, look, I think I've been kind of a jerk to you for the last couple of months. I've been telling you, every time you get it wrong, sometimes you get it right. So I'm going to focus on the times when you get it right and let's see if we can understand what's going on.

00:57:11:37 - 00:57:32:56
不明
And, and he really did change his behavior. And so I think the more in that situation, what it was really important for me to do was to, like, quit labeling him and to try to focus on behaviors like, can't in the meeting, you know, when you did this and had this result, let's figure out what to do next.

00:57:33:01 - 00:58:11:14
不明
And then the shift it from the negative to the positive that that helped. I mean, I, I, I have kind of maybe a weakness for obnoxious aggression sometimes I find it kind of funny. So, but but but I think that that has been an asset, to, to dealing with it sometimes. But there are other times when, when I have noticed someone being a jerk and then I respond to it by becoming a jerk myself, like there was one time when somebody was an incredible bully to someone on my team who came into my office really upset.

00:58:11:19 - 00:58:33:30
不明
And, I mean, I called this guy and I really ran to him. I became the jerk. And like five years later, my husband wound up working with him. And the guy was like, you're married to Kim Scott. You know? And so don't make that oops, don't don't make that mistake either. Like, don't allow someone else's obnoxious behavior to encourage.

00:58:33:35 - 00:58:54:25
不明
And it can be tempting to do that because you're standing up to the boy. I think the more you can, can, think about this as developmental feedback, the better. But sometimes someone is actually not behaving in good faith and they're trying to be a jerk. And, well, that's the thing is that you almost become the person enabling the bully.

00:58:54:30 - 00:59:17:28
不明
And so yeah. So then you got a fine line to walk with. Yeah, understanding and feedback. But then what you're hearing elsewhere, yeah, it should be work to work with these people, but not too much work. It's too much work. It's better to have a hole than an asshole. Thank you. Thank you. All right, we've got time for one more quick question.

00:59:17:33 - 00:59:36:10
不明
Anybody? Any other last thoughts? All right. I want to thank you all so much. I want to encourage you all to take the survey. Take the survey. Thank you.

00:59:36:15 - 00:59:36:52
不明
For.
