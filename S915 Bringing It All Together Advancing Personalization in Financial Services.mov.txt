00:00:00:07 - 00:00:20:43
不明
So good afternoon everybody. My name is Christopher Young. I'm the senior director of global industry strategy. Today's session is bringing it all together. How to advance personalization in financial services. Just by show of hands. By the way, how many of you. I do a session like this once a year? How many of you been to one of my sessions?

00:00:20:48 - 00:00:38:25
不明
See, I'd like to take credit for this crowd, but if, like, 40% of you have never, you know, you're the only ones who've seen me before, so I can't. So it's just pure luck that you're all here. So thank you. Here's another question for you. Find it. You know, here at summit 12,000 summit attendees, where do you think financial services ranks in?

00:00:38:25 - 00:01:03:49
不明
Like the top attending segments? Or industries that attend? Who said to you? That's correct. I mean, and that's again, that takes the drama out of like, all right, that's it. I'm not doing this anymore. Everybody enjoy your time now. But yeah. Two. And I think this is a testament when we think about the speakers that we have today, like this is the testament to a global community that we've developed over the years in financial services.

00:01:03:54 - 00:01:26:17
不明
And one of the things I like to concentrate on is just bringing in a lot of different speakers to give their own lived experience in terms of how they have done this in a regulated industry that is as complex and matrixed and intensely regulated as possible. So our our panel today consists of Bonnie Thorne from AMP, as well as Daniel Lane from Truist.

00:01:26:22 - 00:01:36:15
不明
And we'll talk more about like, you know, the what their sessions, what they're going to cover. But let me just jump right in. Let me give you a perspective.

00:01:36:19 - 00:01:56:20
不明
The enterprise is under pressure. And I realize this might be a little too dramatic. So sorry about that. Way too dramatic. The end in a world where so the enterprise is under pressure. Show of hands. Do you feel like you're under pressure? Show of hands. Yeah. Okay, a good chunk and some of you are not being true to yourself.

00:01:56:20 - 00:02:16:55
不明
You you know, it's a safe. These are these are like 300 of your closest friends. Yes. We're all under pressure. Okay. Safe space here. So, I mean, when you think about some of the things that you are tasked to do, you know, in terms of getting efficiency out of your platforms, tech modernization, reduction in operation costs, we've got to reach new segments.

00:02:16:55 - 00:02:38:55
不明
We've got to get younger customers. We've got to grow our market share. These are the things that you are all dealing with. And they generally fall into two categories the increasing of revenue growth. How do we grow, and then how do we become a more efficient operation? And this is what our survey data tells us as well.

00:02:38:56 - 00:03:03:42
不明
So 85% of financial services firms have identified growth as a strategic priority. But customer experience is as that means of unlocking that growth. And in that process of improving customer experiences, 91% think that increasing operational efficiency in that process is equally as important. These are two sides of the same coin. These are two sides of the same coin that we believe.

00:03:03:46 - 00:03:27:25
不明
So when you when you see all the presentations and think about the applications and the innovations, think about it in two ways. One, how does it change the end customer experience, whether it be for you or a business or an employer or another institution, and then what it means for you and your teams and how they operate. New ways of working faster, better ways of operating.

00:03:27:25 - 00:04:02:10
不明
Think about that in these two terms. Lastly, let's refocus ourselves with more dramatic slides. Let's refocus ourselves. At the heart of digital transformation in this industry has to be the customer, and that every innovation that you see or think about, in this conference, every advancement has to directly tie to improving or enhancing the personalization of that journey and in that process to not just deepen engagement, but what's so important in our industry, which is trust.

00:04:02:15 - 00:04:20:40
不明
Okay, so let me pivot. Have you all a show of hands, have heard of the Digital Trends report, digital trends report thing. You know, thank you. We do that every year. And if you didn't we feel bad about that too. But the Digital Trends report and I actually bypassed the second slide. So before we get into the Digital Trends report Chris you're doing a tremendous job already.

00:04:20:40 - 00:04:40:37
不明
It's 4:00 in the afternoon. Okay. But even before we get into the Digital Trends report, that concept of advancing, you know, the, you know, the customer journey, deepening engagement and trust, these are the priorities that we see that the financial services industry is trying to accomplish. And they're very much aligned. So good for all of you. But let's think about this personalization.

00:04:40:37 - 00:05:03:59
不明
But not just, you know, offers, but the products and services that you deliver to a consumer or business. Seamless integration. This is actually thinking less about your journeys, but the journey of the individual and how you embed yourself in that process, where the financial need is, where the financial is need is needed, need is needed. Okay, I messed that one up to product interconnectivity.

00:05:04:06 - 00:05:25:40
不明
You have to solve for the totality of someone's financial challenges, and that gets into connecting things like loans and investments and deposits and even insurance enhance user experience. What that means is like, we look, there's a lot of complexity and paperwork and, you know, maybe some of the interfaces aren't as friendly. How can we make that better? And frictionless financial wellness.

00:05:25:40 - 00:05:42:36
不明
This is at the center of it, isn't it? How do we improve the financial health and well-being of our customers? And all of these things have to be done with the highest degree of security to maintain that level of trust. So this is how we're thinking about the priorities of the industry. Has anybody heard of the Digital Trends report?

00:05:42:41 - 00:06:13:57
不明
I'm kidding. Now let's get into it okay. So I get to ask a few questions. And I ask this question every year. And one of them is simply the top organizational goals of the industry. And every year, thankfully, I get the same answer, which is again, offer meaningful digital interactions that improve financial health and well-being. Because if your customers are interacting with you more digitally, then like the higher order recommendation engines and guidance and advice that you can provide cannot be analog, it can't be in person only.

00:06:14:02 - 00:06:37:28
不明
So again, smarter decisions with their money. It has to happen through digital interactions. And you see the usual cast of characters here, right. Modernizing experiences to get younger, accelerating time to market, selling more to compete with digital entrants and then deflecting or reducing cost and interactions. But I assure you, if your North Star is that 47%, these things will come, these things will come.

00:06:37:28 - 00:06:58:55
不明
They'll stick to their channels of choices. They'll engage more digitally, you'll sell more, you'll, you know, you'll attract younger audiences and you'll get faster in terms of your speed to market. In delivering that for this individual. How many of you. So look, that was the top response by the industry. But I also wanted to look at the differences, between the various industries that make up financial services.

00:06:58:55 - 00:07:20:53
不明
So show of hands. How many of you work for a bank? Okay. So yeah, it's the same. And if you think about and what I'm looking at is where the averages were the biggest differences, where they stood out. So the average 47% banks was at 50. So again, if you think about what you are trying to accomplish from taking day to day transactional relationships and make them far more meaningful, this makes total sense.

00:07:20:58 - 00:07:44:15
不明
And you offer a wide breadth of of products and services. How many of you are in the wealth management space or asset management space? Okay, well, I think the focus here was 39% average before 45% for this industry is yes. You're looking at a looming transition of wealth. You're looking at the next generation of investors that are looking to invest completely differently and getting into four different types of asset classes.

00:07:44:15 - 00:08:07:51
不明
So how do we modernize and get younger and make sure that wealth is maintained within our firms? How many of you are in the insurance space insurance industry. Right. This is like a pretty good mix. This is pretty good. So yeah, I think the times insurance can be transactional moment in time needed. And yes, we how do we compete with digital entrants that are selling more directly to consumers in many cases.

00:08:07:51 - 00:08:35:02
不明
So these are the differences between the three. Let's get into the difference. So as part of this Digital Trends report, there were about 658 financial services responders but also 1300 consumers. And what you're looking at is the blue line is what they expect in terms of importance. And then the black line is what they actually believe their brand delivers.

00:08:35:02 - 00:09:00:20
不明
So the top areas 90% were, you know, obviously handling my data responsibly okay. The other top was that 79% is the consistent experience between digital interactions and physical locations. So how do I really connect my interactions with that advisor in my mobile app, my interactions, you know, online and with the bank and where they were the lowest in terms of the gap.

00:09:00:25 - 00:09:31:07
不明
The difference was transparency when using AI. And I'll give all of you a mulligan for that because this is totally new. But obviously, like this is a new thing. We have to start setting expectations and be more transparent in terms of what we're doing. But the second was the anticipation of needs. So again, when we think about all of these things, the transparency of using data, the connecting of physical and digital, the anticipation of needs, we have to think about like, okay, what does this mean for how we're organized, our capabilities?

00:09:31:12 - 00:09:51:16
不明
What does this mean for what data do we have to bring in, and how quickly can we use it to get from responding to anticipatory? So these are the things that we need to think about in the over the next few days at this conference, I asked this question also like, okay, where do you think like the priorities in terms of reshaping the customer experience?

00:09:51:21 - 00:10:11:15
不明
When I asked this question two years ago, I wasn't even on the list, wasn't even in the top five last year. It was one. This year it's fallen second to enhancing self-service and I'll get back to that one in a second. But these are the things these are the core things that I would expect. Innovation with AI, the data activation for personalization purposes.

00:10:11:15 - 00:10:30:42
不明
And going back to that anticipation in terms of like where we can do better to meet those expectations. And then the agile organization evolution, this is something that we have to talk about quite a bit, right? Because it's not just a technology problem, it's a people and a process issue. When bringing in this new technology of how to use it effectively.

00:10:30:46 - 00:10:50:08
不明
But this one bothers me a lot. The enhancing self-service. How many of you believe your top priority is enhancing self-service? Okay, good. Let's throw this survey out and make sense then. No hands off. Because it's not like this is the thing that bothers me of like, okay, when we think about some of the things that we have to do with our own personal finances, sometimes they're too complicated.

00:10:50:13 - 00:11:15:18
不明
Sometimes it's really boring. And a lot of the time for press for time. So when we think about like a genetic I and I and anticipating needs and doing like, why not do more things for them as an example, with the right levels of permission? If I see some folks from Vanguard here, if I have another application and my beneficiaries aren't added, is there a way to say, hey, we noticed that your beneficiaries aren't the same in these two accounts?

00:11:15:18 - 00:11:27:42
不明
Here's a way to quickly add them. Like these things simplify the lives of others versus just allowing them completely to do all of these things that they may not want to do themselves.

00:11:27:46 - 00:11:49:37
不明
So there are a series of questions we had around generative AI, and I am contractually obligated to talk about it. In my session. But let me just simplify some of this. So what are the motivating forces? What I mean by that okay, so where is the pressure in, adopting generative AI? Well, two clear places. One to increase the flow of content and meet the demand for personalization.

00:11:49:42 - 00:12:11:06
不明
And the second is to increase engagement of the activities that we're doing. Where do they think they're going to get the most? These survey responders are going to get the biggest measurable impact over the next 12 to 24 months. That is the tailoring of interactions through that higher volume of content and the quality of those interactions through a higher degree of personalization.

00:12:11:11 - 00:12:36:58
不明
Where do they think they're going to get revenue for 2025? One is the personalization of recommendations. Yes. The more tailored I can get, the more adoption I would get. And the second goes back to that other question that we had previously around meeting consumer expectations around connecting channels. Yes, to help seamlessly help our customers interact. And that is through that content creation that gets extended to multiple channels and through that consistency.

00:12:37:03 - 00:13:05:58
不明
So these were kind of like the big picture with I. How many of you find it easy to get I type things approved show of hands with? No. So sorry I didn't see that one coming. Okay, so how do you what are ways that these survey folks, had the ability to get a generative AI approved? And I assure you that there are many customers in this room that are currently POC seeing, piloting, and actively using our capabilities.

00:13:05:58 - 00:13:28:44
不明
So there is a way, there is a way, and a lot of it has to do with education. But the first thing you would say is okay, they mitigated concerns around data quality and compliance. Risk. So they addressed risk as one. Then they looked at things like, you know, training AI teams, aligning their usage, evaluating tools. Do I show of hands how many of you have AI committees groups.

00:13:28:44 - 00:13:59:33
不明
Yes. So that's a huge sign of maturity, in my opinion, that you have a cross-functional committee that's looking at what tools we should use and for what purpose, and that gets into governance and standards. So I've mitigated risk. I've got some sense of what we're going to do in a standardized way for my enterprise. And then we get into like demonstrating that this these things can be done and they can provide value, defining clear business objectives of what we're going to do with this other than like massively iterate different types of content.

00:13:59:38 - 00:14:16:39
不明
And then the establishment of metrics and a means of tracking success. So this is proving the value of what you're doing. And at least 84% of the responders chose one of these.

00:14:16:44 - 00:14:39:38
不明
So let's level set to where we are today. And let's transition to our are our great, customer speakers. This is where we are today. You know, there is data in different places. You're dealing with all sorts of different disparate technologies, different business units. It's a highly complex and matrixed organization that you work with. Decisions are are made in various places.

00:14:39:43 - 00:15:05:57
不明
And what I found is like the stories that I hear from our customers again, because it is not a technology challenge alone. It is bringing these departments together. It's bringing this data together. It's bringing it all together. For the name of this session is what's going to allow you to advance your digital and personalization initiatives. Think about it in these terms.

00:15:06:01 - 00:15:20:12
不明
So with that, let's bring in our first customer speaker Bonnie Thorn from AMP. Warm summit round of applause for her.

00:15:20:16 - 00:15:45:36
不明
Thank you everyone. It's great to be here. All the way from Australia. And and let me tell you a little bit about HP. So HP limited, we're one of Australia's leading, financial services. It's been around for 125 years, which will give you some context about the complexity of our business. We are, banking, superannuation and retirement solution organization.

00:15:45:41 - 00:16:00:02
不明
And I'll talk a little bit about superannuation a bit later as one of my use cases. And we have 1.3 million customers, and a lot of money in the funds under management.

00:16:00:07 - 00:16:26:26
不明
So let me tell you that a bit about our starting point. So when we embarked on our digital transformation, there were some key problems that kept us from achieving our desired customer experience. And essentially when you do digital transformation, that's what you're trying to get to, you know, a fantastic digital experience. So the inability to connect offline and online data to deliver omnichannel experience, and what that meant was we were driving a whole heap of traffic to the website.

00:16:26:31 - 00:16:47:37
不明
But we didn't actually do any personalization. Like we didn't actually know what that was. Therefore, you can do funnel management. You can do send people down, down, product pages, getting to application, getting the application. But you'd actually didn't know whether or not they were prospects or existing customers. Then we also had about a six email automation systems.

00:16:47:42 - 00:17:14:58
不明
So we had a fragmented marketing technology stack, which meant that we couldn't actually deliver a unified customer experience. And we had data in different places and data using different email platforms. So we couldn't unify that all into one customer engagement strategy. We had expensive, disconnected decisioning platforms and we couldn't use it ourselves, so we had to, we had consultants help us.

00:17:15:03 - 00:17:33:41
不明
We also had, technology help us build them, which meant that we couldn't scale and we couldn't get that speed to market that we wanted. And we always needed assistance. Which leads us to the fourth point, which is our desire to be self-sufficient. We wanted to run our own campaigns. We wanted to to be the owners of our campaigns.

00:17:33:41 - 00:17:51:47
不明
We wanted to be the drivers of our own destiny. And then we've got real time reporting across the journey. So it doesn't matter whether it's real time reporting or real time in general. Real time, it's important. So for us, we were trying to make sure that we had this real time activity reporting to actually help us with some of our decisioning and activities.

00:17:51:52 - 00:18:14:04
不明
So what that meant was in our app, we have something called Next interactions. So invoices. So when you display, like an offer or a notification in there what. And make sure if a customer accepts it or dismisses it that they didn't actually see that offer or the same offer again and not be annoyed by it, but they actually say to say something that was an interaction.

00:18:14:04 - 00:18:32:36
不明
But if you have a delay in that and if you're and if you imagine you've got online banking apps, you open the app, you dismiss, you dismiss the the notification, and then you're still in the app. But it's in less than 30s you take a look at your bank balance and then you come out of your app. You don't want to see the same thing over and over again.

00:18:32:36 - 00:18:40:32
不明
So that real time was actually really quite important for us.

00:18:40:37 - 00:19:01:19
不明
So why now? These problems are probably not unique to us today. MP it's probably what most organizations have as an issue. So it's not unique to us. It's just there was a time and there was a time that was actually ready for us to actually embark on a digital transformation. So for MP, growth is a key focus area.

00:19:01:19 - 00:19:17:33
不明
And two years ago we launched our new brand platform, which was called Whatever Wealth You Want. And by bringing it to life, you can imagine in the customer journey, you see these great ads on TV and you go to our website to the old it's the old website, the old branding and into our app and all that digital experience.

00:19:17:33 - 00:19:42:52
不明
So we'd had a really fragmented digital experience, and it didn't coordinate from an experience lens that we were looking for. We also looked at our organization 175 years, meaning lots of legacy platforms, letters, a lot of tech debt. And so we were looking at how do we simplify our technology across the organization, but also how do we have just one single platform and one stack to help us do all of our marketing?

00:19:42:57 - 00:20:05:51
不明
And that's how we consolidated six email platforms to one. And earlier this year we launched our new digital bank. So with our for AMP Bank, we launched new new propositions and small medium business banking and we also looked at a new app as well. So today we've got my pay app which is for old banking products and superannuation and a new banking app for a new proposition.

00:20:05:56 - 00:20:44:30
不明
So we started to take a look at how we actually start to piece all that together and start to integrate. The way of looking at how we're a direct to consumer focus area. So traditionally AMP is a B2B organization. So we've got brokers, we've got advisors. And that's why we've got a wealth platform as well. So traditionally being a more of a B2B organization, we had a desire to actually go directly out to customers to grow that direct to consumer base and then finally to be able to compete successfully, especially if you can hit direct to consumer, you're going to be able to compete with your peers and your competitors in place.

00:20:44:34 - 00:21:03:34
不明
So that means that we wanted to start to take a look at what does that look for us in terms of the customer experience we wanted to deliver across our entire customer journey, understanding all those different customer journeys and those customer touchpoints, all those different channels and how we bring that to life through.

00:21:03:39 - 00:21:23:33
不明
So this is what our three year plan looked like. Pretty simple. There's probably a lot more complexity to it. Our first year back in 2023, we put a business case together and actually at the time was probably the fourth time we put the business plan together over that period of time with when we actually got it over the line.

00:21:23:38 - 00:21:42:18
不明
And I would say that one of the key areas of our success, and being able to get that business case over the line was how we partnered with technology with that. So you can't run marketing technology with just marketing team. You actually really need to partner to have technology marketing help you deliver that. So they supported us through the business case.

00:21:42:23 - 00:22:07:07
不明
They supported us through the whole implementation process, which enabled us to be able to deliver successfully. So then last year, we spent our time implementing the stack, and we made a decision to, decommission platforms and also implement it. And so we looked at apps. So the customer data platform, also agile email platform and decisioning and also CJA, which is the analytics platform.

00:22:07:12 - 00:22:35:58
不明
We also decided to build a new website last year as well, which took us to that 12 months and we we always had an end target. But you can start to see how we start to piece all that together with how we were going to launch into personalization at scale. And then this year, now that we've you can probably get the idea dismays really fast, you know, new digital banking, total amounts, marketing technology implementation ten months, new website.

00:22:36:03 - 00:22:58:32
不明
Previously the year before, new new new brand platform. And essentially this year is the exciting year where you actually start to use all this technology to start to actually build personalization campaigns. You start to embed the tech, and we start to take a look at what that looks like for us in the future.

00:22:58:37 - 00:23:23:30
不明
So talking about implementation last year without making it seem so simple because it was complex, we had we we took a very pragmatic approach with how we were going to do it. So we looked at use cases. What does marketing do today and what are the type of campaigns that they were doing. And then we started to look at what data did they need to actually be in the in the platform first?

00:23:23:34 - 00:23:45:09
不明
So we took the print bed page 275 years. We did not take 175 years of data and put it into the platform. We worked out what data that we needed and bits put it in. So it's fresh, was clean. And we put those governance, those rules together so that we weren't going to have those complications of having just put any data in there, because the data part is actually quite important.

00:23:45:14 - 00:24:08:10
不明
And so first up, in five months, we put in our online data, which came from our website. So behavioral behavioral analytics, and then we also took a look at our app data as well. And then we also looked at what type of B2C of the consumer data, for banking and superannuation. And then also what B2B data that we wanted to actually also incorporate.

00:24:08:15 - 00:24:34:39
不明
So we took a pragmatic approach. We got it out in five months. And then we started a slow release thereafter. So we're taking a look at implementing agile implementation, the implementation channels, SMS channels, our app, we also looked at things like, decisioning. And we also included invoices on expense interactions into the call center.

00:24:34:44 - 00:25:18:04
不明
So our CDP ego was actually helping us provide channels of office decisions into all those different channels for our existing customers. And we finished the project in ten months, including decommission the 69 platforms. So what does that look like today? So today we are the owners of our destiny. So we're able to build journey the journeys two and a half times faster, and we're able to send out emails eight times faster because we're actually able to build and do that ourselves, which means that we have got great results from our overall click through rate, and also the amount of journeys that we're actually able to build.

00:25:18:09 - 00:25:38:10
不明
And by doing that, sometimes what happens is that all that use case and all that data that we had put in originally, it means that marketers end up going, I want to be able to do more. And so we needed to be able to scale and try and move faster for them. So as much as we can do this today, we've got to find a way to scale and automate.

00:25:38:15 - 00:25:44:39
不明
And building journeys allows you to do that.

00:25:44:43 - 00:26:14:26
不明
So I was talking about superannuation before and some of you guys might know what superannuation is. But back in Australia we have something called superannuation which is everyone, every employee. So if you start a job at 14 and nine months at McDonald's, you actually open a superannuation account. So what it is, is your employer will give you your base salary as well as today it's 11.5% into a super fund.

00:26:14:31 - 00:26:38:15
不明
So it's for your retirement. So it's like a retirement pension fund. So everyone in Australia has that. It's mandated by the government. So full superannuation. And you can choose which super fund you choose. So you start a job. So you earn 100 grand a year and you take home 100 grand match tax. And then the employer will also put in an 11.5% into a super fund.

00:26:38:20 - 00:27:00:27
不明
And so that's ANP. So banking and super and wealth platform. So here is one of the campaigns that we built as a proof of concept that it was just timely because we ended up launching this into consumer and launching into two markets. So it was called get Super Close to Super. And it's the first half of this of this diagram, nothing new.

00:27:00:32 - 00:27:18:18
不明
I'm sure all of you guys do it. You send a campaign or you send you sort of a launch above the line, you go above the line, you get TV out of home, etc. that that's not unusual. And then you also have campaigns going to existing customers and you're segmenting them and then you're also going to non-customers doing digital acquisition and digital performance.

00:27:18:18 - 00:27:38:01
不明
So that first half of it nothing new. But when you actually start to incorporate personalization and when you start to actually invest in your marketing technology, stack allows you to do the second half, which is that personalization stuff part where you actually start to capture data from all these different sources into you, into your CDP, and you can make decisions around what's your next best interaction, you next best offer.

00:27:38:06 - 00:27:55:19
不明
You can work out if they're a prospect and they've turned into a customer, and then you can actually stop marketing to them. So you actually save money on your media dollars, and then you can actually create more journeys. That allows them to have specialized, personalized journeys for each one of those segments. So you can build as many as you like.

00:27:55:24 - 00:28:15:09
不明
But that's what enabled us to be able to get a lift of about 18% of our baseline with our revenue. So this campaign was really great. Example of helping us make use cases of why the investment in marketing technology was a win for us.

00:28:15:14 - 00:28:43:23
不明
So looking ahead and I'm making it sound really, really good. But it's not without some challenges. It is hard. And we continue to define our processes. We talked about people, process and technology. We continue to do that. Because something about this stack, you've got to realize is that when you have a platform that's on, that's a CDP, CGA and a heart, you need to work out how they all work together.

00:28:43:28 - 00:29:01:55
不明
Because when you get expertise and talent, they are either algo specialist or AP and really you need people to actually understand how it all works so that when you have the right quality of data in there, you're also getting the right real time reports and you also being able to send real time campaigns and automation out as well.

00:29:02:00 - 00:29:18:16
不明
So we continue to refine our processes. We're also investing in our people training. That takes a bit of time, but you've got to invest in your people. So we constantly re baselining what that maturity curve is. So in working with Adobe we're working at beginner intermediate. Where do we want to get to. How do we train our people?

00:29:18:16 - 00:29:38:06
不明
How do we get them certified. And also how do we scale faster. Because now that we're we're rolling out, we're finding like businesses and other and marketers really want to use this, and they want us to move faster and we seem to have a bottleneck. But, you know, we want to try and move faster and try and enable this more.

00:29:38:11 - 00:29:54:29
不明
So some of the key focus areas for to for this year, for us, I mentioned we took a pragmatic approach with data. So we're taking a look at how we get more data in and what types of data and trying to forecast before marketing assets for these particular campaigns. What kind of data can we get in there?

00:29:54:34 - 00:30:18:49
不明
And then also, as you know, CDP allows you to also, connect and bring in external data sources. So digital media publishers, etc., you want to be able to try and bring that in eventually down the track as well. As I mentioned, we're defining and embedding our people process and technology and something to consider as well is single point dependencies with these platforms.

00:30:18:54 - 00:30:52:18
不明
Talent is a bit of a shortage, which means that every time you skill someone up in your team, they're going to get poached by one of your competitors. So you want to try and get more people, learning about your platform rather than just a team that looks after you, team that looks like at KGaA, you want to be able to allow lots of users, like you want to give access to marketers, to take a look at KGaA and take a look at building their own reports, or take a look at the dashboard, and not having just single teams that where you create bottlenecks.

00:30:52:22 - 00:31:15:41
不明
Severely sick leave you with three key things or three key learnings. Through the implementation phase, that helped us move so fast. Besides, taking the problematic approach of data is one of the best advice I got when I started was get your data ready before you start. And what that means is you understand what your app is, but you also understand what data you need to bring in the use cases.

00:31:15:55 - 00:31:36:12
不明
But you don't take everything. With we've got a lot of, data sources, lots of policy admin systems. And so we're not looking at trying to integrate all of that. We're taking a look at what we need and then transform it before it goes in there. So we took a different approach for data. And and that's likely why we were able to get that up and running in five months.

00:31:36:12 - 00:32:02:56
不明
First. Choosing the right implementation partner also ensures your success. So when you're when you're launching a new platform or it's unlikely you will have these, subject matter experts in your organization already. So having a really good implementation partner that's going to help you coach and guide you took the cyber talk, the technology, etc., architecture help guide through that period of time watching.

00:32:02:56 - 00:32:24:07
不明
They help enable it. It's faster as well, but it helps you get through the bottlenecks. And then lastly, we had a change manager through this project. And they were instrumental to the whole project being able to help us, communicate to the right stakeholders, organize training for us and trying to really embed that change in the organization instead of doing it afterwards.

00:32:24:14 - 00:32:41:42
不明
So we're able to move through all of that over that ten months time and into the end of the year. And as we're learning more of how we were doing things, they were actually helping us along the way and actually creating those opportunities for, for change and making people comfortable with the change that was going to happen.

00:32:41:46 - 00:32:51:45
不明
And that's it. Awesome. Okay.

00:32:51:50 - 00:33:07:45
不明
Bonnie. Thank you. Thank you so much for that. That was great. So another warm summit round of applause for Lena Truist. Welcome to the stage. Sorry. Some of the left.

00:33:07:49 - 00:33:39:29
不明
All right, well, I'm very happy to be here with you today. To share our story of how we've been advancing personalization at Truist. So I'll first start off by sharing a little bit about Truist. We are a purpose driven financial services company, and our purpose is specifically to inspire and build better lives and communities. We believe that through a focus on care, we'll be able to meet client needs, be able to help empower our teammates and ultimately lift up our communities.

00:33:39:34 - 00:34:25:34
不明
We are headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. Our footprint spans 17 states, including DC, and we serve 15 million customers today. So now to introduce myself, my name is Xenia Lane and my background spans operations, analytics, marketing specifically and product management focused on the Adobe products to try and bring them to life within our organization over time. I have led various analytics organizations and have had a special focus on omnichannel engagement, which really was, I think, able to shape how we were thinking about our data strategy, working with our technology teams to try and bring these capabilities to life within our channels.

00:34:25:39 - 00:34:55:27
不明
So just to give you some context around the products that I worked very closely with, there's going to be a CDP, new CJA, decision Management, which we use to present personalized messages and channels, and then the integration of some of these capabilities into our channels. We have them integrated into our digital space today, as well as in our branches and contact center through integration into our, proprietary CRM system.

00:34:55:31 - 00:35:28:30
不明
So our start began with the merger of BBA and SunTrust. And so we brought two organizations that were very similar culturally and tried to establish a organization that was deeply rooted in our purpose. And for us, as we were bringing these organizations together, we actually recognized that there was an opportunity for us to establish technology that would allow us to support an enterprise personalization strategy, again, to deliver care to our clients.

00:35:28:35 - 00:35:41:10
不明
So in modernizing our tech stack, our goal was to shift our client engagement from campaigns to conversations.

00:35:41:15 - 00:36:07:21
不明
So for us, personalization and digital transformation matters because it really is no longer a competitive advantage. Our clients are expecting it as we think about how we live our daily lives, automation and some of the convenience that we are seeing in in everyday tools, you know, everyday channels, we understand that that's shaping how our clients want to interact.

00:36:07:26 - 00:36:37:59
不明
Additionally, it's recognition of the fact that as a bank, we have access to rich data. Of course, we want to use that in a way that's responsible, that is in keeping with our regulatory requirements. But even so, being able to use that data to help provide enhanced guidance, recommendations that really care for the client's financial well-being. And so the other side of that, too, is that there are efficiencies to be gained as a result of enabling these capabilities.

00:36:38:04 - 00:37:04:21
不明
If we think about, being data informed, right, in terms of how we engage with our clients and establishing their own experiences that are always on, so they are aligned to moments that matter for the client and when the client is experiencing that moment, whether it be today, tomorrow, there will be an experience in place for them to help care for navigating them through those moments.

00:37:04:21 - 00:37:26:42
不明
And that really is where the efficiencies lie, because it's no longer a campaign that's one and done. You invest time in actually setting up the experience and then that's available to you, really in perpetuity. Of course, you want to monitor it and enhance it as you go, but it does give you a good framework to be able to establish how you're going to be engaging with your clients.

00:37:26:47 - 00:37:51:00
不明
So to turn this vision into reality, there were three key areas that as an organization, we focused on that included platform modernization, how we were approaching our use cases and the prioritization of those use cases, and even how we were aligning our operating model to the capabilities that were being delivered.

00:37:51:05 - 00:38:12:29
不明
So I'll start first with the modernizing platforms. To begin with, I think that there are just, you know, common challenges that we faced. It was understanding what data was going to be important for the experiences that we were building and how much data. So Bonnie had mentioned, you don't want to bring everything in. You want to be very selective in what you're bringing in.

00:38:12:34 - 00:38:37:13
不明
We also wanted to think about the channels where we were activating and how we were going to be activating within those channels. So both of those from our experience was a phased approach, especially around the data, because for us, we had the added challenge of bringing two organizations together. And so we were settling on either the system or a central system to remain.

00:38:37:13 - 00:39:02:40
不明
And Truist, at Truist. And so we were bringing in populations of clients that maybe didn't have any history in that particular platform. And so we had to be very focused on what are the MVP requirements to allow time for those clients to actually build history within those platforms. And then for us to be able to rebuild our analytics and our insights?

00:39:02:45 - 00:39:41:31
不明
So that we would be able to leverage for personalization. So when we first started, it was a very MVP view of the CDP, understanding the types of products that they had, the services that they had, for example, whether or not they belong to certain, line of business segments, all of that to be able to then personalize at a MVP level, but then knowing that we would grow into the data and we have grown into the data largely use case driven, we want to make sure that when we have a request for data, we understand the experience that's going to support and then how we could potentially leverage that data in multiple ways, not

00:39:41:31 - 00:40:17:03
不明
just for a specific journey, that really thinking about overall personalization, how we're sharing audiences, for example, for on site personalization, all of that kind of factors in to how we're evaluating the data. Additionally, from a channels perspective, we started first with digital, and for us, it made sense because we wanted to ensure that in a channel where we don't have that high touch with our teammates, we want to be able to personalize those messages and at least spur the conversation to be able to either bring them back for exploration or even take them to a branch.

00:40:17:07 - 00:40:56:03
不明
And, the timing of it was actually very good, too, because we were building a new Truist Digital platform. So we had the opportunity to build this experience in parallel with the activities that were required for mobile banking teams online banking teams, to integrate the technology into their build. So another consideration we had, as well as we were thinking about the phased approach, was the fact that we did have some prior capabilities and we had to make the decision, do we build something that is fresh new start, or do we build something that is modeled after capabilities we had previously?

00:40:56:07 - 00:41:21:45
不明
And for us, because we had very tight timelines, we were bringing together these two organizations. We needed to be ready to serve our client for our client. Day one activities. We chose to use, the framework of a previous capability to help us build. Now, there are some drawbacks to that. Would have been great to think of. It's, you know, start fresh and new and maybe build something in a different way.

00:41:21:50 - 00:41:45:10
不明
However, we didn't have time for that exploration, so we ended up borrowing what we had before. But even so, we still evaluate the experience and look for opportunities to optimize. And even if retrospect, we're trying to look for efficiencies, it is something that we keep in mind as we're moving forward and then which new platform features to activate and when.

00:41:45:10 - 00:42:09:03
不明
So this is something that we iteratively consider as new features are being released within the Adobe platform, we evaluate our readiness for that. What channel will that feature working? What are some of the use cases we can support? And because we do work in an agile way, especially with our technology partners, all of this really is in partnership with our technology teams.

00:42:09:18 - 00:42:19:00
不明
We also want to make sure that we are timing that work to be able to coincide with their capacity and availability.

00:42:19:04 - 00:42:39:43
不明
All right. So then the second category I had mentioned that was a focus area for for us was the use cases. And this is especially important because we were using our use cases to help prove out the value of the platform. So I'm not going to lie, there is always some level of resistance when you're bringing in new technology.

00:42:39:43 - 00:43:02:52
不明
People that aren't comfortable with it, they don't want to give up their old ways of working. For us, it was specifically talking about how do we move from campaigns. The conversations are, lines of business are very comfortable with having email blasts that go out to be able to get responses. And we were asking them to shift. We were going to be intelligence based in terms of our targeting.

00:43:02:52 - 00:43:23:31
不明
So very laser focus, which means that you narrow down your populations. And then there's concern that we're not going to get the appropriate clicks or excepts of those messages. So we had to really change our focus and say it's about the value to the client. And we were using these use cases to prove out value to the client.

00:43:23:33 - 00:43:49:06
不明
Number one, that was very client centric. Number two, that we would monitor and ensure that we were getting similar performance, if not better. So we did use our use cases to be able to demonstrate that. The other thing is with the use cases is it will start to highlight where you have conflicting priorities, because for us, we didn't build an organization that was already aligned to the new ways of working.

00:43:49:15 - 00:44:11:42
不明
We were borrowing from resources that were supporting both campaigns as well as the personalized experiences. So as we were going through this, we needed to be able to say, these are use cases that are going to help with the personalization, putting the client first. But that requires then that you have to have at least one executor of leader that really says this is the way that we're going to be moving.

00:44:11:42 - 00:44:36:27
不明
And so allow for that capacity, allow for that prioritization to occur. Another challenge that we had was there's difficulty in quantifying those benefits. When you first launch with these capabilities, you may not have the maturity to be able to to identify the full end, to end, impact of your personalization use cases. So for us, what we did was we started with MVP KPIs.

00:44:36:27 - 00:45:04:52
不明
What is it that we could measure in the short term? As we were building out the new reporting required collecting new data to help provide that end to end view. And we we really did it with just identifying wells or something that we can do in the short term. How many clicks are we getting? How many clients are we touching through this experience and then allowing the teams to be able to build out the reporting that was required to really provide a more comprehensive view?

00:45:04:57 - 00:45:27:16
不明
Finally, balancing short term versus long term gains, we used our use cases to help get the support that we needed within the organization. And that was a trade off. We had to pick less complex use cases to be able to show those quick wins. And so, at the very beginning, we tried to look for what's viable within the system.

00:45:27:21 - 00:45:37:01
不明
How can we start to prioritize and build it and then show the value through the early monitoring?

00:45:37:06 - 00:46:06:06
不明
Okay. So that third area that I said was really important for us from a focus perspective, had to do with our operating models and really rethinking how we were approaching these personal, personalized use cases for us, again, product centric to customer centric engagement required us to be more data informed in terms of what are the behaviors that are important for us to identify, to be able to proactively engage the client.

00:46:06:10 - 00:46:28:13
不明
There was also recognition that our traditional workflows are not aligned to our agile ways of working. We were launching these experiences with the support of our technology partners who operate in agile. The business does not always operate in agile. So while we have to identify the capacity, plan it out and understand which iterations this work is going to be picked up.

00:46:28:28 - 00:47:01:01
不明
Our business was not always aligned in that way, and so it really would create some concerns and maybe missed timing for, capacity on both sides. And that's something that we have to work through. We still are working through, although we've started to address it, through some other organizational items, which I'll cover in a second. But these POC use cases did allow us to prove out, number one, test out the ways of working.

00:47:01:01 - 00:47:26:46
不明
Who were the teammates that were required to support these activities? How much capacity was required of their time. Right. And so we were able to then come up with a framework, a playbook for how we would be going to market with this, with these use cases that then helped inform our overall structure and then finally slow experimentation and iteration.

00:47:26:51 - 00:47:58:50
不明
This is probably the biggest challenge is because there are risk guidelines, concerns around how we're using the data. We really had to partner with our risk teams to really understand and make sure that we were, in keeping with our regulatory requirements. But what we were trying to do was, can we share those results? Can we share the lessons learned and celebrate the wins very early to help influence how we are going to be organizing our our areas?

00:47:58:55 - 00:48:03:16
不明
So.

00:48:03:21 - 00:48:30:03
不明
So our progression of use cases and how we were operating to advance personalization started first with the PLC use case. And now in this case we were looking at a journey that was based off of signals clients visiting or like pages, for example, showing an interest. And this is where we started our first attempt at this personalization experience had a big kick off, brought in the appropriate teams to be able to have these conversations and say, what's the support?

00:48:30:03 - 00:49:07:49
不明
What's the support required to be able to build these campaigns? And at that time, running through this campaign, this effort, we actually saw a 13% or 13 x lift in the click rates associated with these messages compared to a similar campaign. And for us, what this demonstrates was really number one, efficiency, because we were moving from a couple million of clients who were being emailed, and then the response rates were very similar with the journey, with only, I would even say 100,000 clients who were receiving an email.

00:49:07:49 - 00:49:27:29
不明
So there was efficiency in terms of who we were targeting, which reduced risk for us in terms of less opportunity for people to opt out of our messaging as well as, message fatigue. And so that was the start when we were able to demonstrate that this is where our CMO was like, this is definitely the way that we need to move.

00:49:27:34 - 00:49:57:16
不明
And he was really supportive of being able to invest further in our learnings and the capacity that was being given to these use cases. Fast forward to another year or so of activity, where we started to expand the signals life events that were occurring, building experiences through journeys to be able to message clients through email, but also when they walked into the branch, or if they logged into online banking or mobile banking, they had similar messaging.

00:49:57:16 - 00:50:26:33
不明
So we were coordinating those messages. And what that allowed us to do was actually practice the routines of what's required to be able to support a personalization use case or a personalized experience. And during that time, we were able to reduce by 40% the delivery of those use cases. So again, it was able to give us a repeatable playbook that allowed us to be more efficient in the actual build of those experiences.

00:50:26:38 - 00:50:55:15
不明
And then now what we've done is we've taken these learnings and apply them to how we are organizing our operations today. We have dedicated cross-functional teams, so we still are bringing together, multiple areas, but they are dedicating time and capacity to these use cases. And they are, we're basically applying agile like routines to the business. So it's not just within the technology side.

00:50:55:15 - 00:51:27:33
不明
We're also bringing it to the business so that we're able to move faster. And we have now, through the help of the broader organization, because now we have our marketing leaders who are involved with the strategy and the experiences they're creating prioritize backlog for these use cases that are then going to be the roadmap for the data that we're bringing into the CDP to help support, on the longer term, as well as identifying how much and where do we need resources to support these efforts.

00:51:27:37 - 00:51:48:47
不明
And so I would just say that, and then the other focus is who these teams are also focusing on identifying foundational reporting. What are the KPIs that are needed really maturing that, practice of measurement so that we're able to apply to, to future use cases. And so that's in progress. I'd love to be able to share next year.

00:51:48:52 - 00:52:23:00
不明
How we do on that end. So for us just to talk about the personalization framework, it really starts with the data ensuring that you have the right data to be able to personalize in the moment. Again, it's not all of the data. It's the key data that's going to be activated in real time when they're walking into the branch, when they're calling into the call center, or even logging into their into their digital banking connected channels is also important for us because we want a comprehensive experience.

00:52:23:00 - 00:52:49:40
不明
So no matter what channel the client is engaging in, we want the messaging to be relevant. If they respond in one way, in one channel, we want to remove the message in another so that again, we're increasing the relevancy and then we're focusing on personalized content, ensuring that we have a good inventory of content to support these expanded conversations that we're building from a design, experience or from a client experience perspective.

00:52:49:55 - 00:53:22:17
不明
We're also thinking about the long term design. What are those moments that are occurring within our client's lives that we want to ensure that we have some engagement to help support them, and then insight development as our analytics teams continue to explore existing data and new data sources, and that being able to identify those insights, bringing them into the CDP so that we're able to activate in real time, helps further the, the acceleration of our use cases and then finally measuring, learning and iterating.

We want to make sure that we have a good foundation for how we're going to be measuring this, the success of these programs. So we're working very closely with our analytics partners to ensure that we've got a robust framework for reporting within the platform and even outside of the platform, to be able to really identify the full end to end impact.

Okay, so our lessons learned. Technology is not the leader people are. And what you will find is you can bring in all the technology you want. If the people are not supportive of it, you're not going to get the adoption and you're not going to get the value. Proof of concept for transformation. We really focused on identifying some use cases, knowing that we didn't have all the answers.

00:54:11:13 - 00:54:33:18

It's almost like a dress rehearsal. You want to go through the process, see what works and what doesn't. You want to test, learn and then adapt your approach based off of what you're seeing through your proof of concept. Use cases, and you want to measure what matters, ensuring that you have KPIs in place to be able to monitor and measure the success and ultimately drive the support.

00:54:33:23 - 00:55:08:33

And then an early engagement with partners to avoid roadblocks, especially in a regulated industry. You want to ensure that your risk partners are writing along, that they are understanding the capabilities, right, because a lot of this is new to them. We have to educate them and bring them along. And then as they get educated, they may see where there's going to be some roadblocks thrown up even by other partners of, say, privacy teams, etc. but they start to understand the value and are able to present where we need to have controls in place and why we need to move forward with those capabilities.

00:55:08:38 - 00:55:16:32

Despite that, the fact that there are risks. But again, there's always some types of control that we can put in place.

00:55:16:37 - 00:55:36:38
不明
So a departing thought I would just say is don't underestimate the power of trust and shared purpose. It's very important to ensure that when you're going through a transformational journey like this, that you have support at all levels of the organization. It can't just be top down and it can't be bottom up. It needs to be at every level.

People are committed to these new ways of working and are going to be there to help you achieve this success. So yeah, awesome. Thank you. That was great.

Kelly Jackson, thank you. Thank you. Thanks a lot. All right. Sounded like, they're bringing it all together. So let me wrap this up with a few closing thoughts. As we kind of come to the conclusion of day one. So what are some of the key takeaways from the presentations you heard today? One is remember we saw from the digital Trends report about having the customer at the center focusing on their financial well-being.

00:56:18:28 - 00:56:37:59

The things that we do will help them make smarter decisions with their money. The second is you hear this a lot, but you kind of get a sense of how important this is, especially if we think about how we're going to evolve into a genetic AI. That data foundation is super important. And also getting to that anticipatory ability, again, data is at the center of that.

00:56:38:04 - 00:57:03:16

I really what Zanna said before around bringing the organization together. How do you do that? Right. Coercion? Probably not. But like having like a you could try but not all right. But creating a shared purpose, that is extremely important. And then building that kind of culture and that movement towards personalization and digital. And then Bonnie mentioned something that was really interesting to me, because the challenges that our customers have are associated with change management.

00:57:03:21 - 00:57:27:59
不明
Why not have people that are focused on that, like dedicated change managers that shepherd this process? I mean, only a few years ago I heard of roles of like martech enablement, roles like, hey, my responsibility is to train and get people to use this stuff. This is just another evolution of that. So with that, I want to, make sure to, if you the last year there was people had trouble finding the survey, so I made them change.

00:57:27:59 - 00:57:48:01

The slide is like, this is where the survey is. So please, if you like the session or you didn't either way, give us the feedback. That's super important. And I wanted to again, thank you all for attending this session. Thank you to the speakers. Those were really great presentations and I really appreciated the energy in this room late, at 4:00 in Vegas.

00:57:48:01 - 00:57:51:32

And, thank you again and enjoy the rest of summit. Take care.
