00:00:00:07 - 00:00:26:57
不明
We are in the plan. Reach. Measure, repeat how Adobe transforms customer acquisition session. I hope you're all in the right spot, especially after we all got the text of sorted out. So I am Kiyoshi Hara. I run product for a mixed modeler. We're going to do more of an introduction on myself, Zoe, Will and Sean, who are panelists in a little bit, but I thought it might make the most sense to just define what customer acquisition means, at least for this session.

00:00:27:02 - 00:00:31:37
不明
Right. So we can get all on the same page.

00:00:31:42 - 00:00:56:44
不明
This is a lot of text. Okay. Put simply, at the most basic level, customer acquisition. It's all about finding more customers for your brand. Right. That's what we're looking to do here. Taking a click down. Right. You probably heard this over the last couple of sessions or definitely over the last 24 hours, right. Is taking the unknown population that is just out there and trying to make them know near barren and bright and vice versa.

00:00:56:49 - 00:01:24:47
不明
Okay? Meaning we as marketers, we as customer acquisition marketers, performance marketers, we go out there and use a means of many different channels, right? Digital paid search, display, CTV affiliates, retail folks, right? Comparison shopping engines, travel folks, travel aggregators all the different ways that you speak to customers, potential customers and of course, offline. Right. All the old stuff radio, TV, direct mail that's still going on.

00:01:24:52 - 00:01:45:16
不明
Any different ways that you can to communicate with your potential audience. Right? To drive acquisition. But let's be real here. It's not just it's not just an introduction. We're hoping in these customers transact, right? They become customers. Then. So I know we've been calling a customer acquisition right in this session in Adobe. But oftentimes I just hear you all say growth, right.

00:01:45:17 - 00:02:07:37
不明
Drive customer acquisition in order to get growth. And that's what this session is going to be all about. Yep. So a little bit more introduction on me. Again my name is Kiyoshi. I, I come from an acquisition background. Before I moved over to the tech side, I ran a portion of Discover Card. Jack was acquisition business specifically on digital for a paid search and display and onsite optimization.

00:02:07:42 - 00:02:28:17
不明
And then an Amazon where I worked in the video game space. Right. That was a fun one, trying to get folks to become customers, right? A various video game publishers like Microsoft, in order for you to get them to get more games, more, more playing time and. Then I moved over to tech, right? Building technology to frankly help acquire customers.

00:02:28:29 - 00:02:50:07
不明
Right. For brands, partners, agencies. What was common across all of these experiences was there was always a ton of numbers, tons of equations, lots of math. Right. And there was always some sort of curve. How efficient are we? How are we going to drive more growth? The other common point was the arrows were always up into the right.

00:02:50:07 - 00:03:09:31
不明
Now I'm joking. Like, they better have been up into the right. Right. And frankly, if we're honest with ourselves, they weren't always open to the right, especially for acquisition, right? Acquisitions. And that's we're going to talk about today. But as you'll see over the next couple of slides, when I get into the stats way, I kind of want to keep this in mind.

00:03:09:35 - 00:03:32:13
不明
There's all different kinds of quotes, right, that we've seen in the past. Numbers never lie, right? Numbers never lie. They're simply telling different stories depending on the math of the tellers. I love this, especially as an acquisition marketer. Hey, my numbers were down. Yeah, but look at this over here. That was up. Or hey, the numbers were down.

00:03:32:13 - 00:04:01:30
不明
It wasn't my fault. Okay? Even this stat, this quote, it's it's not a stat yet. It's not from a mathematician. It's not from an analyst. It's not from a data scientist. It's actually from an author, a poet. Right. Which is actually perfect. So we're going to get into some of this today. Right. Taking a look at these metrics, taking a look at how they apply to customer acquisition, our panelists are going to come on and talk about how they drive customer acquisition and growth right for their their companies.

00:04:01:35 - 00:04:22:15
不明
But I'm going to say three letters that maybe most of you are going to be fearful of. Let's do a quick QBR of where we actually stand, right. As a team of customer acquisition folks, performance marketers. And let's take hopefully a more honest look right at some of the metrics that we see out there. And first, I'm going to think, you know, Gartner for allowing us to use their metrics right, in order to tell this story.

00:04:22:22 - 00:04:55:43
不明
Right? I know I just beat up telling stories on metrics, but I'm going to do the same thing right here. Right. So let's take a look at this first one. How are things going now? How are things going now? How do we all feel. Right. And this survey from Gartner is actually looking at marketing leaders. And what marketing leaders said was that the majority of survey respondents, right, were dissatisfied with campaign performance and on average, almost 90% right lifted the 87 to 92 was a better story, reported that they experienced issues with campaign performance in the last year.

00:04:55:47 - 00:05:21:13
不明
Okay, so campaign performance campaigns driving growth, not going that great. Okay. Let's keep going with the story. Almost three quarters. I did it again 73.75. That's close enough said that they're being asked to do more with less. I'm sure that's resonating with a lot of you. All right. I see it every day with the clients. Right. Let's budget less resources, less people.

00:05:21:18 - 00:05:38:44
不明
That's not a great combination. Performance isn't going that great and do more or less with less stuff. Not not a good not a good equation right there. Right now. Let's see what we all did about that though. That combination of stats.

00:05:38:49 - 00:06:01:53
不明
We did more with less up until the right. 40% of 44% of total campaign marketing budget was spent on campaigns. It's the 31 increase in year over year. So yay for us. We did more with less. We made more campaigns. We're going to go acquire more customers. But the story didn't stop there. And either that a number. So bear with me.

00:06:01:53 - 00:06:25:39
不明
I got a couple more numerical slides to get through. All right. We're going to do this again. I'm taking even more liberty with the numbers. I'm I say almost three quarters of us again with that, 70% had moderate or significant challenges in measuring ROI. So we did more with less, but we don't really know if it was worth it, that that's an issue.

00:06:25:44 - 00:06:50:38
不明
Right? My sincere hope is this is difficult, that an impossible that we all in this room had some sort of way to measure success. And we got there eventually. Right. But let's keep going with the story. One more step from these marketing leaders, okay, that's too far off to say three quarters. I got, say, 60%, 60% said that they had moderate or significant challenges.

00:06:50:43 - 00:07:19:35
不明
Aligning campaign strategy with business objectives. The last stat was bad. This one's kind of damning, right? We don't really know what happened, but 60% of us guys saying we don't know why we did what we did, that, that is problematic, right? But up until the right the whole market's not down. But it is it on accident that we're succeeding that that that is an issue.

00:07:19:40 - 00:07:39:16
不明
So let's drill in a little bit more right. What are we doing. We've done more with less. We don't know why we're doing we're doing and we don't know if it was worth it. Okay. So on that dire note, we're going to get going a little bit more. And like, I know we're all seasoned marketers here, but I just want to come back to basics for a second.

00:07:39:16 - 00:07:54:58
不明
Again, I mentioned I was going to define customer acquisition. We're going to define just these basics real quick. But put simply to acquire customers you need to do these three things. You need a plan. You need to reach. You need to measure right plan. How and why are we doing this? What's your plan? What's your strategy to go acquire customers?

00:07:55:02 - 00:08:15:02
不明
What's your budget? How are we going to go invest reach? Who are we talking to? Who do we think potential customers are? How do we find them? Is there anybody else that looks like them? How can we grow this population and do we need help finding them? And then measure what worked? I don't mean after the fact, right?

00:08:15:07 - 00:08:30:09
不明
When you're planning and you're coming in with your strategy, we all need to figure out how are we actually going to measure success or and we're going to be honest or failure, maybe something in between. Right. But let's all get on the same page about how we're going to measure the efficacy of what we're doing.

00:08:30:14 - 00:08:47:00
不明
So we're going to drill down now. Now I'm going to fulfill this promise. Like this is the last set of numbers on slide okay. When you click into each of these plan reach a measure right. There's further surveys out there about how we and our teams all feel about these these three words okay. And there's some to some hopeful numbers in here.

00:08:47:00 - 00:09:17:33
不明
61% think that there's better ways to actually plan to get to better efficacy of, of investment, right, to drive growth. Through marketing mix modeling. Right. So there's like confidence there in that 61% reach 62%, 62% say that they're planning to transact directly with their networks, their partners. Right. In order to reach the right audiences, to, to drive growth right through those needs and the measurement not necessarily positive, but it's kind of interesting, right?

00:09:17:38 - 00:09:43:13
不明
66% they're saying that they have challenges showing the impact of these campaigns to their stakeholders, right. Communicating what was actually done. So a bit of a mixed bag, but there is some hope out there. Right. So when we look at this we're not done on those three. Right. Those are the basics. Now we get into that level tool on course at least my college went one and 1 to 2.

00:09:43:13 - 00:10:05:03
不明
All right. So now we're adding one more level of complexity. Do everything that we just talked about. But do it again and again and again. Nudge that performance right. Optimized right. That's the word that we talk about okay. Doing a better job with planning or each measuring. But now do it over and over again so that you're not just launching the ship, you're steering the ship or whatever overused right metaphor we want to use.

00:10:05:08 - 00:10:25:51
不明
We want to make sure that just because we're acquiring customers are hitting some sort of target or piece, right? Whether it's over, under what we expect to, we want to keep improving, right? Optimize that. Right. Don't just set it and forget it. Be able to adjust. I'm preaching to the choir here, but this is this is super hard right, to do this well do this right and repeat it consistently right.

00:10:25:51 - 00:10:48:20
不明
Repetition and consistency. It's super hard to do this right is no small task. And there's existing processes, technologies, organizational structures that do all of this today. Right. You got to get the campaign brief. Someone's got to write that campaign brief. Come up with the strategy after they've reached on. Right. You got to figure out how are you going to allocate budget against that brief right to hit your goals.

00:10:48:25 - 00:11:07:19
不明
That's the planning stuff that I was talking about. How are you going to reach audiences? Who who are you going to reach? Is there enough of them out there to hit your your targets? Then you get into you right creative development, right, making sure that you're having the right message out there, placing those messages in the right places and in front of the right audiences.

00:11:07:24 - 00:11:29:19
不明
And then you've got activation, right, executing against this entirety of the plan, making sure you're buying in the right places and hopefully with the investment right, buying for the right amount. Right. And then measurement. Right measurement. Ideally, the collection of all data happens. Right. We get to that optimization step and you get this wheel of measurement. So you see actually how things are going with the underlying data.

00:11:29:23 - 00:11:38:53
不明
And I got to put AI and ML in here. Every presentation has got to have it right. We've got AI and ML hopefully helping with all of this.

00:11:38:58 - 00:11:54:17
不明
So Zoe's going to show you a demo, at least from an Adobe stand. Right. What we think I could be needed to help in some of these. So she's going to show you what this actually looks like in product instead of just watch a slide where okay. And really, you know, you can kind of see almost like our conversion funnels.

00:11:54:17 - 00:12:16:07
不明
I'm kind of whittling things down. I'm going to whittle it down further to two. Okay. What we're addressing Adobe is really focusing these things in the two key areas, right, to drive impactful change and add value to all this process. And first is strategic collaboration. And what we mean by that is specifically strategic collaboration amongst some of your partners through collaboration that just got announced.

00:12:16:11 - 00:12:40:03
不明
And that allows you to connect directly with publishers, leverage critical first party data, scale that into right your publisher partners in a, first party data, right in a privacy safe way to quickly find potential customers and forecast the reach right hits that that reach element that we've been talking about. And then second unified incrementality, measurement and planning, right, with mixed modeler and CJA.

00:12:40:08 - 00:12:59:29
不明
Right. This is meant to remove the pain point of having disjointed analysis, right? And overreliance on antiquated ways to measure where the last thing that the customer C02 interacts with gets all the credit. Right. We want to move away from that. So the true incremental impact of all of your your team's efforts, right. And driving acquisition.

00:12:59:34 - 00:13:15:30
不明
So bringing these things together right. We want to have an honest look. Right. Like I know I've been cherry picking a couple of stats, but we're not saying we're going to recreate the wheel, right. Instead, we're going to give better tires and navigate the bumps and twists and turns that keep throwing at you. Right. And we're going to go through.

00:13:15:30 - 00:13:25:39
不明
Right. That kind of bits and pieces that can make sense for you all. As we progress through the demo and the, and the, fireside chat.

00:13:25:44 - 00:13:45:50
不明
Well, we've got to build my bet. All right. Now, I just mentioned a bunch of tech. Right. So we're at Adobe. We build a ton of tech, but kind of taking my Adobe back off and putting my old marketer hat back on, like, let's be real here. Like, tech isn't enough, right? It's tech and people. And we're gonna talk about how Adobe marketing specifically has addressed both of these.

00:13:45:50 - 00:14:05:41
不明
And as an example, in next couple of slides. Right. But both are needed effectively and efficiently acquire customers, especially at scale. Right. You need you need your teams, your organizational structure, your processes, even the like I said, the definition of success to be in place so that the tech can enable all these folks right to have as much success as possible.

00:14:05:41 - 00:14:30:37
不明
And those teams need to have their autonomy and, excuse me, autonomy. And, and structure, right, to use those tools to acquire those customers in the best way possible. So looking at this, we're gonna take a look at a real example, what we did at Adobe Marketing and kind of show their evolution over time. And how they got to acquiring customers as they do today.

00:14:30:42 - 00:14:54:55
不明
Right. So Adobe, we've been around for decades. Right? Photoshop is a thing. It's a solution. It's a verb. At this point. But, you know, acquiring new customers is not as straightforward as it used to be. Right? So even Adobe Marketing, right. We took an introspective approach and started analyzing, analyzing how our processes, our technology, right, where they fit for the need of the day to acquire the customers and the growth that Adobe expected to have.

00:14:55:06 - 00:15:17:15
不明
Right. And again, if we distill this down, what they found was kind of two main challenges, right, with kind of the specifics that ladder up to it. But the two main challenges were, number one, there is a huge focus on the price tag of creating experiences, right? Prices, efficiency, kind of driving things based off of cost, right over the needs of the people who you're creating them for are potential customers.

00:15:17:20 - 00:15:37:21
不明
Right? So that was actually number one. Issue number two was across your enterprise, right? We had inconsistencies, inconsistencies in our approach and how we invested in our marketing and execution. Right. And that was actually a huge one that some of these specifics will that are up to you. Right. Our channel execution teams, that's the first one operated independently of one another in a fragmented approach.

00:15:37:26 - 00:16:00:26
不明
Right. Those channel teams I'm going to hone in on that one. The channel specific teams, right. Had their own way of going about execution, not necessarily around a concern about it. And then these different teams worked with different media agencies, which of course execute against those channel specific teams. Right. So then the problem started in a compound. There was no common path right to execution.

00:16:00:26 - 00:16:21:16
不明
And even what a win look like, universally across the board. And then with the evolving media landscape, right. More channels every day. Right. Open publishers are gearing up, becoming walled gardens. Yeah. There's just more and more channel interactions that our customers are actually interacting with. Right. And those are more opportunities for us to to communicate with them.

00:16:21:16 - 00:16:38:23
不明
But that compounds the series of problems further. Right. More channels means more channel focused teams, which means more disjointed agency strategies. Yeah. And then we had a very huge focus on multi-touch attribution. Right? I kind of mentioned this earlier before, but you know, just looking at how Adobe did things, I went through the whole list of how we talk to customers.

00:16:38:23 - 00:16:55:34
不明
Right. So many of them are offline, right? Half of budgets are still offline. A lot of online budgets are just not measurable from an MTA standpoint. It's when you're anchored so much in MTA. We in Adobe land, right? We had a hard time understanding what was working. Okay. And now here's the cherry on top. Everything got more expensive, right?

00:16:55:38 - 00:17:22:01
不明
Everything got more expensive. But that was actually a bit of a forcing function about, hey, let's take an honest look about how we can improve things. And we feel like we did. We feel like we did. Right. So the solution can be summed up in two words consistency and innovation. Okay, so we changed our operating model. We went ahead and changed your operating model because you said, hey, that's that's not going to fit the need for the growth expectations that we had.

00:17:22:06 - 00:17:39:28
不明
And we got top down buy in. Right? The exact that you saw on stage from Adobe and over the last two days, right where a key part of this and they drove this change. Right. They saw as a benefit for their teams. But also for themselves. So moving from this channel focused teams I talked about right there with disjointed strategies, went to regional focused teams.

00:17:39:28 - 00:17:57:16
不明
Right. They had and then ownership across all channels so they can execute against those regional nuances, regardless of what channels we were talking about. Then we established a global media center of excellence, right, to ensure that all the agency partners were offering off of the same playbook, right. All operating off of the same playbook. So now no one was going rogue.

00:17:57:21 - 00:18:16:40
不明
And then we created a new team that was directly responsible. Or I am highlighting directly responsible, right. They had ownership over the operations of the strategy, making sure that was implemented the right way. Right. There was actually someone who cared about enabling this. Okay. And you know, I know it's just one slide, but this took quite a bit of time.

00:18:16:40 - 00:18:41:33
不明
But the results speak for themselves. Over the last five years, we had an 80% improvement, incremental ROI as an Adobe. Right. And it was not just process, right. We had new technology that got built, which I'll talk about in a second. And Zoe's going to show as well. Right. But really, like the other benefit was those exact that I mentioned before finally had a single pane of glass that they can go to to figure out how the business was operating.

00:18:41:38 - 00:18:57:37
不明
I remember those stats I was talking about like, hey, why are we doing things? And is it even working? Was it worth it? That got all answer for the Adobe execs. It was all with all these efforts into a single view, right? And their teams could truly understand what was working or not. So coming back to the optimization stuff, they can come first.

00:18:57:37 - 00:19:21:26
不明
So first of all, full circle, right? And continue the optimization steps that were planned reach a measure to acquire more customers more effectively. And looking at the technology, right, specifically looking at two of them, our TCB, our CDP collaboration first. Right. Adobe's running campaigns to that system right now. All right. It's a newer toolset. It allows them to change the way they work with key publishers, right, that they partner with.

00:19:21:26 - 00:19:43:08
不明
Remember talking about reach. Do you need help? Where can you find these folks are using our CDP collaboration to do that. And they're reaching more qualified audiences at scale, and they can continually optimize the demand creation against the campaign metrics that they care about, right. Establishing their briefs right, and progress customers through that funnel, right, for driving growth and looking at m m M is an interesting one, right?

00:19:43:08 - 00:20:05:47
不明
That's our acronym for mixed model there. Mix Muller didn't exist before this process. Mixed. There was a series of technology that Adobe Marketing decided that their teams needed in order to enact this. And then it was kind of just homegrown as one of the outputs of this exercise to improve the customer acquisition efforts at Adobe. Right. So that's really what ended up leading towards some of this 80% lift in Rho s.

00:20:05:52 - 00:20:24:07
不明
So all this sounds great in theory. I've hinted at it twice, but now we're going to invite Zoe on stage to introduce yourself and do a quick demo of what is actually it looks like in the product set. And then we'll move over to you, Will and Sean for our panel. My name is Julie. I am on the Expert Solution Consulting team covering the Adobe Experience platform.

00:20:24:12 - 00:21:11:04
不明
And of course, I'm going to be running you through the demo today. So we'll swipe into it now. But my goal today is to show you how brands more strategically plan, reach, measure and optimize their customer acquisition campaigns using Adobe Solutions. Now for the demo today we will be using everyone's favorite demo brand, Luma, which is a fictitious athletic apparel company who is getting ready to launch their 2025 Luma Spring campaign with aggressive growth targets and a question as to what our budget needs to be, the Luma marketing team knows they need to make the most out of every single marketing dollar in order to prove the value of of their efforts in

00:21:11:04 - 00:21:45:02
不明
this campaign. So to do that, we're going to start in Adobe Max modeler, of course, where we can analyze historical campaign performance and spend tied to business metrics such as ROI across all channels, both online and offline. No cookies required. So we can see here that paid media or excuse me, paid social and TV2, which is a fictitious streaming platform to have been performing really well in terms of, conversion and incremental orders.

00:21:45:07 - 00:22:05:43
不明
We also see that we have a bit more room to spend in these areas. We're getting more than a dollar back for every dollar we are spending, which is great insight for me to have going into our 2025 campaign. We're also going to continue to spend in a couple other areas here. We can see that linear TV is performing well.

00:22:05:45 - 00:22:37:05
不明
Sponsored shopping and radio. So we'll, we'll invest in those channels throughout this campaign. And hopefully that won't pop up anywhere. But having all this historical context in mind, we're now going to create our plan. Now, I know that my manager wants to drive $20 million in revenue. So kind of a hefty goal here. But with the newly announced goal based planning from Adobe Mix Modeler, we can set that target here.

00:22:37:10 - 00:22:57:41
不明
And then within Mix Modeler, it will tell us not only if we are able to achieve this goal, but if we are, it will tell us what the budget needs to be in order to achieve the $20 million. So let's see if we are able to do this. We'll create our plan and it looks like our target was achieved.

00:22:57:46 - 00:23:17:53
不明
So we can see that mix modeler is telling us to spend $4 million, which is good to know in order to achieve that goal of 20 million. But before we move on, I want to compare this plan here to my plan last year to be able to justify to my management why we might be spending a little bit more this time around.

00:23:17:58 - 00:23:39:52
不明
So we'll select our two plans and click Compare. And it looks like we are spending a bit more. We're going up to 4 million from 3 million. But I have the data here to back me up. It looks like having up in paid social and TV tube as expected here, is going to yield higher ROI. So that's great for me to know.

00:23:39:52 - 00:24:02:09
不明
In order to justify this budget to my management. Now that we have our plan in place, it's time to create our audiences. We're going to jump into real time CDP to create our audience. And with a natural language prompt, we can go ahead and leverage AI assistant to help us create the perfect audience. So we'll ask what our top audiences are.

00:24:02:09 - 00:24:30:00
不明
And we have a couple options here. I'm going to ask a follow up question to better understand what the forecasted size of this audience is. So it looks like high value cart event nerds will be the perfect audience for me to use for this campaign. We're going to go ahead and save that here in our audience portal, which is where we have our centralized repository of all of our audiences, which helps me activate these audiences at scale.

00:24:30:05 - 00:24:55:50
不明
Now, in this case, as we know, we're going to activate this down to social destinations, as indicated by our mix modeler plan. So we can activate two channels like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and more. And in addition to activating to social, we also want to work with those premium publishers as a, as a strategic resource for my customer acquisition campaign.

00:24:55:55 - 00:25:32:01
不明
So with that, we will use real time CDP collaboration to accomplish this. I'll be able to, connect with premium publishers or reach new audiences and directly activate my campaign, all without having to run complex SQL statements or having to co-mingle expose or copy any underlying customer data. Now, I can either work with real time CDP customers, the hundreds that we have today within this platform, or I can work with non Adobe brands and publishers as well.

00:25:32:05 - 00:26:03:05
不明
In this case, as we know we're working with TV tube. We've worked with them in the past and our plan indicated that we should work with them again for this campaign. So we'll create our project here and we can see some audience insights already. I want to swap out this audience. You'll notice here that because of the interoperability between Adobe Solutions, the audience that we just created within real time, CDP is available here for me to use within seconds.

00:26:03:10 - 00:26:28:41
不明
So we're going to use this audience to overlap with TV tubes audiences in order to have instantaneous audience insights. Now, I just want to reiterate, in the past, this process would have taken multiple days. I would have had to set up a SQL based clean room, worked with engineering to onboard my customer data, and then run complex queries to actually pull these insights.

00:26:28:46 - 00:26:51:02
不明
But as we can see here, with just a couple of clicks, we're able to get these insights for our, for our audience overlap. Now we also are matching based off of partner ID and hashed email, which is maximizing our impact and reach for this campaign. And it looks like reality TV viewers has a very high match rate for us.

00:26:51:07 - 00:27:25:30
不明
So we're going to go ahead and retarget this audience while they're streaming the TV tube app. In addition to leveraging this audience here, we also want to use this audience as a seed for TV tube to create a lookalike audience. For me, this functionality is coming to the product later this year, we'll go ahead and create this lookalike audience, and it looks like TV tube has substantial volume for me to leverage with my prospecting efforts in order to help me reach those conversion goals that I have.

00:27:25:35 - 00:27:51:29
不明
All right, so from here, we will share with the publisher, and in just a few clicks, you saw how we were able to expand our first party audience and also retarget them all while using technology built on Adobe Experience platform. And with that, our campaign is live. So we're targeting those high value car abandoned ads on the left side with our social platforms.

00:27:51:33 - 00:28:16:23
不明
We're also targeting them on TV, too. We can see on the right, and we're targeting that lookalike audience in order to drum up some new business. In addition to these digital channels, we're also targeting customers on non digital as well. So these are channels like radio, linear TV, billboards and more. Let's say that this campaign has been running now for about two weeks.

00:28:16:27 - 00:28:44:04
不明
I want to start to assess what's going on, what's working, what's not, and see if there are any economic, economic influences, that might be affecting my campaign on on the outside. We'll start in real time CDP collaboration to measure how well TV YouTube is performing. Now, we can see within the measurement module here that we have a gained total impressions of 3.2 million, which is awesome.

00:28:44:09 - 00:29:07:57
不明
This is at an average of A2X frequency, meaning our total unique reach is about 1.6 million. So these are great insights for me to have moving forward with great about this is that I'm not waiting until the end of the campaign to see these insights, so I'm able to have more control and access over the reporting while this campaign is in flight.

00:29:08:02 - 00:29:28:42
不明
In the past, I've had to rely on publisher off the shelf reports in order to get this data. So this is definitely a game changer for my strategy here. Now, this collaboration data can also be an input in mix modeler, so that I can analyze how well a TV tube is comparing to my other channels from an incrementality perspective.

00:29:28:42 - 00:29:52:11
不明
So let's head there. Now. We can see over here that connected TV as a whole is performing really well and driving those incremental conversions, and more specifically, our TV tube campaign is, is contributing to that as well. Paid social, of course, is doing well. And if we go back over to this summary, we can see a couple other metrics.

00:29:52:11 - 00:30:21:32
不明
It looks like comparison shopping is outperforming affiliates for now. And linear TV continues to be a steady stream of revenue for me. And some of these channels have click based or behavioral data tied to them. And that's going to allow me to dive into, multi-touch attribution analysis here. So this is important for me to better understand where in the journey these channels are making the most impact.

00:30:21:37 - 00:30:55:30
不明
For example, it looks like connected TV is doing really well at the start of my campaign. And paid search is a really great closer, and it looks like email is a really great buffer in between. So these are great insights that I can bubble up to my leadership. I also will definitely let my colleagues know on the journey management side to lean in to those personalized email marketing campaigns leveraging Adobe Journey Optimizer, and remember those external factors that we were talking about that are running in the background.

00:30:55:35 - 00:31:21:30
不明
I can see some validation of that here. It looks like the downturn in the stock market is not having as much of an impact on my campaign as I would have thought, and my promotions that I'm running are helping to offset any sort of impact of inflation. This is really great to have, just to tell a better story of my entire campaign and, you know, have some context for my leadership to have.

00:31:21:35 - 00:31:50:33
不明
And the reason we're able to access all of this data during the campaign versus after is because Mix Modeler is purpose built on Adobe Experience platform. So we are constantly streaming and data on a deliverability data, specifically on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. And then we can use that to constantly rescore or update our models in order to analyze what's going on, like we see here.

00:31:50:38 - 00:32:14:45
不明
So our last stop within reporting will be, will be our plan and performance to plan. So what we're doing here is understanding what actually happened in our campaign versus what Mix Modeler originally planned for us to see. So I can confirm that we are pacing really well in terms of ROI, which is great to report up to my management.

00:32:14:50 - 00:32:48:38
不明
We also are doing great in terms of orders. We're seeing 50,000 incremental orders from this campaign alone. But on the flip side, if we go over to our budget, we are under pacing in terms of budget, and we have not yet hit that $20 million target. We're just about $1 million shy here. So I will make a follow up task to rearrange some, but rearrange some budget and create a new mixed order plan to really maximize, our revenue here and get to that goal that we're wanting to to achieve.

00:32:48:42 - 00:33:16:01
不明
In the meantime, though, let's jump into customer journey analytics to see if we can analyze any other pockets of efficiency or insights that we might want to share in our status call next week. So Customer Journey Analytics is bringing together data from multiple different data sources, both online and offline. For example, mobile app data, web data, point of sale, call center, you name it.

00:33:16:06 - 00:33:45:09
不明
In the future, we will also be able to layer in alongside this customer journey data metrics from Adobe Mix Modeler and real time CDP collaboration, such as acquisition metrics or paid media. So that will allow us to have a full picture of our campaign tactics in one single system. I will also be able to engage with, AI assistant to actually do data analysis for me.

00:33:45:14 - 00:34:09:50
不明
So for example, I'm going to ask what my total orders were for the last 30 days. And when I ask that CGA AI assistant, it's going to create this great visual for me. And I'm going to ask a follow up question, though we know that this is showing us orders from both online and offline. But I want to know incremental orders, which is data that would come from Adobe Mix Modeler.

00:34:09:55 - 00:34:37:17
不明
So we'll ask that follow up question, and then we'll see that AI assistant will break out our orders for us and show us that Incrementality element. So in addition to looking at, the breakout here, we can see that there's a bit of an uptick right here around November 16th, November 17th timeline. I want to dig a little bit deeper and understand what's driving that uptick in orders.

00:34:37:22 - 00:35:07:28
不明
So we'll go ahead and drag in campaign, or we can break down the campaigns to know exactly what's driving incremental orders. And unsurprisingly, it is our TV tube activating campaign. So that's great to know. From here, I want to dig a little bit deeper specifically into customer interaction and data, looking at some cross-sell analysis. So I want to better understand what are people buying with Luma Cakes.

00:35:07:33 - 00:35:34:53
不明
We'll add that filter in here. And we can see that the number one cross-sell item is luma switch. This is great insight for me to have in order to run a retargeting campaign to suggest the perfect next purchase for my customers. So what I can do here is create an audience from this selection, and I want to target people who are currently, who have bought Luma Cakes, but not yet bought Luma.

00:35:35:03 - 00:36:11:22
不明
Let's go ahead and give it a name, and then we can publish that back to CDP and to Adobe Journey Optimizer for a retargeting campaign. I okay, so that is the end of the demo. All in all, what we saw was really the ability of the Luma marketing team to shift the narrative. They were able to prove the value and the impact they had on growing the Luma Cakes products segment by leveraging a modern marketing and measurement framework and real time audience planning capabilities, all using Adobe software.

00:36:11:27 - 00:36:28:33
不明
So now we will jump into the panel with with, Kiyoshi and Will and Shawn, and you'll hear directly from them how they have driven customer acquisition at their respective organizations. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you.

00:36:28:38 - 00:36:52:13
不明
All right, come on up. We're all in, Shawn. Yeah. Cool. All right, so, Yeah. So we're we're using our data to try to grow our reach, try to engage baseball fans and ultimately get them to, stream, buy tickets and other, business outcomes. So I oversee, for Adobe, actually the marketing and planning and analytics functions.

00:36:52:13 - 00:37:21:54
不明
So, my team spans our digital experiences as digital media. I've been with Adobe about two years, and prior to that was with HP and ran data science and analytics along with Cox Automotive and then went to HSBC and, and Clorox. So, quite a few years in data science and analytics. And actually leveraging media mix, to to answer a lot of the questions where we are talking about today.

00:37:21:59 - 00:37:40:32
不明
It's just I'm always amazed we're still talking about last click, but that's something I maybe when I retire that'll be solved at some point or cookies will eventually just go away and we won't have to worry about it. Awesome. Thanks for the introductions. Right. We got great experience up here across different parts of the acquisition funnel.

00:37:40:36 - 00:37:58:05
不明
Well, I'm going to start with you. Well, so tell us, what's a top concern or what's top of mind for your acquisition efforts, right. Or in MLB right now? Yeah. Well, opening days in a week. So, what's the busiest time of year for all of us? So there's a lot top of mind. Sleep is top of mind.

00:37:58:09 - 00:38:16:35
不明
But I think, for us, I there's a couple, things going on. First, you know, baseball's had a really good run over the last few years. We're on a really, good trend of positive momentum around viewership consumption. You know, we changed the rules a few years ago. Took a half hour off the average game time.

00:38:16:35 - 00:38:35:05
不明
So, you know, you can take your kids to a game on, oh, excuse me, a night game and be home by 10:00, which is amazing for parents. So, a lot of really positive momentum. But we're also dealing with some macro trends in terms of, you know, the, mostly in local media and the media landscape changing significantly.

00:38:35:05 - 00:38:57:02
不明
So I think for us, it's a combination of making sure that we can navigate the headwinds, like media effectively, making sure that we're still able to get baseball fans to to stream and watch the games that they want to, while also making sure that we capitalize on this moment of extreme positive momentum. And I think, a big challenge and something I think a lot about a lot is are we winning by enough?

00:38:57:06 - 00:39:13:11
不明
I think a lot of people, see green numbers and they rest and they say that's that's it. I'm up. I don't have to do anymore. But if you're only up 5% and every other indicators up 50%, you're really down 45%. And so you need to make sure that you, you know, make hay while the sun shines.

00:39:13:11 - 00:39:36:08
不明
Because, you know, like in any business, you know, they're up moments and down moments and you need to make sure that you capitalize on the other moments. Awesome. Thank you for that. Well, arbitration. So you know, you're going to hear a theme with me. And it's I'm not a bitter cookie person, but, I think that, our biggest concern is this narrowing of aperture and, and how we measure.

00:39:36:08 - 00:39:59:06
不明
And it's starting to focus on highly click based media. And so what's happening is we're getting into a bit of a doom loop of just focus in on absolute performance and then not thinking about the next quarter. Right. And so when you're in that you lose your headroom. You can't spend as efficiently. You have nothing buoying the brand.

00:39:59:11 - 00:40:21:44
不明
And so what we're trying to do is extend our outlook on other media and really bring that awareness organizationally and hopefully drive better decisions. Nice. Thanks for that, John. So with this next one right, we're going to put our fireplace in the background. So you guys have seen this before right. We got a nice fireside chat going but we're driving gross.

00:40:21:44 - 00:40:37:31
不明
We got a big old pile of money. Which is going to give you guys an opportunity to brag, right. Brag in front of this big, big chunk of cash in the fireplace. What's something you're most proud of that's going on an acquisitions page? Right? Like, will you touch on a couple of them? But was there one in particular, one additional one you'd like to talk about?

00:40:37:31 - 00:40:54:55
不明
Right. That that's really succeeded. Yeah. You know, a pet project of mine is actually the minor leagues. You know, people think about baseball as the 30 major league teams, but there's 120 minor league teams. And so we sell about 70 million tickets at the MLB level. We sell about 30 million tickets at the minor league level.

00:40:54:55 - 00:41:21:05
不明
And if you look at the map geographically, minor league teams really fill in the holes. Where there aren't major league teams. So for many Americans, domestically, obviously, the closest ballpark is a minor league ballpark. And so if you think about baseball and you think about fandom of a sport, you need to be able to think about all the touch points for the sport and create really tight connections between major and minor league.

00:41:21:10 - 00:41:41:30
不明
You know, experiences and offerings and the journey to the major leagues. But it's also a huge opportunity for us to, you know, meet new fans and learn more about existing fans. And so one of the projects that we're working on right now is to identify, minor league buyers and to store them alongside major league buyers.

00:41:41:30 - 00:42:14:30
不明
So when you start thinking about brand collaborations and I know we'll talk about, you know, data collaboration in a little bit here. But when we start thinking about ways that you can activate against audiences, you're not limited to just the 30 major league, entities. You're thinking about baseball as a sport. So one thing I'm very bullish on and very excited about is ways that we can, continue to build a national database of baseball fans and then work with brands and partners and, and others to really activate against the sport, which, you know, obviously, there's hundreds of millions of people in this country that have a positive view of baseball.

00:42:14:30 - 00:42:34:06
不明
So it's a huge opportunity. And we're really, you know, just starting, so it's it's been a big focus of ours, but it's something I'm pretty excited about. It's a really interesting way to look at reach and growth in other league. That's that's awesome. Sean, how about you. What do you want to talk about? Well let's see, I'm so big.

00:42:34:06 - 00:42:58:33
不明
One for us is again, really thinking about the upper funnel and the true benefit that that provides, throughout, throughout the funnel all the way through to performance. And so we there's a lot of work that's been done on direct effects, which is usually upper funnel eventually gets some kind of contribution to, to the subscription or the purchase.

00:42:58:38 - 00:43:19:56
不明
And if you do that math, the return on investment is horrible. Because you're usually you're looking one quarter, but if you truly are looking at the life of that, of that campaign of, of the channel in which you're delivering that campaign, you get closer to break even. But what we're finding is, is there's an indirect effect.

00:43:19:56 - 00:43:41:59
不明
So and I think we all know this, in our hearts, that as you start to lift, the underlying line kind of momentum of the brand, you get benefits on all of your media. The higher I mean, the more top of mind you are. People are noticing your ads. They perform better. We're actually now able to estimate that indirect effect.

00:43:41:59 - 00:44:09:36
不明
So an example would be, performance media coming at a return of 2.5. We're finding that 0.5 of that is actually directly attributed back to this underlying momentum built by upper funnel investments. So now when you stack up the total returns, it may not happen in quarter, but it happens. And it's a quarter over to again how much we can spend in performance, how much we can spend in some of these more direct channels.

00:44:09:41 - 00:44:33:09
不明
And again, getting the full return of the momentum and build of the brand, defining what that success and how are you going to measure. Right. Yeah, it's super critical. Yeah. All right. So shifting a little bit right. More for any kind of, you know, guidance to the audience. Right. What's a common mistake you guys have seen and possibly, you know, a way to fix that or just, you know, a common learning that you guys have seen that that might be, you know, interesting for the audience to learn about.

00:44:33:14 - 00:45:08:06
不明
How about, you know, go to that first. Okay. Hey, I'm the measurement person. So I'm going to say this, I think thinking about data first, before you move through execution. And then somebody asked what happened. I think I've heard this so many times, and I've experienced it myself, which is, you sign up an agency, you bring them on, they run a campaign, and then you say, hey, I'd really like to get that data, so we can run our own kind of measurement, and it becomes a nightmare.

00:45:08:11 - 00:45:29:45
不明
You're getting an Excel files csvs. If it even gets delivered too many times, there's a fee associated to it. So I would just say, as you're thinking through your relationships with agencies, when you're thinking through just your delivery, making data and the delivery of that data, foundational. Okay. Thank you. John. How about you? Well, yeah, I think, two things that I've seen many, many times.

00:45:29:45 - 00:45:47:35
不明
One is that, you have to be confident in the fact that it's not going to be perfect. You know, I think there's a huge especially when there's, you know, big budgets at play here. There's a lot of, biases towards, you know, measure, measure, measure, make sure, make sure, make sure. Ehm ehm ehm, but no one ever shoots.

00:45:47:39 - 00:46:09:21
不明
And I think you need to sort of acknowledge that all of this needs to be something that you optimize and you can't ever get it right the first time. So I think, you know, letting perfect, be the enemy of good is something I've seen many times. And then conversely, I a lot of times I see that people get really wrapped up in the campaign or the effort and they really, really want it to be successful.

00:46:09:33 - 00:46:28:29
不明
And that clouds their judgment of whether or not it actually is successful. And so you need to be really objective about what the data is telling you. And you really need to be objective about what the goal is. And make sure that if you're doing something and you're not just throwing this pile of money in the fire, because you want it to be something that it's not.

00:46:28:29 - 00:46:47:40
不明
So I think being really honest with yourself about how things are performing, and not, you know, seeing what you want to see, but seeing what you're actually seeing is something that, you know, take some time and experience, but ultimately is really important, you know, that tolerance for truth is so critical. Great. So last one. And then we'll move on with the the key takeaway.

00:46:47:45 - 00:47:18:42
不明
So free profit would have to be a measurement acquisition. Right. But like like what's the emerging technology emerging thing that you're hearing in your work structure that, you know, you think is really going to drive some of this in the future? Yeah. I mean, for us, it's data collaboration. I mean, the idea that we can activate, you know, our core partners and new partners against, you know, a sport, not just a league, but to think about ways that baseball can help, you know, brands tell their stories and help us reach new fans is extremely important.

00:47:18:42 - 00:47:49:24
不明
So we're making a lot of investments in making sure that our data is, you know, open for business, so to speak, and making sure that folks understand that we're interested in using our reach and our, our, you know, our investments in the minor leagues, as I mentioned, to try to, you know, help people tell their stories and then, conversely, to try to see, you know, if there are strategic partnerships we can make with, you know, a triple A or an AARP or, you know, other huge registries of people where we can bring baseball to people who otherwise are not experiencing it.

00:47:49:24 - 00:48:15:59
不明
So I think data collaboration is sort of, you know, endless possibilities for us. And so we're we're really excited about that. Nice. Thanks for that. We think so. This is going to sound crazy, but, I just want cookies to go away. You know, I really, I think just this dependency of partial information and it's becoming more and more, I think, blurry, and it's causing us to have to try to connect things that maybe aren't even there.

00:48:16:04 - 00:48:42:28
不明
And, so I think that that's a huge piece. And, and just for context, C7 probably eight years ago we did a study at Cox and we found that we were basically losing about 40% of cookies. And that grew to 70 to 80% when, when we were just at HSBC. So I'm sorry, at HPE massive and and yet we're still trying to piece and part this together.

00:48:42:28 - 00:49:04:18
不明
And all it's doing again is pushing us to a click. And it's going to get to the point where the only click you're seeing is pretty much search or some kind of paid social that you just go, I'm that can't put all my money there. So just pushing that envelope and and really opening up the funnel to driving consumers is, is I think going to be huge.

00:49:04:33 - 00:49:13:08
不明
Great. Thanks for that, Sean. Thanks for that. Well, a quick hand for our panelists. Thanks, guys.

00:49:13:13 - 00:49:31:26
不明
So we're going to wrap up with a couple of takeaways and the reminder for the survey okay. So we had a couple of cheesy things in here. We're continuing with the motivational posters. So you know very very quickly right. We're going to distill the takeaways down. You heard Sean. And we'll actually get to quite a few of these, right.

00:49:31:26 - 00:49:51:50
不明
You get conviction focus and resilience right. We talked about this a little bit throughout the presentation. But when it comes to a conviction right you're gonna want to get all the stakeholders aligned and ideally have a pretty powerful sponsor if you're gonna shake some of this stuff up. Right. So much on point, try some of these things have been around for for ten years, right, as part of your acquisition pipeline.

So part of that is coming to truth, right. And having tolerance, right. To have an open and honest, sobering conversation about what truth even means. Right. And then that sponsor, hopefully right, can have drive a common understanding right of who's responsible for that truth. Right. So that's where the conviction piece comes in.

Right. Not everything's going to be one. Right. But at least have a start. Right. We had that giant slide that was talking about all those different parts of the acquisition pipeline. Figure out where you want to start, what's urgent, what's the black box right. If something's working right. Thank you. Image. And what if something's working?

And then what can't be disrupted and why? Right. Politics is part of all business acquisition for sure, especially when there's so much focus on making sure that everything's a winner. Right?

Even if you're hitting your targets. Right. Which I have said before, I've talked to so many customers where like, hey, you know, how are things going? What are you measuring? Oh, we're hitting all our numbers. And it's like, okay, cool. Why? Or what's driving that is like crickets. Like, I have no idea. It's like, well, even if you're winning, find out why, see if you can do more.
