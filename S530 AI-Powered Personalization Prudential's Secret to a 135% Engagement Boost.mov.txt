00:00:00:01 - 00:00:30:39
不明
All right. I think we're close. Still some stragglers coming in. You'll find this is a very unserious group up here, so we'll probably be heckling all of you heckling people as they come in. So be prepared. Honestly, so grateful for all of you, for getting up on the third day. For being here. I don't know if you know, you all of you probably have felt, the energy on the beginning with the main stage presentation.

00:00:30:46 - 00:01:02:31
不明
There is a lot that we are, presenting, on in this area of AI. And a genetic and, an agent for experimentation. A lot of this exciting news for those that are practitioners of Adobe target, those in the testing and personalization space. We've had AI for years in terms of different decisioning, and models, that can score and learn over time.

00:01:02:36 - 00:01:30:02
不明
Gen AI, though, is unlocking all kinds of opportunities. I think we all know when we are testing or we're, you know, personalizing, you start to show the results. The results are significant. You people around the organization are coming to you with ideas. Scale becomes an issue. And there's always in the experimentation and personalization space which target's been in for nearly 20 years now, believe it or not.

00:01:30:07 - 00:02:06:51
不明
And we've been talking about personalization scale for that time. We're at an inflection point with gen AI right now where we can look at those areas of the testing process, the full iterative testing and personalization process from ideation to insights, and then bringing that back for refinement of the strategy. All those areas where we've had those bottlenecks, where we've had obstacles be it, you know, we want to create multiple variations rapidly that we can get out and see how they perform and identify the element that's contributing the most.

00:02:06:55 - 00:02:39:38
不明
You know, we're the change makers in the organizations, and now we've got an agent for change, which in AI to solve those issues. And now to be able to get to greater heights, greater scale. And that's why I am so honored to have two very progressive, leaders in this space from Prudential sharing some super impressive. I think we had pretty much every buzz word possible or, in the title, but impressive impact in being one of the first to embrace gen AI.

00:02:39:43 - 00:03:01:04
不明
I'll talk a little bit later about how we've got Gen. I think about Firefly in the visual experience Composer and target for content creation coming in April. There's a beta right now. We've got a new module that integrates with target that helps with generative experiments. There's a session on that today for ideation and identifying the best opportunities for impact.

00:03:01:17 - 00:03:27:19
不明
So those areas that have been nebulous, that we've left up to the business practitioner to figure out. We're now having Jenny help us. We're not handing the reins over. You're going to hear in the presentation today the human influence, the human element very much needs to still be there. But wouldn't it be great like a calculator for all the computation, the mundane, time consuming aspects of experimentation and personalization to be assisted with?

00:03:27:19 - 00:03:46:33
不明
Jen I I'm Drew Burns. I've been in you probably if you've heard or seen a webinar or anything having to do with target over the years, I've been involved with it. It again, my honor, I love gathering with, like minded folks and practitioners and hearing your stories and where you're at working on Art of the possible, and this is a huge art of the possible.

00:03:46:37 - 00:04:06:18
不明
I'm hoping that you're hearing all of this about gen AI, energetic, frameworks and agents like the experimentation agent. You're going to take it back and you're going to embrace it in the way, that Joaquin and Ashley have. And so with that, I will hand it off to them to take you through their accomplishments. Thank you. Thank you.

00:04:06:23 - 00:04:23:25
不明
It's been a wonderful journey working with you for this. So hi everyone. My name is Ashley Shreddies and I'm so delighted that all of you woke up this morning a month to having all that fun last night and joining us this morning. So hopefully you're fully caffeinated. We're ready to go. I have been with Prudential about four years now.

00:04:23:27 - 00:04:45:34
不明
I started in our financial advisors business known as Prudential Advisors, and I have about 18 years of marketing experience. I started when I was five. Okay. I am also an identical twin. Yes. That's true. She is a teacher and I am the creative out of the the right brain, left brain type thing. And it is my first Adobe Summit.

00:04:45:39 - 00:05:07:54
不明
So. And thank you. Thank you. Oh, wow. What a great community already. Thanks. I got my first clap. Check that out. Okay, so, preparing for this summit was a really interesting, opportunity for me because I didn't know what to expect. So I actually went to my inner circle, and I asked them a question about what should I do to prepare?

00:05:07:55 - 00:05:29:15
不明
How should I act? It's also been a long time since I've been to a really large conference. Thank you Covid. And I said to my mom, how should I be? What? What should I be? Totally professional, actually. Or should I just be more about myself? And I really like being myself. And she said, be yourself. So this is me.

00:05:29:20 - 00:05:49:37
不明
I am a marketing unicorn because I have the strategy side. I also have the tactical execution, and I've done it in about five different industries. I've worked in travel. I've worked in human capital management. I worked in construction, if you can believe that. And now I'm in financial services, and I've also done it some time in healthcare as well.

00:05:49:42 - 00:06:11:24
不明
And then I asked my four year old son, who is a Covid baby, and said, hey, Logan, when mommy gets nervous on stage, what should I imagine? And he said that I should pretend everyone is a dinosaur. Hopefully you're not all aggressive like this, but you all look pretty happy. So that's wonderful. But I thought that that was really funny.

00:06:11:29 - 00:06:29:54
不明
And then Joaquin is a veteran, and I said, Joaquin, what should I do to open up? And he said, tell a dad joke. And so I have a dad joke. And I will say I will share it in a minute. But I also want to just call out one thing. There is the laugh cry emoji over this person's gender.

00:06:30:00 - 00:06:48:57
不明
This is a generation using Firefly. All of these were actually. And, it's because we don't generate humans yet. It does not do it well. Watch the teeth in generated photos and hands. Those are the dead giveaways, at least from what I'm seeing in AI right now. So we have want to say authentic to our brand and Prudential.

00:06:49:10 - 00:07:10:07
不明
And we made the decision not to generate humans yet. So you ready for my dad joke? Yeah. You ready? Yeah. All right. So why did the. I want to go to marketing school? Why? Thank you. So it could learn how to make better impressions, but, But was that funny? It was kind of stupid. It's fine. I tried really hard.

00:07:10:12 - 00:07:29:50
不明
Thanks, Joaquin. You set me up for that one. All right, your turn. Is that my my turn. It is your turn. All right. That was a good introduction. Hello, all. So, They told me to do my best I impression. So, it didn't work. We're gonna have to try again later. But, I'm really happy everybody's here.

00:07:29:51 - 00:07:50:03
不明
Whoa. She's got to be careful there. This is really cool to see everybody out here, because it kind of is bringing my long time, all time, 16 years of target experience. That's crazy. I mean, even more so, like, my daughter is here in the industry. This is really cool. She's never seen me actually speak live. So very excited about that.

00:07:50:07 - 00:08:05:21
不明
They had it, I don't know, not as cool as an identical twin, but I do love spicy food. You know, this is not me. And go find some wings that are really hot and try it out. No, I they have that flavor, of course. And unlike Ashley, this is my 15th. There'll be some. That is crazy.

00:08:05:25 - 00:08:31:55
不明
So what we did kind of along the variations, we said, hey, what does it look like if, someone's been to, 15 summits? So let's go ahead and check that out. Drew, you had your ten now and again, another slide later. So, so that. No, this is interesting. So, apparently when I get older, my half Mexican side is going to come out even more.

00:08:32:00 - 00:08:53:42
不明
And, kind of looks like one of my uncles and not the most attractive one. So, we try, but, all jokes aside, now, you know, if you know me, all jokes are not done, that's for sure. But, we, are celebrating our hundred and 50 year, which is pretty cool. On that note, I know Marriott, if you guys, if you guys missed it, they're coming up on the 100.

00:08:53:56 - 00:09:08:47
不明
And if you missed that opening note, I gotta say, she did a phenomenal job. So you guys should watch on my back. That was really good. But she did not pay me for that, by the way. That is just really how I feel. So obviously, we're in financial services. We have 40,000 employees and sales associates worldwide.

00:09:08:56 - 00:09:39:47
不明
We are pretty cool. We have 50 million customers in 50 countries. Who? Over 50 countries. And, again, our team, 365 different members, marketers, strategists, copywriters, brand experts, designers. Yes, yes yes, yes. We're across five business lines and we have 11 product owners all sitting right here, across our martech platform. So, pretty cool team. Yes, we are an Adobe shop.

00:09:39:52 - 00:10:06:06
不明
That's why we're speaking. We have a Am app, a Adobe Analytics, MGA, Marketo, target, Firefly custom models. We've done Dolby Express, generate variations. We are part of so many of the pilots in there. And it's great. It's great to actually be, able to suggest changes that work better for you. But we've done the target. I, we did the target interface.

00:10:06:10 - 00:10:22:43
不明
We did the app assistant and Gen Studio, and I think we're going to join. I forgot the name of it. Whatever product name they came up with that they'll change in two weeks. Mentation accelerator. There you go. There you go. Experiment. We're going to be part of that one in April as well, which is pretty exciting.

00:10:22:48 - 00:10:43:53
不明
And yeah. Okay, so moving on. Personalization at scale. I saw your eyes roll in the back because that term has been use, if you will, say, 1 to 1, there's all kinds of ways that you can talk about personalization. Right. But the bottom line, the goal for us from a program perspective is we want to speak to the individual and everything we do.

00:10:44:00 - 00:11:02:17
不明
When you come to our site, our goal is to give you the experience that you're looking for. That's ultimately the case. And so what what are we trying to do? We want customer loyalty. And we want to give you the, what I want to say there. Oh, yeah. The we want to exceed your expectations. That's right.

00:11:02:22 - 00:11:20:48
不明
Of what we show you. And again, all of that is to get down to that 1 to 1 level. It's a journey. You continue to do it. It's more okay, we had a fantastic year this year. We really did, from a experimentation and personalization program perspective, the goal coming in, and again, as you know, is I've been here a year.

00:11:20:52 - 00:11:52:36
不明
The goal was basically education, helping people to understand the possible. Right. And that really happen. And it started it's the first year of it, it's going to be continuing. New things come out. We're going to continue to learn. We're going to continue to grow and understand things. Personalization is part of the DNA of the company. It is I really believe that we are now at that point, and we have personalize or avatars across at least four of our different domains, and we're going to continue to do more and more, what are we using?

00:11:52:40 - 00:12:11:54
不明
Everything. But just, call outs, you know, we use audiences, from browser behavior. We're doing, traffic source data, that's all from Adobe Analytics. We're doing geo targeting. We are we have advisor information coming in that we are then targeting because we have a bunch of different types of customers coming in that we want to show them different content.

00:12:11:54 - 00:12:28:37
不明
You don't want to see the same thing if you're interested in finding an advisor versus if you are one and you want people to talk to you, right. And then, from and oh, these entities are great. So we're doing category for entities of course from target. But we also have a bunch of other affinities that we have, in the site.

00:12:28:42 - 00:12:51:03
不明
Data is a big part of it. Right? We need the data persistency across the different domains. We need to understand who you are, what you want. And that's again, going back to what I was saying before giving you the experience that that we want to surpass your expectations. And then, of course, I don't think we haven't heard, but of course, exactly, exactly love numbers.

00:12:51:03 - 00:13:14:58
不明
So we did actually set a goal, and we surpassed that by 128%, which is phenomenal, which made for a great year. But. All right, there you go. You got all the personalization stuff. We had a couple successes, when it came to AI, which we're going to talk about here. But really, what we're looking forward to, as well as everything that we've talked about, is how much more we bring the AI in to, you know, be better this next year.

00:13:14:58 - 00:13:34:48
不明
So on that note, unfortunately, I will be back to talk to you in a little bit, but we're going to pass it back to Ashley. Let her talk to you more about the AI pieces. So thank you for listening. Thanks. Walk in. Yep. Great job. Hey. All right, so one thing I did not tell you all yet that I really need to tell you is what does a director of generative I do?

00:13:34:53 - 00:14:01:46
不明
I'm the first one. Okay, so when when I find out, I'll let you know. I'm just kidding. So. But no, this is so my role. I just mentioned to you not too long ago that I am a marketer's marketer. Through and through, I can strategize and I can tactically execute like a boss. So knowing all of that, it's important that I build evangelism and I build education.

00:14:01:46 - 00:14:28:50
不明
I guess I'm pulling from my sister's hat on that one, but whatever. We shared a womb. It's cool. But also really enhancing the overall capabilities of our marketing team, those 365 marketers that Joaquin just mentioned, those are my biggest clients. In addition to our friends that are part of, the businesses as well, because we support the businesses and those two agencies use these platforms that we're talking about.

00:14:28:55 - 00:15:00:52
不明
So when it comes to AI, I would argue and you probably have heard this several times now, that we are all pioneers, we were the first absolutely, 100%. And it all started with the things that we know CRM, programmatic, advertising, personalization. We created the rules for the machines and the machines listened. Now, as we think about ourselves and what we're doing and focusing on with the new AI, we have to talk to our AI a certain way.

00:15:00:57 - 00:15:33:32
不明
We have to say, please help me, or we have to bribe it, or we have to talk to it like a little pet. Like who's a good AI? You're a good AI. Please help me. I need some help. So it's really just to get all the outputs that we want. This is ever changing. And so what? My goal for today, for all of you is to whether you're in your early journey with generative AI or you're more progressive like we are, I want to give you something that you can take away because really, the future is human and machine, and I'm here with my 500 or so new friends that are right here to make

00:15:33:32 - 00:16:03:45
不明
you all the heroes of the story. Okay, so at Prudential, who's involved with AI, I get this question a lot. And I actually attended a financial services roundtable that I was presenting at. And I will tell you a very brief story. So it's 2023. ChatGPT was released in 2022. Okay. So just remember that 2023 is actually when Prudential decided to make the to make the, I mean, a really important part of our strategy.

00:16:03:45 - 00:16:29:07
不明
And so we formed a responsible AI committee, which is comprised of our chief data office, which is global technology, privacy, security, legal risk, all of the people that were scared of, to be frank. But, it's important to note that that is the key. And what I'm really hoping for is now that you're all at this conference, if you are kind of having a struggle getting started, you can say, look at the success that Prudential is having.

00:16:29:15 - 00:16:47:58
不明
Look at the success that Marriott is having. That is important that you need to be showing it just to show from a business perspective and get your most senior leaders involved as well. I'm sure plenty of you have heard that several times, so why cannot I actually sit on the in the marketing team for MarTech? So martech strategy.

00:16:48:00 - 00:17:16:04
不明
We have approximately 11 product owners. I'm also a product owner and we all work together to support the businesses as well as our, our agencies that we just talked about marketing, creative services, brand, all use our solutions. And then we also partner with our friends@prudential.com. Hey, Warren, just to ensure that we are giving them the tools and solutions that they need as well, because really we treat our website as a product.

00:17:16:17 - 00:17:44:17
不明
It is. We have thousands of pages and we want to ensure that they are operating accordingly, and we make it easy to do so. So personalization is really like the satisfying experience for the user. It's kind of like pasta and then the cheese which makes it delicious is the content that you all are generating. And the fact of the matter is, even with AI, content is still going to be key.

00:17:44:22 - 00:18:00:16
不明
Even though it's going to be easier to generate, it's still going to be a problem because there's a big difference between AI generated content that stinks and I generate and I generate content that rocks and gets people excited. And so that is something I'm really, really passionate about and something I'm going to share with you soon. So don't leave.

00:18:00:18 - 00:18:23:00
不明
No one leave. Thank you. Okay, so, hitting uncharted territory can be scary. And that's exactly where I was, quite frankly. And, leading through it can be difficult, as we all know. But what's more difficult for me and walking knows this is keeping my mouth shut. Whatever. I know what I don't want, laughed oh, man. All right, that's okay.

00:18:23:00 - 00:18:42:07
不明
I tried, no matter where you are in using AI, it really boils down to these things that you say. So everyone take pictures of this slide because you really do need the alignment. You do need to set expectations with your partners. You need the stakeholder buy in and the executive buy in so they know what they're doing and can evangelize what you're doing as well.

00:18:42:21 - 00:19:01:13
不明
And then we're going to be talking today about tracking and analytics. My favorite saying I would say that I made it up. I'm pretty sure I did. I'm not sure. But in marketing, as we all know, you get what you measure, right? So it's important that you are setting baselines with using generative AI and not using generative AI.

00:19:01:15 - 00:19:19:07
不明
It can be time to market. It can be time to creation. It can be the SLA that you currently have. Think about all of those things. In addition to the regular tracking and analytics and measurement and the fun vanity things that you're measuring today. So let's talk responsible AI for a second, because I know that there's a lot of questions.

00:19:19:12 - 00:19:39:34
不明
So I am not a lawyer. I am a straight marketer. But so these are some of the considerations that we think about when we're talking about AI solutions. So indemnification of outputs Adobe has been a wonderful partner to us. They indemnify what we're putting out in Firefly, which is wonderful. You need to have that. So you're not infringing on people's copyright.

00:19:39:39 - 00:20:10:22
不明
In addition, there's a difference between closed lines and open arms. Closed loops are the ones that you will be using. And, they do not retrain with your data. It's not open source. It's all good. The open ones are the opposite of that. They are possibly training with your data. You have to look into that and then obviously consider, if it's something that that you want to use, we make a decision at Prudential to not include any PII in our generative capabilities right now, because they're not approved to and in marketing, we really don't.

00:20:10:22 - 00:20:37:28
不明
Even though we deal with with PII, PII, sometimes we don't want to use it as a generative, capability currently for marketing specifically. Also, I mentioned the no, no retraining with company data. So I'm not going to go into that. But the explainability piece and the eliminating bias. So AI is a machine. It does have bias. And so it's important to know that whatever you're creating need to explain how it came about.

00:20:37:40 - 00:21:00:49
不明
So you do need to care about the data that your eyes are being trained on. Really focus on that. Ask those questions when you're speaking to partners. So all right this is the case study. Are you ready. Let me hear it here. Yeah. Oh I love it okay. So to so to set the stage, I want you to imagine you're in receipt.

00:21:00:54 - 00:21:29:13
不明
You worked really hard to get an AI tool approved, but that's literally half the battle. You have fantastic partners in Adobe that I just mentioned, and they want to see you succeed, but only that the spotlight is on you. It's your job now to create your mac and cheese delight. And so, this use case is the first project that I ever worked on for my team.

00:21:29:18 - 00:21:53:58
不明
And so I'm really excited to talk to you about it and to set the stage. This is what the page looked like before. So we started really small. By the way, this was one page that we were looking at and it belonged to a business that was decommissioned. It was sunset. It was no more. And so what we had to do was we have to decide, okay, so let's figure out what we can do.

00:21:53:58 - 00:22:10:42
不明
This page, we need to act fast. And the content was on there was good. It was fine. But it did not delight the customer. And because it was getting many clicks and people visiting and all the time it had a pretty high bounce rate, that was really challenging for us. So we wanted to make sure that we created a really good experience.

00:22:10:55 - 00:22:36:11
不明
So the first thing we did was we reassigned the page to my business at the time. So I was part of Prudential Advisors. We were so because the businesses own the pages, which I love that strategy, because now you actually have someone who's going to be vocalizing the things that they need. And, from a culture standpoint, we had Adobe generate variations, approved, but we weren't really sure how we were going to use it.

00:22:36:16 - 00:22:55:15
不明
And so there were so many opinions about it. And this is really my my first tip for you all. And that is think bigger. If you're doing one page, think what you could do that page due to that page to make it even great, a great experience because we had talked about, oh, let's just do the hero like it's fine.

00:22:55:15 - 00:23:15:01
不明
That gets like the most clicks. It's okay. But the broader experience that we're looking for is for it to show up and search and truly be an experience that speaks to the user. So we decided on a persona and we decided on the content that we were going to create and the persona that we selected. It was actually someone who was a retiree that was a little bit older.

00:23:15:01 - 00:23:33:48
不明
They were retiring in the next ten, 15 years or so, and so we were giving them content, delivering content on how they should get ready and the different options and how they could get ready. So from a framework perspective and boiling it down even further, it's important to note that you need the platform that's first and foremost.

00:23:33:48 - 00:23:52:36
不明
So work with your legal teams, you know, do all those things. That's important. But it may be even before that, identify what is the use case. What are some of your biggest challenges when it comes to the business? Not even I don't even worry about the don't worry about the tools. Worry about the problems that you have now and then select the platform.

00:23:52:40 - 00:24:11:43
不明
Get your stakeholders aligned to all of that. Keeping the communication. Focus on the scope. So what are you going to do? This was one page guys. So like I'm going to keep saying that because I want you to understand that this was a big win. But it was only one thing that we were doing and were really working to scale it and then focus on the established, established roles as well.

00:24:11:43 - 00:24:33:18
不明
So who's going to do what? Who's going to do the prompting? Who's going to validate the output? Who's going to put it through compliance? Those are the things that we had to establish. And the way that that looks for us is this. So we start with a creative brief. Everything that we do starts with a brief. Then we come up with the content strategy really important.

00:24:33:18 - 00:24:56:06
不明
So who are you targeting? You know focusing on the persona, all those things, typical marketing stuff that we always do. And then we focus on the content production. And, I'll tell a really quick story, on the content production piece, we also use AI to brainstorm what we were doing from a content standpoint. We so we said, hey, we have these ideas and we want to target this audience.

00:24:56:06 - 00:25:15:19
不明
What content should we be using in that? Was it something I said, guys, I'm sorry. We told you we were going to ask. I work with them. I'm just messing with them. So I have one of those is our boss and that's what you get. Thank you. All right. Anyways, and and then and then we focused on the editing process.

00:25:15:19 - 00:25:40:33
不明
So if you're wondering where humans are in the loop here, humans are in every step of the process. But you see the robot with the heart eyes. That's where we're using generative AI, all of those places. And so, editing is a human element compliance review. But although we are looking at compliance review tools now and running some successful pilots, which have been awesome because they're we are creating because we're creating so much more content, we're actually having a bottleneck with our compliance folks.

00:25:40:33 - 00:26:00:14
不明
So it's important that we address that. And I'm sure a lot of you can feel the same way. And if you have questions, we can talk about it after the session. But in addition, publishing it and monitoring and iterate it, iterating over it, that has been great. So from a use case execution standpoint, I talked about the personas.

00:26:00:28 - 00:26:18:09
不明
Who is your audience? Identify who that is. You could even do two audiences if you like, but it can get a little bit challenging. For this particular use case, we wanted to start with one to see to prove out this proof of concept. Brainstorming content ideas, I mentioned the I piece we did, I did use AI and said, hey, I have this persona.

00:26:18:14 - 00:26:40:03
不明
What sort of information would they be interested in just to brainstorm those ideas? Then you craft your content with AI. So I'm going to tell a really quick, anecdote and tip on this one. So, when we did the pilot with Adobe Generate variations, it was a beta. And so we were looking at, okay, how do we use this platform?

00:26:40:08 - 00:27:02:39
不明
And quite frankly, the first time that we generated, the content through prompting, the content was so boring, like, you could have slapped any anybody's logo on the page and it would have sounded like that financial services company. But the key differentiator, and this is my number one tip, probably for the whole presentation, is what are the pain points you're addressing?

00:27:02:43 - 00:27:23:31
不明
Put it in the prompt that will help the eye understand and get closer to the output that you're looking for. What are the top three things that that person is looking for? What are the top challenges that your, product or service solves? That's what that's what we're using. Ultimately. And then last but not least, feed it reliable sources.

00:27:23:31 - 00:27:49:41
不明
So what I love about Adobe Generate variations is that we, in fact, are using blog posts from our financial education hub on prudential.com to feed it good information. Think about the derivative content that you can create using generative AI. That is what that is exactly what Adobe Generate variations did for us, and it helped us tremendously, tremendously. And it actually got our compliance folks much more comfortable with what we were doing.

00:27:49:46 - 00:28:08:05
不明
And then last but not least, human in the loop. Always review edit it, make it great. Because truly AI is AI, but it's the human that really makes it awesome and memorable. All right, Joaquin, you are up, I am next. I want to use this or you want you trust me. Yeah, I don't you trust me. I trust you to clear.

00:28:08:06 - 00:28:33:30
不明
That's a bad idea. That's okay. So from an experiment design perspective, and in general, you can see that we have 1030, 3030. Yes, we do up there. I will normally recommend that you split it 25, 25, 25, 25 in any, any test, not just this test, but that's generally what I, what I try to encourage in this case, as you can see, we went with ten because we really felt confident that the new variations were going to outperform.

00:28:33:30 - 00:28:51:23
不明
And we were right. So we went with the 1033 and 30. Now, this is not an AB testing, a personalization. How do you be successful creating one? But I do want to give you guys a few things to take home that we, that we, did for this, but really should be doing for any personalization and a B testing.

00:28:51:23 - 00:29:07:15
不明
You do so making sure the messages are unique enough. The worst thing you can do is just have three things that are exactly the same. I'm sure you've heard this before, but it's important. So when we looked at the variations, we had to make sure that they were going to at least have something visible. That was different enough between the three segments.

00:29:07:15 - 00:29:29:46
不明
Where are they coming from? So is it URL? Is it behavior? Is it email? We did use the API for this because we were able to pull that data about our customers into it and utilize that and then traffic. Do you have enough traffic, which we obviously did. That was the reason for this. Conversions. Make sure you look at your analytics data and you know what, you're going to determine success.

00:29:29:51 - 00:29:44:02
不明
And then where's that going to live? Right. So what's the goal? A lot of people make the mistake where they, Oh, well, we just want it to be better or we just want more engagement. And then you go, you get the Tescos, and then people come back and go, oh, well, I think it's better because of this.

00:29:44:02 - 00:30:01:08
不明
Or I think it's better because of that. So it's very important that you establish the goals. Everybody is. They know what the goals are going to be. They know where you're going to be getting the information from and everybody is aligned, or at least you force them to be aligned. So, so next I get to share the results and wins.

00:30:01:13 - 00:30:17:47
不明
So as I told you, all the things we did and I get to say we were successful, so three new landing pages created in hours versus days. That is big. And you could take snapshot. This is all real. We're not fluff in you. I promise I'll put it all out. I don't know whatever everybody wants to see the good.

00:30:17:48 - 00:30:36:51
不明
Yes. Let's go. Okay. Two hours to generate the content and 30 minutes. Edit. Now, if you are that person, you know how big a deal that is? Of course. Why we're here. 135% engagement. Okay, executives in the room or anybody else here. This does not mean everything you go back and do has to be 135% engagement.

00:30:36:55 - 00:30:53:06
不明
Okay? This is a huge win. But as you know, for those in the target industry, if you get a 2% lift, you're excited. If you get anything in the double digits. Those are big wins, right? So this was just a huge win for us. But double digits, that's when you're celebrating right? That's when you take everybody out for a pizza party.

00:30:53:16 - 00:31:22:28
不明
You're six. And as you're older maybe you go and have some beers. And then we measured all this analytics, have a great partner on the analytics team. Nick. Max is sitting right here, who actually build out some great dashboards for us to see you, too. And, that's where we measure everything. But that being said, you know, there's other tools, which is CGA, and I'm going to go into that right now, about how you should think about when you learn things, what you should do.

00:31:22:28 - 00:31:54:00
不明
Right. So target gives you a great results. You look at them, Adobe Analytics, you get new segments, right. You send those into your app and then those are new groups, right? You learn things about your customers. And then you send those back to target. As you know, you could you either could just measure it and say, okay, how these segments perform across all of my different experiments or, ab tests, experiments, personalization, or you have I generate new content.

00:31:54:05 - 00:32:11:35
不明
What a concept. Seems like it matches the title. Or you don't. Right. It's really up to you. It's really about where you're trying to go. But the idea is that you're continuing to learn. You're getting new segments, new behaviors, and that stuff goes back into the process and just keeps running. I know we've seen these circles many, many times, but it's ones like that.

00:32:11:40 - 00:32:31:15
不明
Just a lot of circles. Yeah. And so you just continue to to do that part. And by the way, on the type of presenter I want to be like, are there any questions on that? But we are going to have questions at the end. We're going to pass the mics around. So just know that. And also afterwards if you want to talk, I only I know I only reference a few of the ways that you should look at, how you build out a program.

00:32:31:15 - 00:33:04:44
不明
But happy to talk more afterwards as well. Okay. Next. All right. So as we said, we're an Adobe shop. We have a bunch of these. I'm sure you guys do as well. We are utilizing, work front am from the content perspective, from a data perspective, we're using, the real time CDP, Adobe Analytics CJA. I think we're doing a little bit smaller, not a Am right now, but, and then journeys, we have the J ops, but of course Adobe's as you saw in all the presentations, slamming down their throat.

00:33:04:44 - 00:33:23:06
不明
If you don't have a Geo, you're in trouble. So we're gonna have to figure that one out. But, we have Adobe, target and Marketo. So we're really utilizing all of the the products. It's fantastic. And then Firefly generative experience models. And of course, we're using AP, although I don't think our AP person is here, but there you go.

00:33:23:11 - 00:33:40:12
不明
And I think they actually change the slide already. I think I saw one on slide that they added something else here. So keep well I did it later time. Well I did it later. All right. Now drew wants to get back up here. We promised him a few more minutes from Adobe Perspectives. He's got to give you guys quick little sales pitch.

00:33:40:12 - 00:33:56:24
不明
Just three minutes. So we're only limited. We just do not leave it. Time says we time them. Yes, because. Hi, guys. We're going to stuff coming into the product. We're going to jump into the future stuff. And we're also going to talk about just like some takeaways. So just stick with us for a little bit. Just kind of talk about where we're going next.

00:33:56:29 - 00:34:20:02
不明
And I'll pass it over to drew sales pitch. Thank you. It's not a sales pitch. Thank you. In we've heard a lot about GDI. We've seen it in action. I just want to call out because I'm so proud. Target users are the trailblazers when it comes to this. It's opening up and unlocking greater efficiencies. I love the the KPIs we were looking at.

00:34:20:02 - 00:34:38:20
不明
It wasn't just conversion, lift and revenue. We love that it resonates. We can report on that all day. Well, what about cost savings, time savings, resource savings. How quickly we can, you know, when we're presenting on these activities is like, how can we do more? How much, you know, I want to do more, I want to do more.

00:34:38:31 - 00:34:57:32
不明
Now we can do more. And so what we want to do is talk about pain points in the prompts is, focus, Jenny on your pain points. And so you're going to see it's rolling out over the next few weeks, a new modernized UI with greater efficiency and updates all across the board, including our recommendations, workflow, AI assistance.

00:34:57:32 - 00:35:18:43
不明
So we're talking about an experimentation agent, which I'll get to, but also AI in the tool itself. You know, we can use Firefly, we can use Gen Studio and for generating content outside or in the ecosystem with Adobe, a lot of great tools out there that are leveraging gen AI for content generation. We wanted to bring it into the Visual Experience Composer.

00:35:18:43 - 00:35:51:49
不明
So as you're building activities in target, you have the, the, the text, that you can generate based on, all different types of factors. The images are there for you to create variations. We want to get up to scale. We want to be able to to experiment. Quick, more quickly. I love the learnings that we were able to, to get from being the trailblazers and trying out these features and embracing them because it brings a lot to, to this space, specifically cDNA experimentation, being able to park us at Anak.

00:35:51:54 - 00:36:18:37
不明
Akamai edge worker, let's say our edge worker to for near latency free deployment. There's a lab about that today on InSight's dashboard. So you can show all the brilliance that you're generating, including the revenue lift as well as the efficiencies that you've created. And then finally, we heard about agents on the stage, again, working behind the scenes, making you more intelligent and more efficient, but also allowing you to engage with them.

00:36:18:37 - 00:36:49:19
不明
So it's not automation taking over, but it is an agent that is, crafted to focus on a specific area. And the, Agent Experimentation Accelerator module. And but an add on for target allows you to ideate with gen AI, and it's AI that's receiving the activities that you've run, the audiences you've created, the content you've created. And so it's going to be surfacing up these opportunities that Ashley was talking about.

00:36:49:19 - 00:37:10:27
不明
They were able to identify that location that was just right. Experimentation Accelerator will be prioritizing that based on your data, crunching the numbers and showing you those opportunities. It also projects outcome, and it's super accurate. Adobe.com has been using it for quite some time now. They've seen massive results in terms of the quality of the activities they're running.

00:37:10:31 - 00:37:30:55
不明
And like a 200% revenue impact. So big stuff to play around with. And we're hoping and and I know they have been inspiring Ashley and Lachy and are showing you just how you can embrace it in your organization. So really, really happy, with the session and having it back over to talk about the future of Prudential. That wasn't too bad, actually.

00:37:30:58 - 00:37:51:41
不明
I've heard some more sales pitches. So, and the reality is I was part of the target, the roundtable thing, and, it does look pretty cool. And I promise I'm going to be part of that group, so I'm not going to let them just throw out some crap this time. Okay? Actually, one of the thing experimentation accelerator you want, there's a beta happening right now.

00:37:51:41 - 00:38:12:15
不明
So you can reach out to, your, your resources at Adobe to get, signed up for that. Sorry. No, no, no. Worse. You have something important to say. It's important. So, okay, just a couple things. We're kind of trying to sum up everything that we were talking about, right? The best practices and where we're going. I guess the future is probably more to the right side, but that's okay.

00:38:12:19 - 00:38:28:46
不明
We talked about it. Comfort with AI, trusting the process with humans in the loop. Again, that's the biggest part, getting everybody to realize, yes, this is we're part of this. You can trust this pieces. This is how we're going to utilize it. We're not going to get rid of you. You know, all that good stuff. I mean, that's really what I think people a lot of fear here.

00:38:28:46 - 00:38:54:32
不明
Right. Make it part of the content life cycle, the management of it, compliance, creative, all that good stuff. Again, really important for us. As many segments as you can get access those. And I say important here obviously because you don't want segments that aren't real, but as many of the same things are in there. So you can really start to learn, learn, go back to that slide of feeding things back in, understanding more, feeding things back in understanding more.

00:38:54:32 - 00:39:14:58
不明
That's not a really boring the way I was saying that. It's really exciting feeding stuff back in or so and then again, you'll hear different conversations about showing success. What I would tell you is it's important to show success, right? AB testing personalization is to learn 100%. You have to convince that that is part of it.

00:39:14:58 - 00:39:32:21
不明
A failed test, a failed experiment, failed personalization is all part of the process. But you do have to have successes otherwise learning like, well, we just keep learning and not having success. So try to focus on some things that are going to get that out the gate, especially with AI in the in the as part of the process.

00:39:32:25 - 00:39:50:37
不明
Okay. So where are we going? So look, the Adobe Target and Adobe personalization, if you are a have been around for a while, you know, this has been there for years, right. That is existed the eyepiece in that there is a trust factor. Right. Because it's selling algorithms in the back or you don't get to see what the algorithms are doing.

00:39:50:42 - 00:40:06:13
不明
But I do suggest, as we're going to do, we're going to test it out in certain areas just to see if it works. Some, some customers I've talked to in the past. Yeah, it works great for us. Some others say we needed to do five other things, find out. Take a look, try it on some pages, see if it works for you.

00:40:06:18 - 00:40:22:10
不明
That's what we're going to do. First party data. More data, more data, more data. Very important to us. Data quality. Again, all the things that we're focusing on. Because the more that we can know, the more we're going to be able to personalize, the more we're going to be able to get, back to that desire.

00:40:22:13 - 00:40:45:07
不明
One individual, you come to the site, you see something that you want to see and someone else see something different. So, integration into workflows, we're a big, work front so that a lot of that's going into their, into our workflows, we're making sure that it's all part of it. Again, if things are established and you're getting AI in there, have it part of all those different processes, right?

00:40:45:07 - 00:41:01:33
不明
It's just important. One of the things from a personalization, maybe testing perspective that I always say is this is not Joaquin's program, and I really mean it. This is the company's program. If you go in there and you're saying whatever your name is, we'll say, Matt, for instance, sorry, Matt, if you're in here, Matt says, this is my program.

00:41:01:33 - 00:41:18:10
不明
It's going to fail. It has to be about the everyone involved. You saw how many people are involved. And so as long as you have everyone involved in the process, they becomes their program. They get excited by weekly meetings. However you want to do it. I do bi weekly meetings. They're great. Okay. And then don't be afraid to challenge current processes again.

00:41:18:10 - 00:41:33:04
不明
Be smart about it. You know, I wouldn't walk in and say, CEO, you're dumb. I wouldn't do that route. But, you know, challenge the processes, talk about how we can be better. I mean, that's that's what we're always trying to do. So, okay, I think I'm going to pass it off and then we'll have one more. Oh, no, I'm on this one.

00:41:33:05 - 00:41:48:41
不明
This is me. Yeah. It's you. Okay. From the auto targeting perspective, this is what I was talking about. So we have a page. We're working with the broken team as one part. Got a shout out already? He didn't get his last name. Now you know. So look him up. We're working with that team to, He was actually supposed to heckle us.

00:41:48:41 - 00:42:10:45
不明
He has not done any. You have, by the way. You promised heckle. You didn't heckle one from us to heckle has been way. Oh, he's been to the apologize. Apologize? All right. It's still coming. So. So basically, we're having this conversation. How do we want to utilize the auto target auto personalization part of the site? Right. So you can you can do thing you can do you can do all this or you can just do some of it, you know, move content up.

00:42:10:49 - 00:42:29:38
不明
We can, create new content using AI or not using AI. Change the CTAs, you know, utilize all the different pieces we have. In our case, we're going to we're going to focus on, a couple areas and then just let the tool go in and put the best thing for our clients. Of course, we're going to watch that.

00:42:29:52 - 00:42:45:28
不明
We're going to see to make sure it doesn't, you know, show you something you shouldn't see. But this is where our use case, because we have this, welcome back page, which is not everyone, but it's a page. It's supposed to help you to engage further. And we want we want more engagement. So that's why we're going to we're going to try out the auto targeting and see how it works for us.

00:42:45:28 - 00:43:01:33
不明
So I wasn't just telling you to do that because we're going to do it too. All right I'm going to pass it off. Thank you guys for listening. All right. Yeah. All right, I'm back. Everybody way to go. Great job working I love the applause. Thank you man you guys are nice and awake. I am here for it.

00:43:01:33 - 00:43:25:24
不明
Yeah. All right. So taking this back to your company again, wherever you are in your AI journey, completely uncomfortable. A little bit more pioneer ish, I'll call it, because I still feel now like it's new, especially with the Agen tech piece. These are the questions that you need to ask yourself. How comfortable is your organization with AI today?

00:43:25:37 - 00:43:47:53
不明
If you're doing some things with tools and practices, that's awesome. That's great. But also what are your goals? And probably that's probably the first question I mentioned earlier talking about the problems that you have. Don't worry about the like the product yet worry about the problems and then think about how I can solve them. Also, where does I fit in your personalization program?

00:43:47:58 - 00:44:07:19
不明
We started small. We are continuing to do more, but the content piece was a big blocker for us, which is why we had to test out different tools. And also, drew, don't don't give me a side eye, but Adobe generate variations is not the only tool that we use. We also use writer as well. And we have tested out Jasper.

00:44:07:19 - 00:44:25:22
不明
Those are two content generation tools that we're currently using. In addition, start small. I'll say it again. I don't know how many times I've said it, but pick one campaign, pick one email, pick one landing page, start small to prove it out or do several to. You can do that if you have the bandwidth and you have a team to assign.

00:44:25:22 - 00:44:48:45
不明
But again, keep all of those stakeholders involved and make sure that everyone has their role. And it's very clear to them. And I probably could spend a whole ton of time talking about being your own PR company. So after you have the win, you need to market said win. Okay, that could be on your internet site. That could be sending an email to executive leaders, that could be, you know, putting it out.

00:44:48:45 - 00:45:14:26
不明
Adobe Summit. What's up? All of those things are really important. So when you do have the win, it really helps grow and snowball in the best way. And then I also personally take it upon myself to recognize those that are thriving with AI. If you're using one of my products and you're excelling at it, or you found an innovative way to use it, I will publicly recognize you whether you like it or not.

00:45:14:31 - 00:45:35:44
不明
And I will also give you some recognition points with our recognition program. People love that stuff, and you want to celebrate the people that are winning with it and doing a great job. The whole reason why I do what I do is to help marketers thrive with AI. And so when it comes to the users themselves, I am deeply focused on that in solving their problems.

00:45:35:49 - 00:45:45:24
不明
And now, hopefully you are to. So go be unicorns everyone. Thank you so much.

00:45:45:28 - 00:45:45:57
不明
For.
