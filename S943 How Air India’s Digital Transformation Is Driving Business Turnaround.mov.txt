00:00:01:13 - 00:00:28:31

Glad to see all of you here really early in the morning. Bright, bright and sunny. Quickly try to understand, how many of you are from the airlines? Any other airline? Okay. Thank you. And how many of you are, marketers versus the technology team? How many marketers here? Okay, great. Thank you. I am Satya Ramasamy.

00:00:28:42 - 00:00:55:01
不明
I am the chief digital and technology officer of Air India. So, yeah. So Air India, US, many of you would know, is India's, national flag carrier. We have a very long history. I will touch upon a little bit about that. Today we are, a joint venture between the Tata sons, one of the most admired business groups in India and Singapore International Airlines.

00:00:55:03 - 00:01:20:55
不明
So Tata Sons holds about 74.9% and Singapore holds about 25.1%. And, within the Air India, when we started this whole journey, we will touch upon the whole transformation journey that we went through. We created, this organization called the Digital and Technology Organization. So myself and my colleagues here we are from the digital and technology Organization.

00:01:21:00 - 00:01:51:38
不明
We consciously set it up not as an I.T. organization. It's a version of our chairman that it has to be fundamentally different. And he has seen, companies across the world, across many, many industries. So the team has strong domain knowledge, right? So they are very strong in the airline domain. And also we are technologists. So this is a little bit different than the traditional, I.T organizations and companies.

00:01:51:43 - 00:02:22:39
不明
So talking about about Air India. Air India has a long, history. Starting with, 1932 and just recently, we have we are going through a very massive transformation. And The Economist magazine called it the Everest of corporate turnarounds. Right. So given the enormity of the task on hand and what we are going through, I think it is very apt, having lived through this for the last three years of this transformation.

00:02:22:53 - 00:02:45:47
不明
I can say that it is the Everest of, corporate turnarounds. And I operate between Silicon Valley and Delhi, about 5050. I live in the Valley, and I work out of Delhi for 40% of the time. And we have a great service, between Delhi and San Francisco and Air India nonstop within 14, 15 hours. You reach Delhi from here.

00:02:45:52 - 00:03:11:49
不明
And that allows me to practically do my law right, moving back and forth. And, the last three years have been very hectic. And again, I can completely, understand why economist at all, this transformation is the opposite of corporate turnarounds. So in terms of the new year, India, if you want to look at some numbers, we have about 300 aircraft out of which about 67 are wide body and the remaining are narrowbody aircraft.

00:03:11:54 - 00:03:43:09
不明
And there are about 103 destinations that we serve ourselves. And then a whole bunch another 800 or so destinations. So through 109 codeshare agreements. So right now we have a loyalty base of about 11 million. And, we have about 30,000 employees, you know, largely in India, but around the world as well. And, you might have also heard that India is today the fastest growing aviation market in the world, with an expected kegger of 12%, approximately for the next five years or so.

00:03:43:13 - 00:04:08:06
不明
So that is a context that where we are and as you can see from the current aircraft, fleet as well as the new aircraft fleet, and obviously with hundreds of more options, we expect that, when we are fully built out, we will be of the size of one of the major, North American carriers. Right? So the big three in North America, that is the size that we expect to be.

00:04:08:11 - 00:04:31:52
不明
And, while we embarked on the digital transformation, we had very clear goals, the business goals that we want to accomplish, in many areas. Right. So clearly focusing on customer experience. So both on the cyber space, the digital space that, you know, we are all, spearheading on the ground, in the airports and our contact centers and so on.

00:04:31:57 - 00:04:56:04
不明
And while in the. Yeah, right. So customer experience, we wanted to have a fundamental transformation and obviously operational efficiency, both in terms of the crew operations, the aircraft operations, the entire engineering operations completely transform and then the employee experience, you know, largely driven by the digital capabilities and, the improvement in our capabilities and revenue excellence. Right. So we wanted to do two things.

00:04:56:04 - 00:05:23:09
不明
One is clearly increasing the overall revenue. And the second one is to increase the share of direct channels. So those are the two primary business goals for all our digital initiatives. So overall, we laid about 170 plus digital systems from the ground up. So when we took over the airline in 2022, practically none of this was existing. So in the last three years, we have laid down about 170 different systems in the digital space, and they span all the areas of the airline.

00:05:23:11 - 00:05:45:36
不明
So from commercial to operations, engineering, finance, that's our customer experience and very importantly the enterprise on digital channel. So our focus will primarily be on the enterprise and digital channels today. But there is a huge transformation that has gone on in other areas as well. So the partnership with Adobe actually touches upon three important areas. Clearly it touches upon customer experience.

00:05:45:41 - 00:06:13:30
不明
And and obviously the revenue excellence now driving customer experience, driving revenue. Excellent. But also the employee experience. So we took the view that, all the channels that our employees use, whether it is our employee portal or the employee mobile app, and in fact, we even use Adobe targeted campaign to drive, campaigns towards the employees. So the entire suite of products that we are used for, our customers, we are also using for the employees.

00:06:13:30 - 00:06:34:26
不明
Right. And it was great to see Adobe support us in, doing that. And, our digital approach, if you take a look at it, what are we aiming to do? So we want to be very customer obsessed. So always looking at it from the point of view of the customer. And we want to be very mobile friendly.

00:06:34:26 - 00:06:51:34
不明
So clearly in the airline domain there are many applications which cannot be mobile, which are actually bus bound. So we focus on that. But we are very mobile friendly organization and we are a cloud only organization. So we do not have a data center. So in fact, Air India had very historic data centers when the first two mainframes came to India.

00:06:51:39 - 00:07:13:25
不明
That was given to Air India was there in the data center. But, somewhere in 2023, we eliminated all the data centers. So we are all on the cloud today, and we want to be very design rich organization. So anything that we do is very esthetic, very beautiful. You know, if you take a look at our mobile app, which is 4.8 in the App Store, it's a beautifully designed app and we want to be very data driven.

00:07:13:30 - 00:07:31:39
不明
So we have done a very strong data driven culture within, within our India, especially the commercial and customer experience are really the cutting edge, I think, worldwide in terms of the use of data to drive their business. And we want to be naturally in a infused organization. Right? So in fact, we used to joke that we had originally a Air India.

00:07:31:39 - 00:07:54:55
不明
Right? So so we have taken a lot of, sites and making us an emphasis organization, and we will see a couple of examples of that. So overall it is digital plus domain like we talked about and design important components of what we do. And then importantly it's about transformation or disruptions. So there are other airlines being built in the world from ground up.

00:07:55:00 - 00:08:15:38
不明
There is nothing. They are building a new airline. So we have to do the same thing with running airline. Right. So we cannot afford to disrupt one flight. So this entire transformation 170 systems being layered and so on, we did it without, disrupting anything while the operations of going on. So which we believe is something that is very unique and interesting.

00:08:15:43 - 00:08:38:36
不明
And if you look at the channel transformation itself, We have about, six main channels. We have. So starting with the mobile app, which is our flagship digital channel. So we put a lot of emphasis on making the app as good as it can be. So it is it has got won several awards. It is 4.8 in the App Store.

00:08:38:38 - 00:09:01:46
不明
You know what? What am I slow down. It is still we are improving that. And obviously the web is a very important component of our our channel strategy and it is a very important source of our direct channel revenue and the general support that we have. Call a dot g. And I named it a dot because it stands for both the R&D as well as AI.

00:09:01:51 - 00:09:23:24
不明
And G is the Indian salutation for both male and female. And it's also G stands for generative AI. So we call it a G. It is. The global airline industry is very first generator bot. We launched it in May of 2023. So, you know almost about two years we have done with with AJ pretty spectacular performance for us.

00:09:23:29 - 00:09:51:58
不明
So it has answered about 8 million queries so far. And you know, the answer is about 30,000 calls a day. And it has a phenomenal cost aspect. So the cost of a query in a G is 100th of the cost to the call center, which is, you know, pretty amazing. And, it has got a containment ratio of 97%, which means that 97% of the queries that AJ gets, it is able to answer autonomously without any human intervention.

00:09:52:03 - 00:10:10:09
不明
It escalates only 3% of the queries to the human agent. Right. So that is how it has gotten good at. And, we are surrounded the coral, along with a lot of our own homegrown innovations to avoid the typical pitfalls of the alarms and so on, such as hallucinations, safety and all that. So we are taking care. And that is the G.

00:10:10:13 - 00:10:41:51
不明
And the IFC, the in-flight entertainment, you know, the current in-flight entertainment systems, you know, are not really that great, but we are working on a brand new in-flight entertainment system, which we hope to launch in April. And that will be pretty revolutionary, right? In terms of the capabilities that it it brings about. And finally, obviously, the notifications, we saw about, two crore, notifications a month and very important component of, informing our customers, and keeping them updated.

00:10:41:56 - 00:11:24:01
不明
So those are the channels and what are we accomplished over the last three years of this journey? Our capacity again has increased, for x, so an organization that was managing 70 aircraft fleet. Now we manage about 300 aircraft and growing, and our market share went from single digits to about 30%. And, the yield of the, the airline, you know, about 40% more revenue per seat we are able to generate, after all the transformation, including the digital transformation we will be talking about, and a lot of it is driven by the inherent ability to target and segment our customers and market to them effectively convey your value proposition, but is

00:11:24:01 - 00:11:48:52
不明
also through increasingly ancillary revenue sales, which has increased by 4.5 times from where we started. And and the NPS is very important. So we have very, very detailed NPS, program, which is one of the first thing that we put on when we started, it was obviously not that great, but really, you know, a lot of difficulties we went through, but today it is dramatically increasing.

00:11:48:57 - 00:12:13:12
不明
And so today the in many of our flights, especially the new Airbus A350 900 fleet, running from Delhi to Newark, New York and London, it is, you know, 50 more. Right. So which is, which is very, interesting and good for us. And, also when we brought to our Vistara, we talked about the merger of Eastern Air India.

00:12:13:17 - 00:12:37:03
不明
Once they came on board, the, the revenue, the directional revenue of Vistara increased by 40% once you brought it to the newly reimagined channels that we had developed with the help of Adobe. And, if you ask why we chose Adobe, a lot of reasons. Right. So we obviously had a number of choices that we could we could have taken.

00:12:37:08 - 00:13:14:03
不明
And, my, direction to the team was, that well integrated whole is better than best reports, right? And if you ask me, Adobe France, they will say we are best of it. Also, you know, you know, giving that, what we very much wanted was a well integrated bunch of systems in the more marketing technology space and the content management space and also the, the creative space and, and but Adobe brought something more than that, you know, so they brought a very strong passion for India and its transformation.

00:13:14:07 - 00:13:33:28
不明
So we have glad to have over here who heads, the India business for Adobe. And she and our team are really passionate about about their India. So in many meetings, you know, I find it difficult to identify the India person from the Adobe person. They have that passionate. And many times, you know, I also was, customer of Vistara.

00:13:33:28 - 00:13:54:18
不明
So she had a personal stake in making sure that the Vistara, the merger went through smoothly. And, that was reflected in the team. Also, they they came through with such a tremendous force and passion to make the merger such a smooth experience that it eventually became. And clearly, we all know that, Adobe has the hunger for innovation, and they're constantly giving us new capabilities and also deep industry expertise.

00:13:54:18 - 00:14:32:13
不明
Right. So clearly Adobe has a very strong presence in the airline industry, as many of you from the airline industry would know. And the partnership with Amadeus, who is our, who's who are our, reservation and inventory ticketing, the business partner. So I think the partnership between Adobe and, and Amadeus was very important for us, and which is the seamless integration between Adobe and many other components of the system that, the landscape that we have to work with and obviously, the end to end suite of solutions, like they talked about for us, the well integrated whole covering the entire spectrum of, marketing and content and creative capabilities was very important.

00:14:32:13 - 00:14:55:21
不明
And Adobe was able to do that. And also the executive, sponsorship, from Adobe was very important, starting with CEO, Shantanu, he was kind enough to spend, almost an hour with me in the early days, along with whatever, talking about thing. And he pushed us hard to look at the business outcome of what we do, rather than just purely for the technology part of it.

00:14:55:26 - 00:15:20:47
不明
And clearly, Anil and Stephan and, Schrader from the engineering team and obviously Pratibha herself, being there, it has been a tremendous source of strength for us, symptoms of, doing this transformation. And what do we, what are the products that we have from Adobe? So we we have the full suite of Adobe products, from target to a, the analytics is very important component.

00:15:20:47 - 00:15:41:11
不明
The journey analyzer, or PC review is very critical, because the need for us to drive personalized outcomes and the the ability to drive yields and ancillary sales through personalization and obviously Adobe Campaign are not front. Right. So we have taken the whole suite of Adobe products. And on top of it, Adobe Professional Services has been a huge real strength for us.

00:15:41:20 - 00:16:12:26
不明
So, you know, they really have played a tremendous role in the whole transformation. And with that, I will request my colleague, there are Joseph here. So, so clearly Adobe has done a lot to improve the the image of Air India. But clearly Adobe Photoshop has done a lot to improve the image of. So this is.

00:16:12:31 - 00:16:42:43
不明
Yeah, I was expecting that. Thank you. Satya but but yeah. So they were Joseph and the VP for consumer technologies and as, any like, person would say, I reserve the right to complain about the technology in it. I'll start with it. So one of the biggest challenges that we faced when we kind of, when we moved into Air India, been with Tata Group now for 25 years and, based on the call, group transfers way more than, two and a half years back.

00:16:42:48 - 00:16:59:31
不明
And, we took a look at the code. It was over a 20 year old. Right. The stack, I think, the probably the same fact that I kind of started my career with, code was very, very old. We actually found the deployment, the production. Deployment actually had learned dot net books out there, right? So.

00:16:59:36 - 00:17:17:56
不明
And nobody was looking at the code. The data was all siloed. What what data that we had. And interestingly, I think, of all the global airlines, India's site was only one which probably did not have privacy warning because pretty much it was not collecting data. There was no deal out there. So there was no warning data as well.

00:17:17:56 - 00:17:49:39
不明
It was hosted at the government data center. And obviously once the government, realized that, they no longer had to do it, we are under pressure to move out of there at the no time, security standard, listed the beta. The mobile app was, it's a weekly build up, but, that meant that it was difficult for us to bring additional capabilities at the pace at which we wanted to do, and anytime we want to make a change on the website, because the code complexities, if you will, get to one function.

00:17:49:44 - 00:18:07:40
不明
I remember we printed it out and I think the printer ran out of paper. So that's how complex it was. And there was no documentation at all. So it was a very, very interesting, somebody 20 years back had figured out, they wanted to try and experiment with the, homegrown content management, and that's what the NDA was using.

00:18:07:40 - 00:18:25:42
不明
Again, no documentation. No, no. Could be it. Which made it very difficult for us to add the content. In there, the user experience was pretty much broken across multiple platforms. So if you googled for chicken, you probably see three links. One would have been created on 1012 years back, another one would have been seven years back. And some rules change.

00:18:25:42 - 00:18:42:48
不明
But guess what? Nobody removed the old one and the third one. And when someone complained, hey, chicken is not working, it, we struggled to figure out which chicken was not working. Where was it not working? The mobile web experience was non-existent and that was very important for us being airline people try to chicken on the we don't.

00:18:42:48 - 00:19:04:48
不明
So that, you essentially the only thing that we could ask people was to move the phone into landscape mode, which would mean sometimes, not always, but time. There was almost like I said, there was no more or there was no possibility for, personalization. And, like, I said, there's no customer tracking as well.

00:19:04:53 - 00:19:31:31
不明
So but again, the pressure was on us, because, when the group took over, the group has a strong legacy in adopting technology, being forefront in adopting technology. Like Doctor Sethi, IT chairman, had set up a very strong, expectation on us to ensure that, we become world, short of space. So we wanted to turn around quite fast.

00:19:31:31 - 00:20:03:07
不明
We wanted a platform that can scale very well, because we knew that there was a large ambition for the group to grow into something very, very vast and really special. And like doctor said, everything had to be cloud based. And, we wanted a very consistent experience across all the channels because, again, the expectation from a technology perspective and, our user research also indicated that most of our customers are primarily on the mobile, in fact, mobile web actually, had around 5 to 8 times the usage as compared to the actual website or the mobile app.

00:20:03:07 - 00:20:22:08
不明
Mobile app was, I think, at that point of time, less than 1%. The usage of mobile app as well. And we obviously knew that our, fleet and inventory was going to grow quite well, and hence we wanted to ensure we laid down the right foundation. So the most interesting and most pressing thing was to turnaround quite fast.

00:20:22:08 - 00:20:40:44
不明
And, we did reach out to understand a bit more on how that would take. We did reach out to some of our airline friends, and they gave us a guidance that typically, airline website takes 18 to 24 months for end to end development. And, the good thing was that, our friends at Adobe or none of us were actually from airline background.

00:20:40:44 - 00:21:06:33
不明
So we really did not believe that. And, we said, with our friends in Adobe and then came out with a strategy on how do we adopt, an end to end journey, which can be developed at a very, very fast pace. Right. So we looked at every single phase of the customer journey, understood what the customer would need and what we would need to learn about the customer to offer a personalized experience.

00:21:06:37 - 00:21:40:50
不明
How do you make it completely omnichannel? We looked at what are the tools which can actually support that. And look at the website. We probably had the entire stack deployed there. Same with the mobile as well. And we notification so that any experience that you get in one channel can be easily replicated across the other and sold through and by personalization segment of one where we understand the customer's one advantage we be an airline is that we know our customers quite well because they give the details of what they who they, what they do, and which means that we can actually personalize absolutely, positively personalized experience.

00:21:40:55 - 00:22:09:29
不明
So we sat with a friend from Adobe. A lot of them are here in this room as well. Very, very interesting discussions on how do we kind of, build this at a very strong and very fast pace? We wanted to set up a vision and, understand what we do currently have, come up with an overall strategy which would scale from a marketing perspective, from personalization perspective, offering personalized journey, targeting.

00:22:09:34 - 00:22:30:03
不明
And we also want to ensure that we have the right integration at every single point of the journey. And we also want to set up a model where we can actually continuously, continually improve, even if we, even have to view the entire site. Right. So the result was we were able to build an entire website with brand new content.

00:22:30:03 - 00:22:48:16
不明
Nothing was reused, along with a lot of support from our friends at Amadeus. For the transaction screens, we are able to build a brand new website with a completely new branding concept. Every single word was written. We didn't host the same team. We had in-house content team. We actually kind of went through how we wanted to position it.

00:22:48:21 - 00:22:58:03
不明
And using a, we were able to deploy it in three and a half months, which I believe the fastest, putting everything.

00:22:58:08 - 00:23:20:09
不明
And this is the result that we got. Right. This was like, just over a couple of years back. And, the website was it has increased to around four times the number of orders also proportionally has increased, and, a sizable increase in the unique visitors. My colleague will talk a bit more about, or the conversion rate.

00:23:20:09 - 00:23:48:55
不明
We believe it's, one of the highest in the industry. Thanks for the entire journey that's been concocted. And, we actually provide a personalized experience for a large, 75% of our users who actually visit, our website. And, our, direct share revenue actually increased by, again, 2.5 times after we build a platform, which is just a testament that, I mean, at least the customers were coming to our site rather than other sites to book.

00:23:48:55 - 00:24:09:49
不明
More and more customers were actually coming there. And like Doctor Satya said, we have a rating of 4.8 on both App Store and Play Store on our mobile app, which again was built, in record time of three months. Right. Completely native mobile app for both iOS and Android. With a great experience. We just won a bunch of awards as well.

00:24:09:54 - 00:24:13:45
不明
Yes.

00:24:13:49 - 00:24:28:14
不明
So I'll hand it over to my colleague Jay Prakash, who will talk a bit more about the nuts and bolts which, went behind the transformation.

00:24:28:19 - 00:24:32:13
不明
So morning everyone.

00:24:32:18 - 00:24:57:33
不明
So basically, I just thought of touching up the website side of things because, we started with the website, so, we started with the custom content management system. So it is called content management system. But it was very, very practical. It was, there is no way to manage the content. Okay. It was more like, okay, you can create some something with that.

00:24:57:37 - 00:25:18:42
不明
So we want the scale because the, the kind of vision and the roadmap, actually set by, as your doctor said there. So we wanted a, we wanted the scale of, we wanted a reliable, content management system with this. So that is how we have actually kind of gone to, aim, as our content management system.

00:25:18:46 - 00:25:54:07
不明
So the scale is very important for us because we have actually kind of more or less during the Vistara merger. So what happened was during within one hour, the traffic actually kind of scaled up to 30 percentage. Okay. So whatever we had 30%, it suddenly kind of got spiked. And the systems Adobe Systems scaled up beautifully. Okay. So from four parts and it actually scaled up to 187 parts and without given without any kind of disruption, no service disruption, nothing.

00:25:54:12 - 00:26:19:19
不明
Okay. So also we wanted to make sure that we kind of reduce the, the page development, efforts because earlier it was like 3 or 5 days, 3 to 5 days actually took just to create one page. So we wanted to cut it down. So from a practical point of view, we wanted to make sure that our orders are actually creating pages in a much faster pace.

00:26:19:24 - 00:26:46:37
不明
So what we did was we have actually set up an enterprise design system, starting from the design. Then based on that design system, we have actually created an enterprise component library. So it actually cut across website, mobile application or any other application across different technologies. So the intention was to build. So ultimately it is UI controls. So you have infinite number of UI controls.

00:26:46:37 - 00:27:08:10
不明
So you can create any number of composite components with that. So at some point of time you will reach a point where you will be it is just plug and play. So we wanted to kind of cut down the page build time okay. So we have kind of achieved almost like a 50 to 80 percentage of the time, kind of reduced.

00:27:08:15 - 00:27:37:40
不明
And from a content point of view, I'll just touch upon the content side of things. What is content for us? Okay. Because we are targeting the omnichannel application. So for now, for us, the content is very, very important. So I'll just to, talk about the content in a separate, slide. So, from an architecture point of view, I am just a tech guy, so I just touch upon, the architecture.

00:27:37:51 - 00:28:02:16
不明
So where we wanted to and what exactly we were actually targeting. So it's all actually kind of started with this key. Okay. And, we have, completely invested in microservices. So we started with the and the completely 100 percentage of our, APIs. It's a completely a bit driven system. So we, are kind of API first organization.

00:28:02:25 - 00:28:36:34
不明
So we think about APIs as a product. So we are invested very heavily in the microservices and cloud native. And we are APIs are mostly into Azure system. So do so we do have presence in AWS and Google. It is more or less like, almost like 99.99%, which is at Azure level itself. Okay. And we have given, importance to the automation side of things because we want to cut down anything that will kind of end up in error.

00:28:36:39 - 00:29:00:05
不明
Okay. So we try to kind of automate all the pipelines and everything. We try to automate it. We hooked up all the quality controls and everything, security, scanning everything into our release pipelines so that we don't have to kind of worry about all these things because no, humans are actually involved in that. Automatically you commit something, so something will happen automatically.

00:29:00:12 - 00:29:22:21
不明
So everything is actually going, in an automated way. So this actually kind of happened not in the night. It kind of happened progressively, in the last two, two and half years. So, I think we have set up very high standards. So still, there are things that we wanted to achieve and, it is mobile. First everything.

00:29:22:21 - 00:29:54:10
不明
It's all out, mobile first. We got 70 percentage average, 70 percentage of our customers are actually coming through mobile devices. I am not talking about the tablets. The real phones. Okay. But we wanted to provide the the experience. So which kind of, components kind of helped us that, PR responsive web design helped us to reach. And we have also kind of invested very heavily in the native, the mobile applications, if you take a look at it, it is all native applications.

00:29:54:19 - 00:30:22:57
不明
You won't find, the views there much so it's a complete of Android, Kotlin, etc. it is completely based item. And during the initial phase itself, we try to set up a data layer which actually cut across the enterprise. So within I mean across all the applications. So we pulled the data from many data sources, including Amadeus.

00:30:23:04 - 00:30:56:17
不明
We are pulling the data from Amadeus. We are pulling the data from Salesforce. We are pulling the data from a lot of internal systems. But ultimately what we are actually going to do with all this data. So we are kind of generating insights. So the personalization piece is actually going to be talked by my colleague later. So all these data we are actually kind of taking this data and making some insights out of this based on which we will kind of do certain kind of personalization and certain kind of targeting with that.

00:30:56:22 - 00:31:01:50
不明
Okay. So.

00:31:01:55 - 00:31:27:13
不明
Just for your just I thought like, putting an architecture what we have right now. So everything is actually started. So whatever whenever whoever actually touches Air India. So it all goes to Akamai. So that is our Korean partner. And all the security controls, bot protection, DDoS and all those virus and everything is actually kind of set up at the, Akamai level itself.

00:31:27:18 - 00:31:51:47
不明
So from there it actually travels to a, it travels to our microservices layer. So we have application microservices. So each application is mobile applications website, I have chat bot, they all have their own microservices. And it actually kind of touches that microservices layer. And there is one important aspect in this particular diagram. So that is SkyBridge.

00:31:51:52 - 00:32:16:06
不明
So Amadeus is our very important partner. So all the key airline operations are being done through Amadeus. So we do not want to take any kind of chance. So we have a very dedicated layer for that communication cloud which actually handles everything. All the communication with Amadeus is actually going through that skybridge. And we do have the data layer.

00:32:16:21 - 00:32:44:49
不明
So it is purely based on the data bricks. And we are kind of interesting the data we are creating a lot of insights out of the data and a lot of third party integrations, payment weather and all those Salesforce and a lot of, lot of, third party integrations. We have so this is how, it is and the we are extracting the entire customer journey through Adobe Analytics.

00:32:44:54 - 00:33:11:33
不明
There is a user behavior analytics. Also, we are using Hotjar at the moment. So we try to understand what exactly the user is actually doing with the features that we roll out. Okay. We wanted to understand the effectiveness of all these features. So we tend to kind of analyze that as well. And based on that we take decisions.

00:33:11:38 - 00:33:43:48
不明
So content I am going back to the original thing. What is content for us. Because from our perspective, content is very important. And we want to call it as content, as a service where we want it to push content into our omnichannel applications as a commodity. So whoever, because earlier the content was tightly coupled with the application code and if you want to make any kind of changes in the content, you have to kind of roll up, you have to deploy another version.

00:33:43:53 - 00:34:14:51
不明
And it was not practical for us. So we wanted to make sure that M is actually working as a content hub. So we have actually kind of exposed APIs and kind of completely our omnichannel applications, website, mobile, AIG, everything actually, all these applications started pulling the content. Based on their requirement through E. So it is just ordering all the content fragments and whatever it is exposed through the GraphQL.

00:34:14:51 - 00:34:56:51
不明
Then Rest APIs and everything has actually been, kind of consumed by our application. So just before completing it, I thought, like, testing about the performance. I'm not talking about the marketing performance. It is the page rendering performance, which is a critical, aspect as far as the SEO is concerned. Now, whenever you talk about the front end performance or the page rendering performance, you will kind of face a lot of challenges with the media, the, the, the media performance, because the tech guy will kind of optimize the image in such a way that it will become blurry, okay.

00:34:56:51 - 00:35:28:00
不明
The quality will be lost. So we we have been actually kind of we have been, researching on this particular, area, how can we achieve the true performance? Okay. So we thought like we had multiple rounds of discussion with, Adobe. So they have actually introduced us to, something called dynamic Media, where it's it's a kind of self-service kind of a thing where you will be able to optimize your images on the run.

00:35:28:04 - 00:36:03:00
不明
So based on the device aspects, based on the network conditions, the images will be optimized on the run. And that was like without losing much of a quality. And that is is something which we were or rather we been actually looking for. Okay. Until it kind of helped us to kind of, cut down, almost like, 55 to 60 percentage of our, client bandwidth because it was more or less it was eating up the big images were eating up our, client bandwidth.

00:36:03:10 - 00:36:24:43
不明
And, this actually kind of very much helped us to, reduce our bandwidth, consumption. So I like to call her frame my colleague. So we will actually go deeper into the into the metrics side of things. Yeah. Thank you. JP.

00:36:24:48 - 00:36:54:30
不明
Yeah. Coming to the martech separate, doctor said they had, given us a very clear vision and, strategy on how we should set up and for the right products in place, right process in place and so on. So, like, what we mentioned earlier, right? I mean, Marty goes non-existent in our previous world. So when we took over, we started, setting up everything from scratch, thanks to the Arab team, who helped us first initially set up the whole stack, the right architecture.

00:36:54:30 - 00:37:14:04
不明
Right. The things in place. We initially started with everything analytics. We wanted to know anything and everything about what is being set up. And then, all the GDPR compliances, all the consent that we need to collect and so on. And when we do all these things, we cannot stop campaigns and so on. Right? So at this period, it was all done manually.

00:37:14:09 - 00:37:35:27
不明
And when we got all the, segments and everything on or everything connected or, won trust, consent collected and so on and so forth, now we have come to a place where and it's, it's all automated. So we have a calendar and then it just runs. I can sit here and do everything consent. So that's the thing that we have reached, just like what you mentioned, right?

00:37:35:27 - 00:37:57:46
不明
I mean, when we start a merger happen just seamlessly. This worked. Yeah. So that's that's how we are right now. So it's about right now we track anything, everything about booking journey, everything that's there. Thanks to our, colleagues at Amadeus. Right? I mean, they had done the survey, and they found. So in our industry, conversion rate is the biggest isn't.

00:37:57:46 - 00:38:22:18
不明
So when you get the users, you come into one of our channels how to reach to them. Right. So, industry standard is about, to 2 to 5, sorry, 5 to 7% and so on. And with this we have achieved a 7.9 as we speak today for, generic unknown user, that is a, whom we have not much of a profile data and so on.

00:38:22:22 - 00:38:47:53
不明
And for the profile whom we know the loyalty, we have doubled it. So it's around 14%. So that's the conversion rate that we have got it. This cannot be achieved with the one change that is a it is multiple changes. Multiple changes. It's like we need to use a target to do an urgency time. There you need to do abandoned cart with the campaign that needs to go off with the person.

00:38:47:58 - 00:39:06:55
不明
Moves out of the flow. Booking flow. We need to do, like highlighting. Not just right. To win the seat is the best selling seat is another thing that we have introduced. Taking the analytics, doing a runtime, of, data and analysis from who booking which seat and then nudging that seat and so on, so forth.

00:39:06:55 - 00:39:27:11
不明
Right. So on the back end, we have, like what we mentioned, we have got, 18 million, user profiles that are there. And we are enriching. We are creating segments. The segments are like, yeah, as we speak, like 140 plus, but it will keep going up and down because, and it is a segment that is not work.

00:39:27:16 - 00:39:59:08
不明
We will shut it down. Anything new, we will start adding and so on. So everything is right now automation. 250 plus, templates are being created either in the web or in the, emails and templates and so on. This, this allows us to actually have a unified, messaging across all the channels, whether it is a WhatsApp message that is being sent with the email marketing or a webpage nudge that is there, and it it is not a blaster.

00:39:59:09 - 00:40:20:40
不明
You don't send it to every segment, every time. It is only to the right segment, to the right people, to the right time, and so on. Right? So this is possible because it a unified it's across the channels and so on. And it is not only inside that we do once these segments are inside the, our Adobe Suit of Communication.

00:40:20:40 - 00:40:43:15
不明
And we also push this to or, paid channels that are there outside of Meta and Google and so on. And we have reached 85 to 90% match rates. So that's really, really high. Yeah. So in terms of how we are able to reach the, end user and, get the payment, the payment. So, so the paid campaigns working, this is also.

00:40:43:15 - 00:41:07:21
不明
Yeah. So this is mainly powered like what GPUs mentioned. Right. This is mainly powered by the, backend, a that we have structured the content. It is all automated. It's template driven. It's, everything, everything in terms of, funnel conversion or the campaigns and so on. Everything is, templated and automated as of as what to speak right now.

00:41:07:28 - 00:41:15:58
不明
So with this I will hand it over back to. But Sophia. So thank you. Thank you. Prime.

00:41:16:03 - 00:41:36:03
不明
Thank you Prem JP and, and and, before we conclude, I just want to talk about, one more thing. So we have quite a bit of experience in journey and what I'm glad to share with our other friends and others. And, we thought what it would be to transform the entire booking experience of customers.

00:41:36:03 - 00:41:54:02
不明
Right. So today a customer comes to your website, they are having the full form of the form. And then finally four five screens later they are able to complete the reservation. So our thought was how can we just cut through all this? Right. So the customer can just tell either speak or type what they want in terms of an artery.

00:41:54:07 - 00:42:13:55
不明
For example, give me a ticket from New York to Delhi, next Tuesday, returning two weeks later, and I should be able to just make the reservation just like that. Right. So that is what, we have done with what we call as easy booking. So we have used, Adobe Auto CDP, Adobe Target and Auto Analytics, and then a little bit of, to bring all these things together.

00:42:13:55 - 00:42:25:30
不明
So again, a good collaboration with Adobe to make this happen. So we are very grateful to receive the Adobe Experience Maker of the year award.

00:42:25:35 - 00:42:29:30
不明
This year.

00:42:29:34 - 00:42:50:10
不明
So thank thanks a lot to all of you for attending the call today. Glad to answer any questions either here or later. Please feel free to messages. We are more than happy to help, especially the friends from our airline industry. Thank you. And we can take any questions or.

00:42:50:15 - 00:42:51:13
不明
You.
