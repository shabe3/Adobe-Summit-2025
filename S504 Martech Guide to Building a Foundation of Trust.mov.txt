00:00:00:16 - 00:00:26:57
不明
Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. I know on the last day after bash, this is usually one of those very chill kind of experiences. So I'm Elizabeth Sexton I'm a director of product management at Adobe. I work specifically in privacy in highly regulated industries. And I am John Sperling. I work for in the US. Focus on our digital and portfolio marketing.

00:00:27:01 - 00:01:00:36
不明
Okay. All right. Get started with some of like the basics and a quick get to know. So we are a professional services firm focused on helping individual goals and organizations deliver value. We're about 350,000 people strong across 150 countries. So some of those data points are a little bit updated to date. I am one of about 300 people in the US focused on our brand in demand programs and how we most effectively bring to market, and as I mentioned, help to lead our portfolio marketing team.

00:01:00:50 - 00:01:27:32
不明
I like to think about portfolio marketing as, bringing harmony across our ecosystem. People, process, tech and data and ultimately, again, focus in on that concept of brand and demand. And how do we support both and realize, the interplay between the two of them? And ultimately, I would say being an organization that is focused on delivering a lot of highly regulated services, it's critically important for us to always be anchored in on trust.

00:01:27:32 - 00:01:54:50
不明
So we are most definitely from an internal perspective, trying to find symbiosis across multiple different functions and externally. How do we become partners to someone throughout the lifecycle of their career? Right. And build that brand authority, that kind of kind of plays off of that concept of trust. So getting into our presentation today, I'd say it's like a 201 level, maybe a little bit 101, where we're going to start in with some theory and then get really into a little bit of brass tacks.

00:01:54:50 - 00:02:22:54
不明
But we thought what would be really important is to start with an anchor in on why. Why would we be talking about trust, and why would we be thinking about trust through the lens of your martech stack in some of the architecture? And how do you ultimately enable technology in the most effective and efficient ways? So if we kind of get started on the key drivers for trust, we really thought that this kind of anchors in on a couple of very specific areas.

00:02:22:55 - 00:02:49:46
不明
We know that marketing is in the midst of a significant amount of change. There's a lot of transformation happening, and there are new demands for marketing today than ever before. But when we start to get into those key drivers, really think they're focused on some of these four areas, and they'll kind of play back into kind of areas for you to focus or to think about as you go back home and you start to build out perhaps a little bit of a modified approach to your martech stack, or how do you build trust within your martech stack?

00:02:49:51 - 00:03:20:20
不明
So first, from left to right, the concept of transparent. And I think that's twofold. Right. There's the reality that legislation is changing at an incredibly quick clip. And we need to be very smart about being mindful around our data policies and practices. Furthermore, there is this need right for users to have control of their data and want to be the primary drivers of how that information is used in us as marketers, bringing that forward and giving them that choice, but not just giving them that choice, honoring that choice kind of a very key concept.

00:03:20:20 - 00:03:47:33
不明
There. Second to that, the concept of experiences, expectations, whether in B2C or B2B, are fundamentally changing. There's new channels today than there were yesterday. But the reality is experience is needs to be seamless. It needs to be frictionless. It needs to be end to end. It needs to be omnichannel. And that is something that necessitates, changing of what our legacy verticals, whether you think about those as channels or whether you think about those as internal functions to become horizontals.

00:03:47:38 - 00:04:13:15
不明
Technology is another key driver. We have a lot more technology today than ever before. The interplay between technology and how do you make them work without latency, without creating technical that is critically important, and ultimately realizing that technology is a driver of of innovation and competitiveness. And then the last kind of concept is agility. We know that legacy ways of working are no longer functioning in the same way.

00:04:13:22 - 00:04:37:54
不明
We have to look at how we break down silos internally. We have to look at how we're going ahead and keeping in mind the interplay between different technologies, different processes. And we need to be mindful about trying to be as proactive as possible so that, again, you don't create technical debt or you don't lose trust. Make sense? So if we continue on from kind of that case for change in those key drivers, we start to say like, how do we start to storyteller.

00:04:37:58 - 00:05:06:14
不明
I think something that you don't see on this slide that's critically important to keep in mind is this concept that it takes a really long time to build. Trust can take years, if you think about it in your personal relationships, takes a lot of time. On the flip side, it's very quick and easy to lose trust. So when you start to go ahead and say, well, all right, I understand some of the drivers that is necessitating for me to change my ways of working and my thinking, we can start to flip that into, all right, well, how do I talk about that to my business stakeholders to say I need to have a different approach

00:05:06:14 - 00:05:25:55
不明
to my legacy ways of working, inclusive of how I make investments and take, tech or use cases and whatnot, so we can talk talk about that through the lens. A little bit of business value. Right. We know that one of the prereqs for individuals to make purchase decisions is to go to a brand that they trust. 81% of individuals are saying that that is a prereq.

00:05:26:00 - 00:05:47:12
不明
Furthermore, if we look down at that bottom statistic, people are willing to buy and spend more with organizations that they trust. So it starts to get into this concept where if we understand that the drivers are necessitating change, we understand that trust can either be an expense or a value driver, and we know that we can turn that into quantifiable metrics.

00:05:47:16 - 00:05:55:14
不明
This concept of trust in the storytelling becomes that much easier. So if we go into our next slide.

00:05:55:19 - 00:06:34:37
不明
We turn into that element of data responsibility, right? The reality is, in both B2C and B2B cases, we are seeing that more than ever before. People are starting digital first, which means that the way in which we legacy could have paid attention to certain signals or buying, you know, hand razors has gone away. We need to be more mindful than ever before about that interplay between implicit and explicit data signals, and managing to users preferences that sometimes are, through their digital body language, to deliver experiences that are going to foster trust, that are going to help take advantage of that fact, that they're going to spend more, but more importantly, that we're managing to their

00:06:34:37 - 00:06:52:31
不明
preferences in a way that is both outward and inward. And what I mean by that is that they're willing to give us their data, in turn, that we are delivering upon the experiences that they expect him or helping them to make their purchase decisions in the most efficient and effective way possible. How do you do that? Right one.

00:06:52:33 - 00:07:17:52
不明
One way is to simply ask, right? Create an ecosystem where it's very easy for someone to opt in, for someone to opt out, for them to control the way in which we communicate with them. But then that gets back into if we're not prepared to go ahead and to honor the preferences that sometimes are very clear, right. I choose a specific subscription or a particular preference, or my digital body language is indicative of me needing some sort of other conversation.

00:07:17:52 - 00:07:40:11
不明
If we're not ready to deliver upon that, you start to maybe break that trust. So there's that element of being very clear and very prescriptive about how do I build trust, but also deliver upon that and know that interplay between the two. When we go into our next slide, we start to really just get down to this question right from that case for change.

00:07:40:12 - 00:08:04:01
不明
Ultimately, do you want to be a reactive organization or do you want to be a proactive organization? And sometimes being as maybe pointed as that question to your business stakeholders and understanding that element of brand reputation and that interplay of reputation leads to quantifiable revenue is enough of a question to talk about, well, why do we need to change the ways we are working?

00:08:04:01 - 00:08:25:04
不明
Why do we need to change our approach? Why do we need to fundamentally start with some different questions? So as we go from this area of theory into our next section, so how do we start to create trust? How do we start to build trust if we go into the next one? Yeah. We start to have a bit of a different conversation.

00:08:25:04 - 00:08:54:45
不明
So now we know the why. So it becomes a little bit of the how. Before we dive too deep, I was kind of toggling back and forth between two really anchor kind of concepts. The idea of organizational trust. Internal trust. How do we trust one another to make our go to market, to make our brand really sing? How do we trust and have confidence that it's not about who owns data or who owns technology, but rather are we speaking the same language?

00:08:54:50 - 00:09:21:18
不明
And are we going ahead and trusting what is brought forward? Right. Are we understanding some of the profiling that is helping us make decisions for how we go to market? Furthermore, from a consumer standpoint, from that external standpoint, are we going ahead and honoring what they're telling us explicitly and implicitly and making, their ability to choose their own adventure and get the right message at the right time on the right channel, even easier than ever before.

00:09:21:23 - 00:09:48:07
不明
So this next slide tries to kind of visualize that and don't necessarily pay complete attention to the words on the screen. But think about this both through the internal the external lens. If we start internally, we have lots of different functions with different goals, right, coming together that fundamentally need some sort of a filter to go ahead and coordinate those go to market initiatives and to help everybody achieve the business outcomes that we need.

00:09:48:12 - 00:10:16:40
不明
Real time CDP, as an example, is a foundational item that helps us achieve that, right. It goes ahead and unifies disparate data sets, gives us a single 360 view of a client that can become incredibly powerful, incredibly powerful, externally, it goes ahead and takes a variety of different business messages that might be in market priorities. Right? Filters them and helps us get that right message to the right person at the right time, and celebrates the uniqueness of every persona.

00:10:16:40 - 00:10:43:19
不明
It celebrates the fact that I might look to engage differently, or I might want different types of information, and it makes that easier than ever and starts to orchestrate that experience. Ultimately, it plays into the fact that it's not just a marketing decision. It's not just a tech decision. It's not just a risk decision. It's not just a business decision, but we are all in this together to ultimately help support, brand and demand.

00:10:43:24 - 00:11:02:52
不明
All right. Well, taking it to the next level, let's talk about how we start off. The reality is is growing trust. And we hear it every day. All you have to do is turn on the TV, look on your phone, and you're going to have all of these conversations about how you trust, where you trust. Trust being something that's pivotal.

00:11:03:07 - 00:11:36:42
不明
But it actually takes work. And the reality is, is it's a groundswell of effort. Probably about six years ago, we talked a lot about what is your framework for privacy, what is the things that you're going to do, especially as GDPR came on board. And yes, that's foundational. That's kind of your bedrock of where you begin is what are the privacy principles that you are really going to put into place in order to make sure you are treating consumers the way they want to be treated?

00:11:36:46 - 00:12:10:46
不明
And in the last few years, we've layered over top of that governance. This can be data governance, it can be model governance. But yet you still need to have those same principles and factors that you're going to continue to follow. And then now, as you've heard on Main Stage throughout this week, is AI governance. We talk a lot about AI, but it also is going to take the same level of effort as you've layered on that top soil to really understand where customers want to be, how you are going to maintain that person in the loop.

00:12:10:46 - 00:12:34:48
不明
So the the AI plus plus people factor. And so all of these from the bedrock up to the top soil, are really important factors as how do you even start? The reality is you can't just jump in at AI governance and then say, no big deal, we're just going to move from here because there's so many factors that underlie that.

00:12:34:53 - 00:13:03:56
不明
Then we talk about how do we grow, from there, because the reality is you're trying to grow a relationship. You're trying to create that trusted relationship both internally and externally, making sure you have the right stakeholders on your side, understanding the same message. And there's where the roots begin. Did you have that transparent engagement with the stakeholders in your organization, with the consumers that you serve?

00:13:04:01 - 00:13:30:00
不明
Are you providing a consistent experience? People love consistency, and there's no better way to create some trust than consistently interact with them in a way they told you they wanted you to interact with them. And then honest communication, not hiding anything, not trying to tell a consumer that we know how you feel. So we're going to send you this coupon or this ad.

00:13:30:05 - 00:14:02:58
不明
It's actually taking the time to understand what they want, as John was talking about where they want and on what channel these are critical decisions. And so for a brand, all of this underlies how you engage both internally and externally, whether it's with your employees and your stakeholders and the marketer versus the consumer. And so for the brand to really grow a tree, to grow their audience, they really need to understand that all of that starts with them.

00:14:03:03 - 00:14:19:22
不明
And then that's where they take it from the internal to the external. I think that this visual as a practitioner really sings. And it's this concept, if you think about a tree, right, you have the roots, you have the base, and then at the top right is where it needs to kind of sway in the way in the wind.

00:14:19:33 - 00:14:38:38
不明
Right. And it needs to be flexible. And if you think about this visual, it really plays in on the left right consumer driven and on the right marketer driven. So that push and pull kind of experiences that a marketing organization fundamentally needs to balance, right. There are things that our organizations need to have in market and that the marketer needs to drive.

00:14:38:52 - 00:14:53:58
不明
But back to that point of storing data, leveraging data, those implicit signals, you also need to be mindful of when the consumer is indicating that they want to receive something, or they need to receive something, and you want to get that point in time. So we need to find that balance of how do we shut off the noise.

00:14:53:58 - 00:15:19:01
不明
And the marketing side needs to be quiet in favor of what the consumer is telling us, while still supporting, ultimately that foundational element of brand reputation and brand authority. Great. Thank you. So at Adobe, we have several principles of trust that we've outlined as we build or bring to life the tools that we've been talking about with CDP.

00:15:19:06 - 00:15:49:16
不明
And that will continue. Well, so first and foremost is making sure that we are able to meet the needs of you, our customers, with with our services at Adobe. That means our principles of trust really need to be flexible, because your organization may have varying parts of these principles. And so we want to make sure that you can meet your needs when you are in market.

00:15:49:21 - 00:16:15:09
不明
So let's talk about how we innovate, tied to the trust principles. We want to make sure that we continue to follow all of the things that relate to consumer privacy, what the strategy is, how can we transform, interact, making sure that security is top of mind and that data hygiene, which is principles surrounding data minimization and data cleansing, are supported.

00:16:15:14 - 00:16:44:51
不明
So our innovation layer, much like the tree, our bedrock layer is the innovation pillars of regulations which support data subject rights requests, consent, which is that information that's invaluable to your your organization. As the consumer tells you, I prefer email. I want it in a push notification. Please send me that on SMS or meet me on this channel.

00:16:44:56 - 00:17:11:35
不明
Optimization is what's going to scale the business. Being able to understand how to transparently engage and how that ties back to your strategy is integral. Then we have data governance capabilities that allow you to manage the data that you need, that ties back to your strategy and make it available at the time you need it for your engagement.

00:17:11:40 - 00:17:38:13
不明
And then from a security perspective, making sure that that data is encrypted. So in the event anything or anyone is coming after that, that data is safe, that data is secure. These are critical elements to how we have to do business today. And then that last one, the data hygiene, with data lifecycle management built into our foundation, you can actually take advantage of things.

00:17:38:13 - 00:18:04:16
不明
Like I said, in my privacy notice, I would only keep your data for 36 months. So at 36 months, you need to make sure you get rid of that data. Or I contracted to get prospect data, and I need to make sure that that data set no longer exists, because I don't want to pay for more than a year, and you can set a time to live on that data set that in the future you no longer have to worry, and it just happens.

00:18:04:20 - 00:18:30:45
不明
You'll get rid of that data. And then with removing the data, you actually get a notice that it was completed. All critical pillars to how we do business at that bedrock foundational layer. So this I'm actually going to skip ahead to the next slide. This actually identifies a lot of what the services are that are built into our foundation.

00:18:30:50 - 00:18:57:16
不明
And with it being built into our foundation, that applications and services above it are able to really take advantage of it. This is not like we built an application, and now you're going to have to go out and figure out what you're going to do for data subject rights requests, what you're going to do as it relates to your encryption store, and how you're going to automatically delete either records or delete data sets.

00:18:57:21 - 00:19:25:21
不明
And for those customers who need even more capabilities within our Data Governance and Trust section, you can also layer on top things like attribute based access control, which allows you to say at that field level, yes, Elizabeth can have access to this, but John cannot because John doesn't need it for his job. It allows you to be very selective and how you use the data and bring the data to life.

00:19:25:26 - 00:19:54:54
不明
And then customer manage keys. If at any point you have concern or if any point you are like, I really need to like lock everything down and make sure that we don't have anything going anywhere we didn't expect. You can rotate your keys using customer managed keys with many of our applications. We also offer the self-service audit logs, which help you figure out what might have changed or why it changed, or who it who changed.

00:19:54:54 - 00:20:23:40
不明
It. So this gives you a glimpse of some of those, key capabilities as it relates to our offerings in Adobe real time CDP. The trust offerings are our foundational capabilities. We don't believe that if you buy our applications, that you should then have to layer on all these layers of privacy, security, data governance, or to create it in your own environment and then try to push it to Adobe.

00:20:23:45 - 00:20:58:05
不明
That's part of our foundational layer. When you buy real time CDP, those foundational pieces are already available. And if you're looking at technology that fills your needs but doesn't have these, you don't have the foundation to grow your business. We also can layer on privacy and security shields, which brings to life those valuable pieces such as customer managed keys, increased thresholds to remove data and being able to do automated consent policy enforcement.

00:20:58:10 - 00:21:24:02
不明
And then for those of you who may be in the health care or health data realm, we have services that will meet your needs as well. That adds on additional capabilities around things like use case playbooks. Which, if you're not familiar, use case playbooks is an ability for us to build a journey or a workflow or an automation of, audiences and segments.

00:21:24:07 - 00:21:55:12
不明
And it gives you those objects. So when you bring your data in, you can actually plug it in to where your data is, bringing your value to life faster than ever by leveraging the exact use cases that are needed today. And then we're just announcing at summit, we now have our health care schema 2.0, and that health care schema 2.0 is actually modeled after the fires schemas, which is fast health care interoperability.

00:21:55:17 - 00:22:13:59
不明
And, that allows health care organizations to bring their data in in the exact manner they already have it in their organization and have schemas readily available that they can just map 1 to 1 to.

00:22:14:04 - 00:22:32:08
不明
And with that, let's talk a little bit more about how you take those principles and how they're baked in and talk about how you manage trust. So for us at quasi, we took a step back and said, okay, we know that we now have technology. We know that we have a number of use cases, both internal and external, that we need to address.

00:22:32:13 - 00:22:51:18
不明
But how do we go ahead and make sure that all of those different functions are working together? So we fundamentally said our governance structure as a whole needs to change. It needs to evolve. It also needs to be kind of pre documented and modernized. So we looked at it and we said, okay, let's first define governance that we have that come and talk track.

00:22:51:18 - 00:23:15:54
不明
Right. And we said okay it's going to be a series of the three piece right. Policies procedures, processes. And that is going to really foundationally talk about how we are bringing our experiences to market throughout the lifecycle of someone's interaction with us as a firm, the lifecycle of their career from us presale through delivery, and really thinking about all of those components from a marketing standpoint.

00:23:15:54 - 00:23:42:20
不明
We then went ahead and said, okay, what we can fundamentally control and what we need to make sure we're very clear about is the what, when, why, who the is right, making sure that we are most effectively coordinating handoffs and delivering that external experience that is consistent, right, that is standardized so that we can offer personalization in is meeting the needs of our business stakeholders while keeping in mind that client experience or the UX that we want to be delivering.

00:23:42:25 - 00:24:08:10
不明
And then from a business standpoint, ultimately really being focused in on the how and the how often are we going to be in market leveraging those different data points, and how can they go ahead and start to consume back that information through real time CDP to be really mindful of that 360 degree view of the client, so that they fundamentally are hopefully taking different information into account that will again turn into increased sales velocity.

00:24:08:15 - 00:24:30:47
不明
So it's a really framework item that while there's data governance built in, which talks about, you know, who has access to different components, it really is a fundamental structure that starts to talk about our fundamental ways of working so that we're all aligned and we're starting to, again, flip those verticals or those legacy silos into horizontals, knowing that that passing the baton is going to be critically important.

00:24:30:52 - 00:24:53:19
不明
If I can interrupt you, John. Sure. If you don't mind, how might this be different? I mean, I think we talk a lot about B2C, but I also know you have an expertise in B2B. So is this different in the B2B space? I'd say no. Right. The biggest thing when you think about B2B is that reconciliation that your end user is both an individual and part of an account.

00:24:53:24 - 00:25:12:43
不明
B2C is all the same, and in many cases B2B is trying to catch up to B2C experiences. So when you actually start to build that framework and understand that there's going to be nuances, perhaps of your data governance and strategy, you might be trying to play off of some certain, different triggers. When you think about experiences in B2C, the fundamentals are very much the same.

00:25:12:48 - 00:25:30:30
不明
And when you talk about what it starts to give you, right, it starts to give you that concept of internal trust, because we're working from a similar playbook and creating that consistent external experience that helps increase brand authority. So I think it's all relatively same. Right. Magic's in the minutia, but there's certainly maybe a little bit of, some changing of terminology.

00:25:30:30 - 00:25:37:01
不明
But I think conceptually it's very much the same. Great. Thank you. Cool.

00:25:37:06 - 00:26:06:15
不明
So talking a little bit more about the technology. Yeah. Let's get into real time CDP and the embedded toolkit. So from a CTP perspective, you really see CDP in the middle of that, system and you can see around it, we have things like Xdm, which is the common data model, AML capabilities, embedded segmentation, governance, privacy and the like.

00:26:06:19 - 00:26:33:02
不明
So regardless of whether or not you're looking to do data ingestion with your CRM or overlay that with your CMP to make sure you know the consent that the consumer gave you and what exactly you can do with that data, or the data ingestion from another martech stack. All of that is readily available. And as you bring that data in to real time CDP, you see, data labeling and policy creation.

00:26:33:07 - 00:27:15:11
不明
So at the very beginning, we really encourage you to take a look at what the data is and make sure that you have labeled it appropriately so that if you don't intend for something to be used, it's not going to mistakenly end up as a criteria. And what of your segments or your audiences? And then as we do the magic within real time CDP, then you can outreach to different advertising ecosystems, be able to personalize at the level the consumer wants when you outreach them, and being able to take in any of your customer systems that you want to potentially export information or data out to.

00:27:15:16 - 00:27:42:07
不明
And then the the biggest pieces are what you get in terms of bringing it in all into CDP is that fast, flexible data connections. We have data source connections today that allow you to bring data from a multitude of locations, whether that's within your own stack or whether that's in a competitor, architecture stack. We also have actionable and unified profiles.

00:27:42:07 - 00:28:23:03
不明
You've heard John talk about bringing that data in so that he has the ability to look at the data from a 365 degree point of view. And so our unified profile brings all of that together for you in a very unique, unified manner so that you really understand who is the consumer that you're engaging with. And then we have, as we've talked about the productized governance, security and privacy capabilities that are foundational underneath real time CDP and what that means for you as you can activate anywhere, at any time.

00:28:23:07 - 00:28:49:18
不明
So let's talk a little bit more in depth about how to really build that real time customer data profile. You want to bring in lead with our preferences. How do you understand who they are? What's the consent? What did they say? You could do the opt in or opt out. The communication frequency they would be expecting. All of that information is necessary for you to understand the consumer.

00:28:49:22 - 00:29:18:22
不明
Then from there you layer on top. On top the person attribute data. It's really critical that you understand their name, their address, they if they want to be personalized, you can't do it without these critical factors. And with that attributes, those attributes, you can try that back to your strategy. You're collecting that data solely for the purpose of being able to do what they've asked you to do.

00:29:18:27 - 00:29:53:06
不明
Being able to say, good morning, John. Would you like that 20% discount or would you like to follow up with us with the in person outreach? All of those things are critical, and that should tie back to your strategy for the purpose of data collection, and then merge that with your behavioral data, what you have within your own sites, what other information you have within the Adobe ecosystem so that you can layer on and then create the audiences for marketing that you really want.

00:29:53:11 - 00:30:27:18
不明
Which segments do you qualify for based on, what they do or what they want, and being able to meet them exactly where they are, whether that's using their phone, which as you can see, is a really great representation here as they engage with you, Mobley, or whether they engage with you in person. So let's talk about how do we scale the data governance practices and honor consumer privacy across your business, especially as you're bringing this data in to real time CDP?

00:30:27:23 - 00:31:02:15
不明
So one of the key pieces on policy creation and our data usage, labeling and enforcement, which is a we're very proud to say is a patented capability. In our data governance capabilities, we have three main data labels that we use today. These data labels allow you to say this is the type of data that this information is, whether it's contractual and within our contractual can represent not just the contracts you have with the consumer, but the contracts you have a third party, such as we were talking about before.

00:31:02:20 - 00:31:31:49
不明
If you were to buy potentially a prospect data, and with that, you are able to say, what's the data? And within our contract labels we have one called C9, which is for anything data science. That means I am ML. You can label it whether it's your individual organization's data that you don't want used in ML, AI, ML, or if it's something that you know from the consumer that they don't want use.

00:31:32:04 - 00:32:15:20
不明
So you can actually label that field on the schema and then it won't be used going forward. The second piece of that is the policy creation. We have some out-of-the-box policies, such as not to activate on certain sensitive data labels, or not to activate on certain contract information. And the approach there is to really be able to scale your data, make your data work to create that value, and tie that value not only to your organization, but the value that it brings to the consumer and a consistent experience which allows you, because of that repeatable nature, allows you to build trust with your individual consumers.

00:32:15:25 - 00:32:38:01
不明
All of this is critical as you think about that middle layer of the data governance that we've talked about a little bit ago. And then next is the privacy, the reduction of manual efforts for you to have to figure out where the data is or how do I get the data out for something, such as a data subject rights request or a consumer right rights request?

00:32:38:06 - 00:33:08:21
不明
We have baked into all of our capabilities the ability for you to make data subject rights requests to each individual Adobe, digital Experiences application. So you can tell us, hey, I, I don't want this data deleted out of AP, but I absolutely have to have it deleted out of analytics. We understand you're the data controller, and we will respect whatever you instruct us to do using our very scalable privacy Service.

00:33:08:25 - 00:33:32:56
不明
Privacy service came to life about six and a half years ago, mainly in response to GDPR. The reality is, before that, all 13 of our applications have their own individual way of accepting those types of requests. And we heard you say, this is insane. I can't figure out how to do it 13 different ways. Make it easy.

00:33:32:56 - 00:33:49:27
不明
So there's where we baked it into the foundation and allow you to have access regardless of what you've purchased in digital experiences, to be able to affect those critical data subject rights requests.

00:33:49:31 - 00:34:13:45
不明
So I want to take the data labeling and put it into action for you. I want to help you understand exactly how invaluable this capable is from the standpoint of your strategy and your value delivery. So we all understand that there's data in you got to bring in the data, the attributes of the person, whether that's through your CRM or web analytics data.

00:34:13:49 - 00:34:37:14
不明
You need to understand the paid media you're using. And then within the data management realm within Adobe, all of the capabilities that you see in the middle are ones that are offered out of the box, and that is you're going to activate on that data. We want to make sure that if you're going to retarget, if you're going to be prospecting, that you're using the right data at the right time.

00:34:37:19 - 00:35:09:24
不明
So as you brought that data in, now you're going to set your data labels. You collect the appropriate consent. You then go in and say, in this case you've ingested CRM data. And you label that CRM data cannot be used for social media advertising, but based on the consent data, you can honor individual preferences. And then in the case of a prospect, you can actually set a time to live based on your data, hygiene practices and needs.

00:35:09:28 - 00:35:38:22
不明
Let's say that you bought that data for 24 months. The first day you bring it in, you can actually go in and set a date out to whenever you need it to, and then that data will automatically be expunged at the time period you have specified. So now you leverage those policies that you created. After you've labeled the data, you make sure you understand the attributes that were used and how you're using and segmentation.

00:35:38:27 - 00:36:07:12
不明
And let's talk about what happens when you're going to push that for activation. That data. You can see here that the policy has been enforced for segments matched to social media. It's blocked because you said this data can't be used in social media. And so the policy you put in place makes it so that there's no mistake. You actually are able to make sure that it doesn't go to a social media platform.

00:36:07:17 - 00:36:35:46
不明
But we still allow that segment that mapped to your ISP to go through and be activated. That's one additional way that you're able to safeguard your data from what you told your consumer. Because as John said in the beginning, you know, it takes a lifetime to build trust with consumers, but it only takes seconds to destroy it. When you activate when they told you not to or you send it to a location they asked you not to.

00:36:35:51 - 00:37:00:33
不明
All of these are critical pieces of your delivery, making your delivery even better. So now let's start, take some time to go into the fourth, which is tips to take back to your team. We want to make sure that you have information out of this that will allow you to go back to your team and help them understand the tips and tricks.

00:37:00:37 - 00:37:24:45
不明
Yeah. So really quick, before we get into those few takeaways I wanted to anchor in on our journey for, to bring real time CDP to life, right? And to start to build that foundation for trust. And what we really looked at in 2020, and I anchor in on 2020, because here we are in 2025. And the reality is it's it's a journey and there are a lot of learnings that we have along the way.

00:37:24:50 - 00:37:45:16
不明
But we realized that we had a lot of bespoke solutions. Those were creating a lot of technical debt and also putting our organization at risk, especially when you think about it through the lens of like data governance and compliance with quickly changing regulations. We knew that data was not a key informant. We weren't speaking the same language across multiple different functions.

00:37:45:16 - 00:38:09:24
不明
It was a lot about who owned data versus us saying that it is a shared resource and something that fundamentally amplifies our ability to get in market and to win work. And then we had a lot of aging infrastructure. Not all of our technology and not all of our processes were fit for purpose. And that is one key area that I'd encourage everyone to really think about is you do not.

00:38:09:28 - 00:38:40:42
不明
Technology itself is never going to be a silver bullet, right? And part of it is us knowing that there is a very quantifiable number when we think about investment in technology, but we don't always keep in mind that back cost, once we turn it in, turn the switch right, we flip it on. And what are all of those kind of ancillary costs that also need to come along for the ride, whether that's through the lens of changes to our ways of working or organizational structures, because we don't have the right resources, the right skill sets, in addition to, again, the ability to enable some of that personalization, which builds trust and builds brand authority, is

00:38:40:42 - 00:39:08:26
不明
also dependent upon a lot of other technologies being able to consume the signals coming from CDP. So our digital transformation really got us to a point where we have a singular data strategy across marketing. In the business. We have said, what are the attributes that we care about? We understand that data governance is a shared responsibility, and we actually are starting to activate uncommon attributes and speak that same language, inclusive of the way in which we talk about success.

00:39:08:31 - 00:39:27:43
不明
And we've started and we're on our journey to continue to modernize our tech stack so that we can drive the client experience that we expect as consumers. And we know our clients expect, which from a B2B organization is not something that I think anyone or has done a really good job of. But from a business perspective, so far ahead.

00:39:27:48 - 00:39:44:02
不明
Right. And those B2C organizations are becoming a lot more, agile. I think when you start thinking about all of the changes happening to net new channels, right, where some of the B2B organizations come along for the ride a little bit further down the road. But we have started to really think about what that needs to look like.

00:39:44:02 - 00:40:04:59
不明
And we're taking advantage of all of the innovation that Adobe is putting in with real time CDP to say we can now enable new channels and fundamentally different ways year over year, which is pretty powerful, and also something that's critically important as we realize this concept of buying committees. And we realize that it's not really a singular, decision maker in the buying process.

00:40:05:04 - 00:40:38:09
不明
So bringing it all together, our last slide are really just a couple of simple key tips for you to consider and to take back. And if we think about them, really number one is starting with that end in mind, you need to develop use cases that are both internal in nature and external in nature, so you don't catch yourself needing to re-architect you don't catch yourself in not being able to manage through change, and you're fundamentally able to talk about success at different points in time, as maybe revenue is a little bit of a laggard.

00:40:38:09 - 00:41:02:53
不明
And certainly when you start thinking about that, speaking to the finance function, about the investment, right, you need to be able to get to that point of correlating, maybe perhaps an element of brand consideration to potential revenue. Second, you need to speak that same language. That's back to that element of data. And knowing that while real time CDP enables you to say, okay, now I have a common 360 degree view of the client.

00:41:02:58 - 00:41:22:55
不明
There are other elements of data that are critically important, right? You need to align on a data governance strategy so that you're all understanding how it's going to be used, where it's going to be stored, and why, who has access to it. You need to understand those attributes that you're going to deliver externally into market, that you're going to leverage for personalization, that you're going to employ your technology to really work with.

00:41:23:00 - 00:41:48:38
不明
And that in in kind of turn also puts new, dependencies on other parts of your organization, how you develop content and version, all of that out and leverage AI. And then number three data through the lens of KPIs. Right. We all need to be talking about the success metrics. So how do you minimize some of those vanity metrics or use those point in time for your storytelling, but really focusing on those high value KPIs and know that those are shared responsibilities across.

00:41:48:43 - 00:42:19:16
不明
And then tip three it takes a village. There is an element of saying that it takes a lot of technology. My point earlier around there being all that adjacent modernization that we needed to do, that is critically key. CDP as a foundational element of your tech in something that maybe we didn't think about several years ago, is now here, and it takes a lot of other technologies to be able to deliver the experiences that we expect in those need to be architected in a way that are mindful of kind of the symbiosis in harmony between the two.

00:42:19:21 - 00:42:42:24
不明
But with that said, right, it takes a village internally as well. It's not just a marketing decision, it's not an IT decision. It's not a business decision. It's flipping all of those legacy verticals into horizontals so that you're all working together with those common business goals in mind that fundamentally, again, support that external client experience and build trust with your brand authority and reputation.
