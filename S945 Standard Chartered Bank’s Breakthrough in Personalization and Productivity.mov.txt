How many of you believe in the power of AI, and do you think it can really transform the businesses we are in? Please raise your hands. We have a lot in common. Fantastic. Okay, before I start talking about the thing, I'll just introduce myself. My name is Noman Bashir. I am head of digital sales globally. I have some responsibilities additionally in the central bank for for the local franchise in Singapore.

00:00:29:07 - 00:00:56:26
不明
An engineer by education. Started my career as a technologist. And formerly ExxonMobil. I wrote many programs which didn't work. So then I decided to join a bank with a bank for over 17 years now. Long journey. I've been part of technology in the bank. Part of. I ran back office operations in some of our, franchises.

00:00:56:31 - 00:01:30:00
不明
I've been part of investment committees. I'm currently responsible for digital business. Tennis has been a passion. Actually, it was last December. I went back to my hometown. I'm from from Pakistan and my my small hometown. And I have a, nice green stripe over there. And I used to play tennis when I was a kid. And I met the grandson of my coach, and I had I had a good, one hour session with him.

00:01:30:00 - 00:01:57:55
不明
And, that was so nice to to call some of those memories back. And then talk about, what we used to do years ago. Last but not the least. My family, I think that keeps most of us thriving and most of us happy and excited. And they tell me, when I would not work there will still be helpful and make me excited and energetic.

00:01:58:03 - 00:02:19:25
不明
I hope that's the same for you as well. My parents, they are no more in this world. I mean, they they passed away a few years back, but I think what I am or I will be, I've learned all from them. And, I remember them every day, and, they're a source of information for me for, for for every moment.

00:02:19:30 - 00:02:43:45
不明
On the extreme right is my brother. No matter what I know. He tells me. I know little about things, and he believes that, he's there to remind me as often as we talk. He has been my mentor. We talk a lot about whether it's Rumi, prophet of love, or it's about human human being augmented with.

00:02:43:49 - 00:03:22:39
不明
I get. Okay, that's all about me. Now let's talk about central Bank. I'll give you a little intro. Anyone who hasn't heard about central Bank in this room. Okay. I'm impressed. Thank you. It's, it's a leading bank. Not as much in in North America or in Europe, but primarily, we are proud to to offer our customers a network of, of over 60 markets for corporate business as well as for retail business.

00:03:22:44 - 00:03:49:41
不明
We are driving we are providing them all the opportunities on those emerging markets across Asia, Middle East and Africa and giving them that network which can give them sustainable growth. Our focus is on cross-border as a network bank and on the consumer side on, on wealth, and, and affluent business. And we are proud to share that we are we are we are a leader in that and in the markets we we operate.

00:03:49:46 - 00:04:18:36
不明
Our purpose is to drive commerce and prosperity through our unique diversity. And our brand promise is here for good. Let's talk about culture a bit as well. We have 170 years old bank. We are here for for good as as as our, promise. And as part of the culture, we develop valued behaviors. We try to inculcate that in our entire workforce.

00:04:18:46 - 00:04:42:52
不明
90,000 people never settle. We try to push boundaries, go as far as we can to help our customers better together. We are here for long term relationships. We are in the business source of of prosperity, and we want to make sure our customers grow with us. That's so important. And do the right things. Making sure the client is first.

00:04:42:52 - 00:05:04:08
不明
Whatever we do. Okay. Now I'm going to talk about the topic we are here for, which is ritual and how I will help and influence that. I'm just shows you our digital strategy. We put that a few years ago. I will take you through that. Content and personalization is key to make sure that we have tailored content.

00:05:04:12 - 00:05:29:10
不明
We provide really personal experiences to engage our customers and and drive loyalty with them. Very important value for that. Most of the conversation we had today, everyone spoke about that. Let us not do things which we can't measure. So the second pillar is so important that you need to have analytics. You need to have deep understanding of what your customers are doing, what they're able to do, what they are not able to do.

00:05:29:15 - 00:05:56:09
不明
And then that helps us learn. No matter how good the content is, no matter how deeply you understand if your sales journeys are not really optimized, it's a bit of problem and you will see huge friction despite the traffic coming in. So that remains a priority for us. So, so proud that in our markets, we were the first one to create a customer community.

00:05:56:09 - 00:06:20:20
不明
We have 10,000 strong customer. We call it inner Circle. We work with that those customers to really from from creating concepts of, of new product to new experiences and new offerings. So we we closely work with them and we have, another arm of, of, of the same, community, which is our own staff. We call it self connect as well.

00:06:20:25 - 00:07:06:20
不明
So we work very closely with them to, to, to, to to define and refine our experiences. Mobile experiences are important. And, mobile first has been our strategy. But also just want to, to share that, that when we created marketplaces in our mobile apps across the markets, we saw huge lift in our sales and conversions. So we work closely with Pega as well as with Adobe to personalize the marketplace and find next best action for our customer, whether it's a product or it's it's an action they can take, for example, to activate a card or to deepen a relationship or do a transaction on the investment, site.

00:07:06:25 - 00:07:34:57
不明
Effective digital marketing and engagement is is key. And, close partner of Adobe in in driving that. All of that is underpinned by martech ecosystem which we work externally internal partners. I see few colleagues from here from from Accenture. They are they work with us and, they really augment our skill and capability and our reach to, to drive better conversion with our customers.

00:07:35:02 - 00:07:53:33
不明
At the end of the day, if I walk in any financial district in any of our key markets and walk into any of our competitors, probably they will have the same kit. They will have same tools. The only difference what's going to make is either people in this room or your teams back home, or wherever your organizations are.

00:07:53:38 - 00:08:21:00
不明
So that is extremely important part that how do you really, scale up your teams and scale them up to do the right thing? All these pro so I will talk more about content and personalization, because I think that the, the key work we have done on the AI is, is from that area in particular. These strategies are good and it's important to have them.

00:08:21:00 - 00:08:58:07
不明
But the moment you start executing, you realize that there are quite a few problems. And let's talk about some of those problems now. Slow campaign velocity, creative asset creation. You know, efficient operations do. The thing is relevant to you. People in this room, do you have the same problem? Exactly. This is what it terms in practical. What it means in practical terms is that our speed to market is not really there, that effects are ROI.

00:08:58:12 - 00:09:23:51
不明
If you really want to personalize that scale, the speed of content creation, creative asset creation needs to be really fast. And that was a problem for us. We ended up creating very generic images or craters for our customer and didn't have time and and resource to do that. All of that inefficient process is too much of back and forth over emails, Excel files, PowerPoints.

00:09:23:56 - 00:09:47:22
不明
All these things were what were were problem. But as someone said that these problems are not fully stop signs, they are just guidelines. You need to make sure that you understand them and then you find ways how to deal with that. And that is I think we are going to talk about it now, I'll take you through, go a little deeper in our operating model, which is round.

00:09:47:27 - 00:10:16:14
不明
First part is on the, on the creative briefing and, and the workflow management where you come up with the campaign team, your overall objective, you see a lot of, and then concept development, you come up with the first set of briefs, for set of creatives and followed by, the design, execution and, and permutations.

00:10:16:19 - 00:10:40:04
不明
All of that needs to be adopted based on various channels we deal with. That is a mobile or it's a web or, any of our digital properties or even including some time offline properties as well. So that was normally the how these four areas were. All of them come together and create a campaign from from concept to, to really taking it to the customer.

00:10:40:10 - 00:11:06:56
不明
And all of them have their own challenges. They were slow. The processes were manual. As I mentioned, creative development was slow. High number of back and forth, and limited capacity for creative option. So next thing is that how how we dealt with it and what we did. Okay. Before that let me share some stats with you.

00:11:07:01 - 00:11:38:19
不明
So we in 2023, two years ago when we started this journey, we used to do around 20 campaigns per month, maybe around 240 plus minus over over a year. What, 3600, you know, in a year. And operations who run one campaign, medium size campaign was like 21 days, which is a pretty long time. And on an average, every campaign would go through 5 or 6 iterations back and forth with various teams.

00:11:38:24 - 00:12:05:37
不明
Not a great position to be in when you are competing with with, other players who what we realized we're doing is much better than us. That is where we changed our operating model. And the key change we made was to bring in AI. I call it operating model 2.0 and three pillars of of of the model, which is the concept development.

00:12:05:42 - 00:12:28:39
不明
First one we introduced activity. I'll I'll show you one example how it really helped us. On on the design execution side, we brought in Adobe Firefly. We heard a lot about it today morning during the keynotes and various conversations. So happy to share that we are the early adopters of it, and we started working on it in 2023.

00:12:28:44 - 00:12:53:15
不明
And, I think we have we we went full scale last year together with our partners, and that has really helped. And we will we'll talk a little more about it in a while. And then, adaptation of, of of the, of all the creatives, both with Adobe Firefly as well as with with if you want to call out that by no means we have completed that journey.

00:12:53:15 - 00:13:15:40
不明
We are still on that, this, Adobe work friend is work in progress. We are implementing that. And hopefully during the course of this year, we will complete that. But on the I think our conversation is more on the, on the ChatGPT, which we have, done. And we will talk about some of the results over here as well.

00:13:15:45 - 00:13:49:55
不明
Okay. It should you, for example, I don't know if you can read it from there. So this part, the concept development, what we wanted was to reach out to our customers from to drive a wealth proposition. Please do not keep cash. Please invest. And the brief was given to ChatGPT. Can you help me create a brief with which drives a change from taking customers away from cash and moving them towards investments.

00:13:50:00 - 00:14:26:36
不明
Can you read it? Okay, so, headline came up as Cash is no more the King and ChatGPT is ideas were create an image which showing a stock market like arrow going downwards and a crown with currency notes on that. So and then when that was fed into. Firefly, these two images were, these two options were created.

00:14:26:36 - 00:14:53:28
不明
So when the way Firefly work is it gives you four options. And you can pick up the the one which you really find most useful in your situation. So the brief suggested two areas, two components of the image. One was the the arrow and other is a crown. Further work on that and I'll show you a little video.

00:14:53:33 - 00:15:18:16
不明
The prompt was improved, instructions were given and the concept was refined and the creative was improved. So one side is the stock market arrow going down and the crown with with currency notes around it, that two separate images were combined.

00:15:18:21 - 00:15:43:45
不明
And after that, the last stage is adaptation, where all these images were adopted for various, channels, for mobile, for web, different screen size of mobile, more the mobile web view WebView. All that was done together with Firefly and Figma.

00:15:43:49 - 00:15:48:49
不明
And that is what we got in the end.

00:15:48:54 - 00:16:23:06
不明
Cash is no longer the king. And since we are in in multiple markets. So you could see that, you have a multi-language, creative coming out of it. So pretty crisp image, very sharp, with, with human interaction but limited human interaction. Starting the brief from, from ChatGPT refining it, coming up with options, feeding that into Firefly, working on it, combining images and creating a story which we thought is compelling.

00:16:23:11 - 00:16:41:40
不明
And just to share with you. So, as I mentioned earlier, we are pivoting towards wealth. And the lot of work we are doing, is towards, on the, on the investment side.

00:16:41:45 - 00:17:12:16
不明
Okay. Let's talk about the results. Operating model 2.0. How different that is from 1.0. Our campaign velocity has gone up significantly 1.5 x. But we used to do 240 is now 600. Assets is 1.3 x. We do over 8400 operation power 21 days have become 16 is a great. Are we happy and satisfied? Absolutely not. But yeah, that is where we are.

00:17:12:21 - 00:17:36:43
不明
And that is what I mentioned, that, the work front is still in progress and hopefully by end of the year will improve that. Our target is to to get to ten and then eventually to five. But you see that I mean, this is the improvement we have made over the last few months or a year plus minus, and working together with our partners and our teams are learning how to really adopt, this new technology.

00:17:36:48 - 00:17:52:43
不明
Okay. And I think next slide is just to share a few images created by, by Firefly. For multiple markets, multiple languages, different product lines.

00:17:52:48 - 00:18:26:49
不明
Yep. What's next? As exciting as journey has been, what we have achieved so far, I think what is even more exciting is what is yet to come. If you look at. So our focus will remain on productivity, scalability, velocity and reusability this year, what we are going to do is to extend our, our martech state. We are adding at the bottom you could see, innovative work front, something which is work in progress.

00:18:26:54 - 00:18:55:39
不明
And we are also adding, Adobe Am and CDP. That would really boost our martech capabilities, both for DIY journeys, which means do it yourself or self assisted journeys. As soon as we are working closely with our, relationship teams and we are creating those solutions for them, that this whole martech solution will support them. The are relationship managers as well for for wealth and investment and all that.

00:18:55:44 - 00:19:22:37
不明
So yep. Our our vision for future is is powered by Genio driven of course with innovation, a lot of passion. And working with with, with, with the partners to make sure that we, we create the most value out of it. I think I'll end my conversation with this. One of my favorite quotes. I have quite a few.

00:19:22:37 - 00:19:48:30
不明
So this is just one of them. So we just we were just talking about this incredible capabilities of AI and how it is transforming our customer engagement. We should also think that what is that? What is driving it? I mean, we saw the how data is helping us. We saw how AI, those tools are helping us just reflect on what further what Einstein said here.

00:19:48:30 - 00:20:25:03
不明
The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and and science. It's all about working towards that unknown. I think AI is great parts to it, a great companion for that. It really augments our ability, our capabilities to to find out what we do not know. So the most important message, which we discuss and we brainstorm and we believe it, in our, in our conversation is that let us continue this journey.

00:20:25:08 - 00:20:51:33
不明
Let's keep working towards that unknown and use these new technologies to to find that path and wherever we can be the trailblazer to create something new, which wasn't really done before that. And I that's my request to you as well. Think let's as a, as a, as a community of AI and to the source, the people who believe, as all of you said, that you are, let's continue to work together.

00:20:51:33 - 00:21:16:32
不明
It's by no means I'm trying to share that we have a master that I yeah, we have we have started that, I was talking to one of the colleagues over here. The results are encouraging. They are rewarding and exciting. But we need to work. We need to work together as an industry and share and have those learnings and, and partner with each other and, and really create huge value for our customers using these tools.

00:21:16:37 - 00:21:18:41
不明
That's all I have hope to take. Any questions.
