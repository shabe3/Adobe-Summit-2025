00:00:00:55 - 00:00:26:42

Shout out to you, stalwart. Phew! 8 a.m. Summit Day two A hearty welcome and a salute to your diligence. I think if we were actually creating an audience segment that represented you, you would be the summit Maximizers you got out of bed, you got caffeinated, you got here, and you're ready for a healthy dose of top customer experience trends.

00:00:26:47 - 00:00:48:23
不明
So trend hounds, thank you, thank you, thank you for being here today. This is always a cool session because hey trends are trending. It's an awesome and interesting time to kind of talk about what's new, what's maybe flash in the pan, what's going to be here for a minute. Thinking of you. Metaverse.

00:00:48:28 - 00:01:09:47
不明
That was Aaron's joke, Aaron, about six people laughed at that. Looking at you metaverse. But hey, some of these trends are here to stay. And as a matter of fact, we couldn't have even imagined sort of the payload of interest that we would have in, say, a genetic AI when we ran this study even just a year ago.

00:01:09:52 - 00:01:36:16
不明
So I'm Adam Justice, I run Portfolio solutions and, portfolio and solutions marketing for Adobe Enterprise such and what? And all that stuff. And that's a long title. But the cool thing is that part of my team is the Thought Leadership crew that has issued recently the 15th annual version of, the AI and Digital Trends report, which is available to you now.

00:01:36:21 - 00:02:01:17
不明
Don't go looking for it just yet. We will be referencing this, data throughout the session today, but huge ups to the team that that did that. In fact, Aaron Hanson McKnight right here in the front, Jim Clark from consultancy, our intrepid partner in this effort. If you're down for like a gritty conversation about methodology or how you land a survey like this in a company like Adobe, these are your people.

00:02:01:22 - 00:02:30:11
不明
After the session, for sure. So, I want to pull out these cue cards because speaking of methodology, methodology, I want I wanted to make sure to mention that that research report is the product of over 3400, input and interviews from six executives and practitioners and 8000 consumers. So if you're wondering when you see the data points that we're referencing today and like, okay, well, maybe I mean, where do you source that data?

00:02:30:16 - 00:02:58:35
不明
I do have a pocket here. Voila. It's a significant body of evidence, and we're happy to kind of distill it down into some meaningful trends for us today. But first, let's talk a little bit about like why these trends are more important than just kind of seeing what's going on. I think all of us as those practitioners and executives and decision makers, we want to know, like at the heart, what's important about customer experiences today.

00:02:58:40 - 00:03:28:10
不明
Here's something that's important. In our research, we see that over 70%, 71% of consumers actually expect and anticipate that the experience they're going to get from you will be personalized and helpful. Then, as a follow up question, how effective are the brands you're in you're interacting with? How effective are they at delivering this type of experiences? Sadly, the data reveals that much fewer.

00:03:28:15 - 00:03:53:19
不明
We are missing the mark. Not every one of you. I'm sure we have some all stars in the room, but collectively, we're missing the mark. We're missing the opportunity to meet the expectations of these critical, critical people. So hopefully when we look at, when we look at our trends, will identify ways that we can start to kind of conceptualize how we close that gap.

00:03:53:23 - 00:04:19:47
不明
And I'm confident we're all working on this gap because we've been working on this for years. But hopefully we can bring to light, we can bring to light some really interesting data for you that is incredibly contemporary and super informative. And to help me do that, I'm going to welcome, to coworkers and co-presenters and overall good people, Marta Frattini and Vivek Pandya to stage to to join me.

00:04:19:47 - 00:04:49:22
不明
Let me get a round of applause for these individuals. Marta. Welcome, Vivek. Let's have a seat and we'll get awkward if we keep standing. So we have Marta here today because Marta is, in fact, one of our resident experts in interacting with with all of you. You see here that she's Director of retail and consumer industry strategy. So, Marta, you're going to be a great sort of I think, addition to a lot of the empirical evidence that we look at today.

00:04:49:22 - 00:05:17:34
不明
But why don't you let everybody know a little bit about, yourself and what you'll be adding to our discussion today? Yeah. Thanks, Adam. Hi, everyone. Good morning. I worked for 20 years in retail myself. Last I got prior to joining Adobe and at Adobe, I'm part of our digital strategy group, so I work with tons of our top customers in the retail industry, every day on the topics of digital transformation, personalization and scale innovation.

00:05:17:43 - 00:05:37:24
不明
So I'm very excited today to bring the perspective of what I hear from customers in the field. Thank you. We're excited to hear it. Vivek, how about you? Yeah, thanks very much, Adam, and it's great to be here. As I mentioned, I'm Vivek Pandya and I lead the Digital Economy Index initiative, and I'm the director of Adobe Digital Insights, and we're here at Adobe Digital Insights.

00:05:37:24 - 00:06:04:59
不明
We are the research and data driven insights wing of Adobe. And we look across over a trillion data points. We look at visits, product sales, and we get a lot of insights that we share with executives and customers, stakeholders to provide online trends. And that's what we're going to be sharing today. Excellent. I mean, we would believe you even with just that smart sounding accent, but the fact that you're representing that tremendous, what about my Italian one?

00:06:05:09 - 00:06:09:11
不明
Oh, my.

00:06:09:16 - 00:06:34:01
不明
Marta like to say. Yeah. Your accent is amazing and believable. Okay. All right, well, with that, let's get into our first. Let's get into our first trend. And these trends are kind of based on the distillation, like I said of a lot of this data, and trying to make it consumable and interesting, for everyone. So here's trend number one.

00:06:34:06 - 00:07:05:43
不明
AI and predictive analytics are growth drivers. Dramatic pause. I doubt anyone is surprised by that. But for me, the interesting thing about this takeaway is that second to last word or maybe the last, the last two words. Well, what we didn't identify is that AI and predictive analytics are super interesting for people this year. In fact, based on our research, brands expect AI in pretty good predictive and analytics data predictive analytics initiatives to be the primary contributors to their organization's growth.

00:07:05:54 - 00:07:24:07
不明
This year. And based on my conversations over the last few days, I think everybody has a lot of kind of pent up energy about this. There may be few fewer direct paths to actually, considering or identifying that growth. So with that, we're going to turn to you and ask you a little bit about what the data showing.

00:07:24:08 - 00:07:49:16
不明
Yeah. So when we look at the API data specifically we're seeing AI assistant platforms. The visit referral growth is huge. It's we're seeing it double from where we were from August to September. And it's doubling again, you know, every two months. So ultimately that puts on a path where we've seen about 1,700%, in terms of that growth since July.

00:07:49:17 - 00:08:03:41
不明
So a lot of momentum there. We're seeing users very comfortable with these AI system platforms, and that's having huge implications for how they interact and what it means for customer journeys.

00:08:03:46 - 00:08:29:41
不明
I'm sorry, I kind of I forced a pause on you but didn't intend to, continue. Yeah. I think we have this opportunity to really think about where consumers are leaning towards to get what they need in a very specific way. They're prompting that user guidance, and the user prompts are helping them understand these are the opportunities in terms of the products they're looking for, the services.

00:08:29:56 - 00:08:48:46
不明
And that's what we're seeing that out in terms of that growth. Thank you. Yeah, I was actually kind of caught up in a thought. I mean that these numbers are bananas, right. But it's so interesting to recognize that this isn't just hype when we talk about organizations thinking, oh, this is where growth is going to come for from us, for us.

00:08:48:46 - 00:09:08:20
不明
And we're kind of dabbling around in these things. There is kind of, an undeniable truth that our customers and consumers, those people that think that we're maybe not meeting the bar of their of their of their expectations yet are already using these tools, and they're using these tools just to walk right up to your front door. Yeah.

00:09:08:34 - 00:09:31:35
不明
Thanks for that. That's super solid. So, moving on to another data point here, which I think is we don't mean to be a wet blanket. But let's talk about the truth. So in some of our research talking about kind of how are we going to close that gap, we asked organizations that can sort how how they feel about their ability to actually deliver exceptional customer experiences.

00:09:31:35 - 00:10:02:50
不明
And surprisingly, like the customers. And this one I found shocking, to be honest, because this is over one year's time in 2024, 25%, of course practitioners that's already low, 25%. Of course, practitioners felt enabled and confident in their in their ability to to deliver these exceptional experiences. Over one year, that number cut almost in half. So I don't know, maybe all of us in the room are feeling a little bit of, anxiety about sort of the introduction of these new tools and the expectations of consumers.

00:10:02:58 - 00:10:21:25
不明
And are we better off and are we more equipped to meet these kind of to meet these expectations? And at first blush, it looks like, maybe not. But as shocking as the data might be, I think there's something here that we need to solve. And, Marta, I'm going to look to you maybe to kind of because you're interacting with customers on the daily.

00:10:21:25 - 00:10:47:28
不明
And by customers, I mean all of you. Maybe you can kind of tell us a little bit about what you see going on. Yeah. I mean, I think so. First of all, the bar of consumer expectation keeps moving, right? Keeps getting harder and harder. And I think, they're getting more impatient. So we have research that shows that it takes about two bad experience to lose a customer, but six good experiences to build loyalty.

00:10:47:32 - 00:11:10:26
不明
So there's only a few opportunities in which you can interact with the consumer and really need to get it right. The other thing that I think is really happening is the definition itself of personalization is changing. I think in the past few years, it's been moving outside of the realm of just traditional marketing more into the area of like end to end customer experience.

00:11:10:31 - 00:11:35:22
不明
So consumers really expect that, element of like a seamless, relevant experience, end to end, which by definition relies on personalization heavily. Right? They expect companies to be able to identify and recognize them as they hop from one device to the other to continue that experience seamlessly, to things that see things that are relevant to them. And so this is not new for companies.

00:11:35:31 - 00:12:03:59
不明
I think it's been a priority for companies forever. They've been working at it. They have done great progress. But with the VA continues to move, the complexity continues to increase. I'm not too surprised that companies are feeling less confident and less comfortable. I think the good news is that with AI, we are seeing an incredible acceleration, right? Like we are seeing that AI is giving companies a chance to actually finally close that gap.

00:12:04:04 - 00:12:23:02
不明
And we are hearing a lot of momentum from the customers we work with about how AI, it's actually helping them accelerate some of that and meet those expectations and drive that growth. Thanks, Mala. I love finishing on a high note with a message of hope. I think that is kind of the interesting thing. Maybe we all sense that at first.

00:12:23:13 - 00:12:42:09
不明
Maybe we had some anxiety, but as we build familiarity with these tools, we realized that maybe what we had like some trepidation about, might actually be the tool or set of tools that help us actually kind of rise up and close that gap between expectations and what we're able to accomplish. So with that, let's hit the next trend.

00:12:42:14 - 00:13:07:35
不明
Next trend is that unified data makes or breaks your business. I feel like, old what what's old is new again, right? I mean, we've been talking about this conundrum for for a while now, but we know now as more, as much as ever, that disconnected data leads to disconnected experiences. And I've been at Adobe for like a long time, 15, 16 years.

00:13:07:40 - 00:13:32:56
不明
And I can remember in my very early days at Adobe, I was a, you know, I was a, eager product marketing manager for Test and Target. And we were talking about, the phenomenon of Intesa appointment. Has anyone heard us talk about that before? That's when you kind of you leverage your amazing marketing and you build anticipation with your customers and then they engage.

00:13:33:03 - 00:14:01:14
不明
Maybe they cross channels only to be disappointed by the fact that your disconnected data is leaving them in a position where their expectations are not being met, because that disconnected data leads to disconnected experiences, which leads to disappointment. Hence anticipation. Disappointment, and disappointment. I feel like I over overwork that. So but this is, an interesting point that.

00:14:01:19 - 00:14:26:09
不明
In the context of being able to close the gap between what we're delivering and the experience that our customers are actually having, it's incredibly important. But when we say unifying data, it's not just something that we need to kind of get straight for ourselves. It's something that can be actually quite sensitive. And we got some, we got some input through this study where 80, 88% of consumers say that responsible and secure data handling is incredibly important to them.

00:14:26:09 - 00:14:56:46
不明
In fact, 60% rate it as, as critical. And I think, Marta, I'm going to turn back to you to kind of help shine some light on this finding. Yeah. I mean, for me is, I do want to really stress privacy and security are absolutely a priority, right? I think we hear from consumers that they're very optimistic about how I will improve their customer experience, but they're also concerned that companies might abuse their data in the process.

00:14:56:50 - 00:15:17:49
不明
And so I think it's really important as an industry that we think about this and are proactive about it, and I'm transparent about it. I think when I look at the leaders and how they are approaching it, they clearly have guidelines and frameworks. And they're not just internal. They openly are transparently communicate those to their own customers.

00:15:17:54 - 00:15:38:25
不明
The second point about data is AI is not the silver bullet. The model is going to only be as good as what you train it on. And so I think, again, like you said it, what what's all this new again. Right. So companies have been working on data for a while. The thing is, with AI, AI is accelerating everything.

00:15:38:25 - 00:16:00:12
不明
So I think that gap between the ones who get it right and the ones who get it wrong is going to get larger. And the window of time that companies have to fix it is unfortunately getting it a little bit smaller. So I think it's really, really critical that, everyone focuses on getting that right. We see it even as companies move from POCs to scale.

00:16:00:12 - 00:16:19:44
不明
Now with some of the AI projects, right? You can hack your way into a posse somehow and like as a proof of concept, proof that it works. But once you need to scale it, if the fundamentals are not there, you are in trouble and you cannot. Right? So gotta think proactively about your data. Yes. Thank you Marta I think absolutely the stakes are higher now.

00:16:19:44 - 00:16:38:23
不明
I mean, we've kind of established that I might be the path to close that gap, but, you're going to get nowhere quick if you don't have the right data to in to inform those models. In fact, Vivek, let's turn it to you for some insights on that, on the concept of data. Yeah. And and you know, we're talking about disconnected data.

00:16:38:23 - 00:17:03:04
不明
And I think when we talk about that, we're talking a little bit about walled gardens. And there's a huge demand for really incredible experiences as these traffic journeys are shifting. And a great example of this is, you know, we were able to look across social media, affiliate influencer traffic, and we found that type of traffic converted nine times better than general social media traffic.

00:17:03:08 - 00:17:23:11
不明
So there's a big opportunity there to really personalize those experiences and maintain and track it as these things shift and occur in ways that we haven't anticipated, how quickly they're moving, but they're becoming more important than ever.

00:17:23:16 - 00:17:45:20
不明
I honestly think the data that you share like 1,200% nine times, I mean, this is like something that would be it would be so simple to miss, but yet so kind of catastrophic to kind of the opportunity that is available for you by simply ensuring that these data sets are aligned and included in kind of in, in your overall sort of reference set.

00:17:45:25 - 00:18:25:24
不明
So let's move on to the next trend. Thank you both. Trend three the journey requires bridging internal divides. Again, maybe not new news, but nonetheless I think super confirming because organizations are as challenged as ever, maybe more so with kind of identifying who actually owns the experience. So when you look at these two colorful wheels or donuts, you see immediately, when we ask how marketing and technology executives view ownership of the customer journey, marketing roles, no surprise, largely believe that the team or marketing are in the catbird seat or in the pole position for owning the journey.

00:18:25:24 - 00:18:51:05
不明
But yet, when you ask anyone in a technology role, surprise, surprise, they believe that they own. And not only that they should, but that they do in fact own the customer experience. So the I think the interesting news here is that everybody can be right. Right. It's it's not necessarily bad at the end of the day because everybody that everyone has a sense of ownership, because everybody has a role to play and everybody needs to believe in in that role.

00:18:51:05 - 00:19:11:25
不明
So the trick will be actually figuring out how do we coordinate these efforts, rather than creating internal competition and boundaries that sort of get in the way of us ultimately delivering, a like an excellent customer experience and closing that gap that we saw very early. So I'm going to look to you because I know you've done a lot of thinking about this.

00:19:11:25 - 00:19:39:57
不明
In fact, you've been sort of in the boardroom, so to speak, with organizations trying to figure out, how do we solve this? Yeah, absolutely. And I've been through the pain myself and through the pain with a lot of our customers. And I think that you're absolutely right. When you put the customer at the center of organizations that have been product centric, merchandizing centric, service centric, it's a complete paradigm shift, right?

00:19:39:57 - 00:20:13:51
不明
So I actually don't think it's really about who owns it because the customer touches everything. So like no one owns it. That that's almost the wrong question. Right? The real question is how do we all work together and are all accountable towards that common goal of delivery, a great customer experience. And so we actually did Research Suite Incisive as well on this topic, serving over a thousand of executives and we work with customers every day and hear it and kind of identified what are the pillars of the ingredients of success, right.

00:20:13:51 - 00:20:35:19
不明
Because because we also see a lot of companies that are successful at these. And I think what's interesting to me is that these projects are real transformations. And when they fail, about 70% of the times, it's not because of technology. Technology is an enabler. It's because of people. And processes. Right. So when we think about the pillars, number one is sponsorship.

00:20:35:23 - 00:20:59:56
不明
You need to make sure that there is executive sponsorship that the leaders in your organization often make these a top strategic priorities for the company. Number two is partnership. Because we talked about everyone touches a customer. Right. So to be successful it's really important that you establish strong partnership cross-functionally with all the members and teams involved at all levels of the organization.

00:20:59:56 - 00:21:24:18
不明
Right? So it has to be cross-functional leaders just as much as cross-functional practitioners and doers. Number three is KPIs. Because whether we like it or not, people gravitate towards doing what they are measured on and responsible for. So there is really a shift in those who are successful in how do you think about goals? How do you measure success?

00:21:24:23 - 00:21:54:14
不明
How do you measure your team? So shifting from just channel metrics, not abandoning, right, but also layering things that are maybe a bit more meaningful around lifetime value satisfaction incrementality other types of measures. The fourth aspect is skills and upskilling. You need to ensure adoption of technology adoption of new ways of working. So you gotta train your teams.

00:21:54:19 - 00:22:13:10
不明
And I think one thing that is sometimes overlooked here is really making sure that you are looking at the talent that you have, beyond just what the role is. Right? Because I think very often in our organizations, we have people who in their background, in their interest, in their experience, they might have what we are looking for.

00:22:13:15 - 00:22:35:34
不明
We just not know because it's not in their job description today. So you got to look internally as well as externally, because very often you have that talent. And last but not least is governance. So obviously transparent decision making constant communication and feedback loop. Because again, this is really a transformation for companies for sure. Yeah.

00:22:35:34 - 00:23:02:56
不明
Ultimately you need strong competencies across these pillars. Right. Because this is consumers demanding speed and urgency. And this is a vector that companies can compete on. You know, they want to be able to deliver across the board here so that the experience is pretty profound and it can support these extensive journeys. So just to be clear, like I've noticed a few people kind of taking a photo of this picture of this slide.

00:23:02:56 - 00:23:28:10
不明
If I did that, I was writing a note for myself to review immediately after the session. Now some at some point there. This is a recipe by which we establish what good looks like to kind of rally our internal institutions and organizations and teams around and around this. So we kind of bridge that divide from distributed ownership, where we all then rally around owning something that looks like this.

00:23:28:10 - 00:23:56:52
不明
Correct? Correct. Okay. Thank you both. Okay. I think that we're ready now to move on to the next trend. And it is trend number four. We're making good time here, folks. Trend for winning brands prove ROI on AI. And I knew this trend was I knew this was coming. And so I've had a couple of, table conversations with folks over the last couple of days and found that this is absolutely true.

00:23:57:01 - 00:24:20:42
不明
And it's interesting because I think it probably isn't a surprise anyone. But it is always like cart horse tale as old as time. Like if you want to continue to invest, the organization wants you to prove ROI. And yet things are so nascent that you're wondering, well, how am I going to get to a place where I can demonstrate ROI?

00:24:20:47 - 00:24:56:49
不明
On, on these, on these types of initiatives? So here's what the research told us, that about 53% of senior executives using AI report significant improvements in team efficiency, yet only 12% of organizations have working generative AI solutions in place that demonstrate a clear why. That's a conundrum. And so what I've found right now is that, organizations obviously they need to figure out how do we get from the playground into production, how do we get from a place where we're going from belief to proof?

00:24:56:54 - 00:25:21:32
不明
And I think executives and let's face it, even practitioners, all of us kind of on the daily now, probably several of you have, you know, an app on your phone where you just ask and a quick question, maybe using Microsoft Copilot, maybe using ChatGPT or something. We're all start. We're dabbling in it. It is infiltrate our lives. But how do we get to a place where we unlock this critical element?

00:25:21:32 - 00:25:39:58
不明
Because we all know how you know how things work when you're looking for budget and when you're looking for. Here's kind of our go forward strategy. So the fact I know that you have some data on this and I think it's super interesting. So can you point us in a direction where if we're thinking about ROI, where we might go looking?

00:25:40:02 - 00:26:05:19
不明
Absolutely. And I think we might see some more, more snaps taken of the slides because essentially we're seeing the conversion gap close on AI and source traffic compared to non AI source traffic. So within just eight months we've seen that gap go from 43% to 9%. So it's it's gaining. And we've seen that increase since July up about 53% in terms of conversion.

00:26:05:23 - 00:26:31:49
不明
So in a very short period of time, we're seeing consumers become even more familiar with these paths, these journeys. And as a result, we're seeing them. We look at the data, but we also survey and ask users, and they're trusting the results more. They're finding it easy to navigate and they're using it more. And as a result, they're essentially taking advantage of these deep research capabilities across the platforms.

00:26:32:02 - 00:26:53:43
不明
So that's really accelerating things. It's even accelerating relative to what the early days of mobile and the incremental conversion we see there. So I would say there's there's a pace that retailers, brands, everyone's gonna have to keep up with their thanks for that. And I think it's a great it's a great kind of marriage of this data. So we went conducted this research and we asked all of you what you think about these things.

00:26:53:54 - 00:27:19:06
不明
But the that for you and your team to come here with Adobe Digital Insights and say, here's what we're actually seeing people do. And by people I mean our consumers, our customers, the people that we want to do business with. I feel like this is pretty revealing, and it's kind of an interesting companion point to your point earlier, just about how much sort of our target audiences are already there.

00:27:19:08 - 00:27:43:41
不明
Yeah, they are leveraging these tools to interface with us. So it's an amazing opportunity for us to take this kind of data back into our organizations and say, if we can't show up, if we don't respect the fact that this is the way that consumers want to deal with us now, then we the gap will widen, not, narrow.

00:27:43:46 - 00:28:14:47
不明
Okay. All right. Next data point. So companies with proven AI solutions are two times as likely to have completed ROI measurement frameworks compared to those rolling out or evaluating AI options. I think this is probably a logical sort of point B on this, on this topic, where you would imagine that those piloting rolling out or evaluating AI adoptions, are kind of farther behind those that are actually rigorously approaching, an ROI framework.

00:28:14:47 - 00:28:35:45
不明
So I guess word to the wise, what we're suggesting is that, well, what the data suggesting rather, is that you take an approach that isn't just dabbling, you know, where you're not maybe running a thousand, a thousand little projects, but you're being intentional and thinking about how these tools are going to get into scenarios where ROI is accessible.

00:28:35:45 - 00:28:52:58
不明
And, Marda, I feel like what we're looking at here is an inflection point, really a critical point for organizations to kind of accelerate towards, identifying and building plans and, and getting to action. So we're going to turn to you to, to kind of maybe illustrate some of the things that you're observing on this topic. Yeah. No, absolutely.

00:28:52:58 - 00:29:13:00
不明
And I mean, this is one I'm really passionate about. And I feel like for me, if I leave the room with one thing, it's probably this one. Okay, hold on, everybody, because Martin just said this is the one thing. No, because I threw the gantlet down. Well, you know, I think as marketers and I put myself in the bucket, right?

00:29:13:00 - 00:29:41:36
不明
Because I'm a marketer, I have to I've done it forever. I think we have. We are biased towards activation. We gather incredible data. We analyze the data because we like data driven marketing. We activate incredible experiences. We measure to a certain extent. We obviously measure like Fryer's openness, clicks and whatnot. But marketing executives are under unprecedented pressure to like, prove the ROI of their investments.

00:29:41:41 - 00:30:01:21
不明
And part of it is because we got ourselves in trouble. Right? Because yes, we measure, but we don't always measure the right things. We don't always measure the meaningful things. Right? We don't always take it outside of just the channel perspective into a more holistic perspective. How am I impacting the top line? How impacting the bottom line?

00:30:01:26 - 00:30:43:03
不明
What is the incrementality customer lifetime value? Customer satisfaction like that goes back to the organizational aspects we were discussing before. And so I think we've been through this, all of us. I think we do I we are early enough in the journey that we can be proactive and think about it differently. So I think I really encourage everyone as you start your projects, your POCs, your, your, your bigger development, not just focus, but also really think about activation, about what is the measurement framework that goes with it, because we make sure that there is clear ROI there, like there is growth.

00:30:43:08 - 00:31:06:44
不明
And I think what we are seeing is that either companies don't always think about measurement, or sometimes we take the easy route, which is efficiencies are very easy to quantify. Right. Top line growth. Again, you need to think about the framework. So I really encourage everyone to think about it because you are going to be asked at some point to prove the value of what you're doing to continue to secure your investments.

00:31:06:44 - 00:31:31:35
不明
Right. So really make it a priority as you embark on the journey. So don't become kind of punch drunk with the idea of activation, even though we have like, fantastic new tools that might help us accelerate. But WordStar tools to measure. So, And we do. Yeah, we do have tools to measure. And you're saying, like, make sure that you are methodical and thoughtful about the measurement before you get out the gate.

00:31:31:36 - 00:31:52:03
不明
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Thanks, Martin. All right. That leads us to our fifth trend. And I believe, and our fifth and last, we're going to dwell on this one for a bit. This has been kind of obviously, you've heard from our main stage, it feels like a generic is on the tip of everyone's tongue, even if they don't even really know why it is what we are talking about.

00:31:52:08 - 00:32:17:09
不明
It is what we were talking about today, the evolution of generative AI into this exciting space of a genetic AI. And here's what we found in the data that a genetic AI represents an opportunity to compound your advantage. So those of you that have recently maybe been trying to convince your children to open a savings account, you know, and delay that gratification, and you're trying to teach them the idea of compounding interest.

00:32:17:16 - 00:32:45:03
不明
We're talking about kind of the same thing right now. We're at an inflection point in business where there is an opportunity, where a genetic killer has the potential to give some organizations even more of an advantage over the competitors. But if the gap between brand delivery and customer expectations continues to expand, as we saw, these tools will make it exponentially harder for you, for us to catch up.

00:32:45:08 - 00:33:02:34
不明
If we're not, if we're not ready to proceed. And I think that, like you put a fine point on that where you show how consumers are already the tools are absolutely in their bag of things that they're using to interact with brands. So absolutely, it can be case, it can be a case of compounding advantage if we do it right.

00:33:02:34 - 00:33:25:31
不明
But, you know, the converse is also true, sadly, that as these requirements for sort of excellent cross multiply and being thoughtful about building your measurement framework to get to a place where you prove your ROI and, you know, proving ROI unlocks it, investment. Absent that, you put yourself in a position of compounding disadvantage and nobody wants to be there.

00:33:25:31 - 00:33:49:44
不明
Do they market? Yeah. No, no, I think it will be a very interesting balance because I think as AI accelerates and we are already in the era of Atlantic, companies will have to become more comfortable with the uncomfortable and uncomfortable doesn't mean reckless though. So I think you touched on it. Right. Like the focus, the intentionality is really critical there.

00:33:49:49 - 00:34:16:36
不明
We believe, as I'm sure most of you have seen, yes, we see today when we talk about agents, we strongly believe that they will be the most effective when we understand what they exist in service of. Like what are we building them for? What are we using them for? And I think what I'm seeing is that whether it's I don't I or I don't think like that really also helps with that adoption aspect.

00:34:16:36 - 00:34:43:20
不明
Right. Because in any organization there are most likely areas, whether it's repetitive tasks, whether it's get into better insights, faster content variations. There are areas where the company can feel comfortable starting to use some of this technology without relinquishing too much of like the brand control brand area of safety. So that's what I would encourage everyone to do, right?

00:34:43:20 - 00:35:03:48
不明
Start thinking about what are those areas where you can be intentional, where you can feel safe? Because that is very often a way to start. And then from there you can continue to build, because, I mean, the train has left the station at this point. So it's not I don't think it's an option to, like, not get on the train.

00:35:03:53 - 00:35:37:51
不明
How you get on the train is what you have to start thinking about. Thank you. Yes, we're on the tracks. We are on the tracks, folks. In fact, I think so. If you if you were in our keynote yesterday morning, you saw a little talk about the Adobe Experience platform agent, orchestrator and ten new agents. Interestingly, I was, happened to be in the boardroom not trying to, you know, I don't know, I was in the boardroom with our CEO shortly when we started talking about the agents that we wanted to announce at summit this year, and we had a pretty robust list, and it kind of stopped the conversation.

00:35:37:51 - 00:35:57:29
不明
And he said, hey, I want to know the job description of every one of these agents. I want to know the role. I want to know the title. I want to know the person that they exist in service of. And I want to know specifically what each one of them did. And then that that's kind of what got us to that pretty curated list of ten, purpose built agents that we described.

00:35:57:29 - 00:36:13:11
不明
And I think part of that is you're just kind of I think you are expressing what our culture is and our approach to these agents, which can be tremendous tools, like to take the mundane out of the tasks to automate where there is opportunity. So I think that's kind of an interesting thing to take in, by the way.

00:36:13:12 - 00:36:31:58
不明
I think that might have been the sound bite of the day. We got to get comfortable with the uncomfortable, but comfortable doesn't have to be reckless. So accent or not, you're just dropping bombs on us today. You're dropping truth bombs on us today. Marta Frattini, everybody. Okay, so let's continue with this. And Vivek, I you're you're showing up.

00:36:31:59 - 00:36:56:42
不明
You're showing up around three with some of this hard hitting, evidence and data that helps make this point. Yeah, absolutely. Thanks. So when we think about the traffic, we talked about conversions from I source traffic versus non I source traffic. And it's pretty staggering on the graph there where we see the the the traffic coming from. These AI sources are not leaving immediately like the non source traffic is.

00:36:56:43 - 00:37:26:00
不明
So the bounce rate is far more improved from this AI source traffic. And that speaking to the relevant results, consumers are getting the retention and that familiarity and that adoption is really moving these KPIs in a significant way and engaging is up 24% from these AI source traffic sources. So all that's an advantage for many of these retailers to take advantage of, because there's a there's a big growing opportunity there.

00:37:26:00 - 00:37:58:51
不明
As adoption scales, you have users testing this out, trying different things, but now they're really operationally operationalizing it in their daily lives. And that's the improvement we're seeing the that has such like a calm and cool demeanor and delivery on this stuff. I think that maybe sometimes the impact is lost on what you're sharing. I think about my career as a marketer and how we would literally throw a party for a couple of points, increase, of solving on bounce rate to get to a place where you're looking like out of the gate.

00:37:58:51 - 00:38:22:31
不明
Here's an audience where you can expect a 24% improvement. If you can figure out how to effectively kind of capture, engage, and convert these individuals, I feel like that is incredibly, incredibly significant. Moving. All right. So I think that we all need to kind of process that data and realize that it's time for us to respect that this is happening.

00:38:22:31 - 00:38:44:15
不明
I think if you take anything away, hopefully we've kind of brought maybe some of these trends. You felt like, well, I could have guessed that, and you probably could have because you're smart people, but I love us sort of bringing the truth in about like, it's not just about what we are trying to imagine is the truth. It is what our customers, consumers and the general public is showing us is the truth.

00:38:44:20 - 00:39:11:25
不明
And that's really well put out there because, you know, and I have a few more, few more insights to drop before we round out, because what we're ultimately seeing is just the the deep research and that driving from or that intent driven mindset is improving the core metrics around time spent on site. So we see consumer spending 41% more time that they're they're spending time on the site, 41% longer than non AI source traffic.

00:39:11:39 - 00:39:35:33
不明
And they're exploring the pages. You know, there's a 12% uptick in the amount of traffic that's exploring these pages if they're coming from that AI source. So again this is happening very quickly. And it's making these big impacts across the KPIs. And being able to funnel that enthusiasm and drive the impact overall has has a lot of opportunity for the retailers.

00:39:35:38 - 00:39:57:37
不明
And the other cool outlet I'll I'll share is, you know, our team's calling card is essentially, the holiday insight. So if you're ever curious about how much people are spending on Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, that's our team. So we're very much looking at these metrics in this context. But then we also look at how things look over the holiday season and these moments like Cyber Monday.

00:39:57:37 - 00:40:20:47
不明
And that's where we're also seeing things really shoot up. So on Cyber Monday itself, we saw about 20% year on year increase from AI source traffic. So you have consumers leaning on it to find cheaper versions of goods, booking trips. All that is happening in a really profound way, and it's showing that many of these trends are here to stay.

00:40:20:52 - 00:40:49:37
不明
Yeah, I just another nonchalant 2,000% there from, from Vivek. Thank you sir. And I think it's appropriate for you to say that that is in fact, a trend that's here to stay. So and I think I can't help but think and I don't know where maybe all of you are. Maybe your, B2C company, maybe you're a B2B, one of the one of the things that Adobe and this is a little bit of a, Adobe on Adobe kind of insight.

00:40:49:42 - 00:41:10:31
不明
One of the things that we're thinking about in our own marketing, is sort of evolving the way we look at, what our marketing is trying to do, you know, get getting beyond just pipe gen and really embracing a new notion of the engaged visit of the engaged consumer. And how do we effectively put measurement in place.

00:41:10:31 - 00:41:30:56
不明
So I'm just going to let the sake of screwing things up. I'm going to rewind just to this speaking of like trying to get to a place where your consumers are actually engaged with you, or coming with a mentality and a mindset that they're here to engage 41% longer, 12% more pages per visit. I mean, this is this is the truth that thank you.

00:41:31:00 - 00:41:55:41
不明
So all right. So, that was actually our fifth and final trend. Not that we couldn't have found more, but we wanted to be sort of respectful of everybody's time and give you an opportunity to choose your own adventure through this amazing kind of through this amazing, data. So I would encourage everyone to kind of take the time to familiarize yourself with this 15th annual AI and Digital Trends report.

00:41:55:45 - 00:42:17:05
不明
You can find it easily. And if you're wondering, we also have like some specific data and call outs, for these, for these POVs, if you're thinking, hey, it'd be great if someone just showed me how this was particularly relevant to, say, financial services or something. Along those lines. So, the fact Mada, you guys were wonderful.

00:42:17:12 - 00:42:42:11
不明
Thanks for, dispelling truth and excellent insights for us today as part of Digital Trends. I have it on good authority. I ask them that both Vivek and Mada are willing to kind of stick around. We have a couple minutes left in this hour if you want to approach them and ask them questions about either the things they said or the things that you imagine they know based on sort of the, amazing insights that they shared with all of us.

00:42:42:15 - 00:43:05:45
不明
Or if you want to talk to the people that ran the reports, they're also here. So those are the trends. I hope we'll see you next year. We'll have new trends, I think, man, the earth is spinning at an accelerated rate, but beneath our feet, it feels like. Right? I mean, it's not like days are now 18 hours, but it does feel like what we are all expected to know and manage is just accelerating by the day.

00:43:05:50 - 00:43:26:29
不明
So, we were thrilled to kind of share this insight with you. I honestly feel like if we would run this survey right now, instead of Jim and Erin, how long ago did we drop the survey? Six months ago. December, December? Three months ago that we would already have, new and interesting, compelling findings. So by all means, let's see you again next year.

00:43:26:29 - 00:43:50:54
不明
Same time, same place, maybe not eight a Am. For those of us that really had to peel that mattress off our backs this morning, but, appreciate your attention. Yeah, like I said, please feel to come forward if you have some additional questions. But go get that report, enjoy your summit. We can work our way over and see the day two keynote, where we're going to be sharing some exciting new innovations about unified customer experience and B2B for those, B2B folks in the room.

00:43:51:08 - 00:43:52:42
不明
Thanks, everybody. Appreciate you.
