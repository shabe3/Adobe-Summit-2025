00:00:00:23 - 00:00:22:32

Welcome to that. Today's session. So yeah. So it's quite great to see you guys coming around. And, today we would like to talk about a session from Adobe, which we would like to tell you how to launch a small independent motorcycle company called B motor on a global marketing platform using Adobe Edge that, delivery services.

00:00:22:37 - 00:00:47:46
不明
So please allow me to introduce ourselves. So my name is, so brand originally I'm from South Africa, but living in Germany and working for as a principal, solution architect at Cognizant Moment. And today with me on stage is, terrace. We've been working together for about three years. More or less like that if I want to.

00:00:47:46 - 00:01:12:47
不明
If I'm not mistaken, I say we've been working with you and Kawasaki Group. He is. He is a strategic manager for the UK Motors Europe. And together we've launched quite a few websites across the globe with Adobe Experience Manager. So we have got some experience. So with that I would like to pass over to Harris and, you will actually have a quick chat about who we are or who is b moto.

00:01:12:52 - 00:01:36:45
不明
Thanks. Asking you continue. Thank you for the introduction siren. So I'm excited to be here. Happy to see people showing up. So before we move on to the technology and how this project came to life, I would like to spend a brief moment on to talk about the company that we're about to display and give you guys an impression of what it is that we do.

00:01:36:50 - 00:02:11:51
不明
Yeah, great. So let's move on. So let's go back to 1878. That's when Kawasaki actually was born, a company that would go on to revolutionize engineering and for over 70 years already has been pretty much, helped define the world of motorcycles. Now, imagine Italy in the 70s, right? So three visionaries created b moto. So their mission was actually to build motorcycles with unmatched craftsmanship, precision powered by the best engines available, like our own Kawasaki engines.

00:02:11:56 - 00:02:44:13
不明
So they didn't follow trends. They set new standards when it comes to designing new products. So fast forward to 2019. Kawasaki had an opportunity and it was to reignite the Be motor brand. So blending its handcrafted excellence with Kawasaki cutting edge technology. Together they start a new chapter. And today well be motos back, a brand built for those who demand more exclusive machines, higher quality and ultimate performance.

00:02:44:18 - 00:03:14:36
不明
A product for the connoisseur Kawasaki motor. Together we're offering something special the perfect blend of power, design and performance. So now we're reaching into a new, discerning generation of riders and thrill seekers. A partnership, a vision and a future. And this is just the beginning. So with all that said, let's have a look at our one of our motorcycles that's actually road legal, followed by a display of racing heritage.

00:03:14:36 - 00:03:47:09
不明
We'll show you two videos. Enjoy. All right. All right guys, let's move on to the videos. You guys can have a look at it.

00:03:47:14 - 00:03:56:21
不明
You.

00:03:56:25 - 00:04:04:07
不明
Do.

00:04:04:12 - 00:04:11:49
不明
The same.

00:04:11:54 - 00:06:24:06
不明
You.

00:06:24:10 - 00:06:54:50
不明
So it doesn't really matter how often I see this. Gets me excited every time. Do we by any chance, have any motorcycle enthusiasts in the room? Well, that's quite a few. Okay, good. So. Onto you guys, Harris. Yeah. So it is actually quite true just to actually look at this, type of machines. It's quite wonderful. But kind of taking that as a bike person, my, myself, it does get the blood pumping every time you see that.

00:06:54:50 - 00:07:27:47
不明
Specifically that racing video. Because speed that is something that penny company demands when it comes to digital marketing and the digital website. So the best part of going forward with that is with Adobe HD, taste, delivery services. So this is kind of highlights what type of speed and demand is the what's B motor. So with us has a company we understood that B motor has had quite unique challenges when it comes to this.

00:07:27:52 - 00:07:57:27
不明
And we had to help them to actually get out to the product and get the market out quite quick. So there was three or quite a few, type of challenges. But the three main ones comes down to basically is that they need a very fast website. They need basically to scale globally, excuse me, and to ensure very high quality content, delivery with very minimal effort.

00:07:57:32 - 00:08:20:31
不明
Exactly. So as a small company focusing on digital marketing while launching a new website just ahead of, global, motorcycle show, that was quite daunting, to be honest. But so that's maybe the next segue, how we can discuss how we approach these challenges. Yeah. True. So you can actually go through that. Sure. So that's actually like a, like a very good point.

00:08:20:36 - 00:08:52:18
不明
So we as I'm cognizant moment, we've kind of basically, centered our approach on the agility and right technology for a rapid deployment, giving it a very, very tight deadline that we had going into this major global motorcycle show. Things are quite tight, but at least we kind of recommend it to, Kawasaki can be motor to go with Adobe Edge to delivery services.

00:08:52:22 - 00:09:25:57
不明
We have had quite, good success previously with rapid migrations using it before. So we're quite confident that this is the best choice for the technology. Yeah, well, the choice of technology was quite critical, but to be quite honest, we already had very long experience with using Adobe Experience Manager. So when you guys propose something new, I was quite skeptical, to be honest, because we were venturing something that was, for me, at least, unknown.

00:09:26:02 - 00:10:02:04
不明
Yeah, true. So that is a, understandable because this was a new product from Adobe. While your Adobe experience manager and our partnership that you had with that is extremely powerful. Be motor needed something a bit quicker and very easy to use, especially with a small team. Excuse me. So we needed something faster. Much lighter, than the Adobe Experience Manager, but still can integrate with the Adobe ecosystem.

00:10:02:09 - 00:10:23:48
不明
Even with the Adobe Dam integrations, which is actually quite important also with the Adobe Analytics, going forward to some sort of, third party vendors like France's cookie management, dealer find us with the excellent maps systems. So we needed something that can actually work really well for this company, and to go with speed and to go outside.

00:10:23:52 - 00:10:53:33
不明
So yeah, so so let's dive a little bit deeper into what this product can kind of offer to you guys. So, the best benefits of what Adobe Edge devices can offer from an IT perspective is that it's a platform that ensures very fast and more reliable content, delivery via the Adobe managed site in globally. So it is also a kind of optimized for like high, content velocity.

00:10:53:38 - 00:11:26:24
不明
Looking at that, you can grant, meaning it, it can handle quick loading, high quality media for engaging a proper user experience on any, any device. Plus it kind of, seamless integrate like I mentioned, with any Adobe tech, tech stack. So the ease of integration, simplifies our overall, target texture and reduces complexities and scalability.

00:11:26:29 - 00:11:54:58
不明
So looking at how to scale this quite globally. So that kind of helps us to reduce, latencies. And the speed is just very, very good streamlined with this content publishing and an agile terracing experience were quite essential for your small team, user friendly, to authoring sometimes with large stuff like, Adobe Experience Manager can be sometimes a bit, cumbersome.

00:11:55:03 - 00:12:21:38
不明
But looking at this, anybody with standard, document based knowledge, they can quickly adapt. And that will reduce your, training time, which is really good. I couldn't agree more. So I remember the first time you guys pitched it to me and the premise was basically, if you know how to use something like Google Documents or any of the Microsoft Office apps, you'll be good to go.

00:12:21:43 - 00:13:01:06
不明
So we tested it, and within a few minutes, I was actually able to to author, review and publish pages within, I think, 20 minutes. So it's not just about speed, it's also about empowering your team, which it actually does. Yeah. So that's actually quite true. So I'm going to say a little bit. So if you, if you're going to like a very large team and the people kind of know how to use any word style document, with very little training and just to show people how to use it, you can actually bolt pages, like you said, preview, publish and it's life as easy as that.

00:13:01:06 - 00:13:21:29
不明
So it's a really, really great product to, kind of use. But now going forward, so we can all speak about how fast is going to work. But, I think sometimes some people like for me, I get quite excited about drawing pictures as an, solution architects. So I like kind of blocks and arrows and things like that, I think.

00:13:21:34 - 00:13:51:07
不明
So to kind of explain a little, a little bit more how the whole architecture comes into about is so we'll kind of set up for you a git repo. So with that you'll get the base, product, if I can put it in that sense where you can extend go a lot further. So if you're developers kind of know JS and CSS quite well, they can extend building into proper features for proper markets.

00:13:51:12 - 00:14:24:42
不明
So you don't have to have the same market across the globe, but you can also extend it to like, further market. Then looking at that going into our document based system. So you can use either Google Drive or for like much larger, enterprises, you can go into like SharePoint. So with SharePoint, you get a lot better security, so you can control what type of users need to go in and who can do the authoring for you.

00:14:24:46 - 00:14:54:41
不明
Again, it all integrates really, really well with your Adobe. It's delivery services. Again, people can do the content blocks, they can bolt on a page, preview it, and then it can actually view it and click on the web and publish. It's really, really fast. Quite easy as you to mentioned. So it works kind of quite well. All of this kind of integrates and flows through our, Adobe managed, CDN, which we prefer to use.

00:14:54:41 - 00:15:20:44
不明
So it's all cloud based as well. And with that it can go to any client which includes desktop, mobile, whatever you actually want to do it for. So it works really well. And the whole system kind of flows well together. Going into that, let's have a look at how this can scale your digital solution into any type of business.

00:15:20:49 - 00:15:48:04
不明
So let's have a look at that with your Adobe experience. Delivery services you can produce much faster content. So if you look at a big corporate company and you need to produce some sort of marketing, promotion that has to go out with some companies, there's quite a lot of big flow where it goes to you have to get marketing guys need to approve.

00:15:48:09 - 00:16:09:21
不明
It needs to run through quite a lot of channels to actually get to it, which can sometimes be, a little bit of a pain. But with this, I can assure you, you can get people who would like us. Like I said, he can do the quick authoring, get it out, get it published, and it's live. Really simple.

00:16:09:21 - 00:16:39:52
不明
That and it's that simple. So it means that with this fast, content way of producing, content, be Mozart could actually quickly update and they can get the online presence out globally really, really fast. And also with AI, scalable architecture, this thing supports growth. So, we can go out into the world, produce more sites with very, very ease.

00:16:39:52 - 00:17:22:44
不明
And the, content authoring kind of empowers your team to manage this content globally quite effectively. How would you say I wouldn't agree, couldn't agree more. So with all that said, I think it's also worth noting that when we started this project, I. It took us eight weeks from start to finish. We didn't have anything. We had a very old website that was obviously not working the way it should be, and we started the project and within eight weeks, just before the launch, of a new product on the icMl 2024, which is the largest motorcycle show in the world, we completed it.

00:17:22:58 - 00:17:44:26
不明
Something, to be honest, that I have never experienced before. So it shows you what you can do if you have a trusted partner with the correct technology. Right. So what it can do for your business. So what did it do for us? The website went live and not so long ago we did a deep dive on the analytics.

00:17:44:31 - 00:18:10:57
不明
So the SEO and performance improved significantly. And that resulted in far better engagement. Right. So as you can see on the slide and the last metric is maybe for us nowadays maybe the most important one. So when you look at global statistics available, 65% of the traffic almost is now done via mobile users. Right. So mobile compatibility is an absolute must.

00:18:11:02 - 00:18:37:45
不明
And this approach just proved that this was the correct technology for us. Yeah. That's actually quite true. Right. So it's also great to see how trusted partnership approach and the tech have resulted in a high quality website for bimodal. And because it's such a small company, of course they're part of a big company like Kawasaki, but it allows them to punch above their weight.

00:18:37:49 - 00:18:59:46
不明
Yeah, which is quite true and had to see how this site is currently not performing. We can truly say that the speed at a site is actually loading, so that's the one thing I just quickly want to dive into is with Adobe experience, all with this product, I kind of measure it with a thing called lighthouse speed.

00:18:59:51 - 00:19:27:25
不明
So, so for some how to actually, set us up is that the site will load really, really fast. You can kind and measure what type of metrics are you going to use, what type of graphics, how it loads. You can see everything. And that will help you to determine which is the best way to go forward. And the sites do loads really fast and you guys are more than welcome to go visit the site.

00:19:27:37 - 00:19:53:15
不明
Actually now on your phones you will see that it it does kind of load fast. So to see how the site is performing and with the proper scalable architecture and with Adobe, it's delivery services, this is quite a truly a very great, trusted partnership. We have created a robust digital foundation for motor and to take this truly to a global scale.

00:19:53:20 - 00:20:28:39
不明
And thank you for that. So it's quite clear that the strategic, approach, the choice of tech and the trusted partnership because that's pretty much the most important one, if you ask me. It kind of was an instrumental step for us, making sure that we motor is ready for the next steps. So we're confident and just not so long ago, I think a few days we actually decided to roll out, within the next 12 weeks, we were probably scaling up to, I don't know, ten more markets.

00:20:28:39 - 00:20:57:30
不明
So I hope you're ready because we will have some work to do once we return. So looking forward to that. Yeah, there's actually quite fantastic news. And I think, the rollout globally and yeah. So just to show how quickly we can do this and with the ease of how quickly we did deploy that, that one site, it means a guy out globally on a proper, content strategy.

00:20:57:41 - 00:21:21:30
不明
This can work really, really well. So truth be told, I know that you guys probably have heard about it before. Adobe actually, some delivery services, some people are quite skeptical about it, but I can truly say that that is just a myth. This is truly a remarkable product. And like I said, with the correct partnership and with the correct, clients.

00:21:21:30 - 00:21:51:05
不明
And so you can really, really take your business to the next level because this one, to make sure that you that you can launch your company into us, into the future with fast and reliable websites. It's truly, truly magnificent, to be honest. Just to add on top of that, so specific for our market. So we're mostly active in Europe, but we have rolled out these websites all across the world already, and what makes it difficult for us?

00:21:51:05 - 00:22:17:15
不明
We have so many different languages. We have multiple currencies, multiple rules. So it's quite a complex environment. And to see how this is so flexible, which kind of empowers us to scale up very easy. So I think we can roughly do three weeks per market, maybe even quicker, which is to me that's remarkable if I'm alone. So yeah.

00:22:17:20 - 00:22:43:39
不明
Yeah. So I think from a deployment point of view for to get all the content out, I think our biggest challenge would be a translation to get the site translated from a technology point of view. It's really simple. It is. Yeah. You get the translations in or even use AI nowadays. Copy paste the content in there and press publish and you're good to go.

00:22:43:44 - 00:22:59:40
不明
Yeah. That's simple. All right. Great. I think we're there. Yeah. Thank you for your time. Yeah, I think I was I think.

00:22:59:45 - 00:23:00:15
不明
You.
