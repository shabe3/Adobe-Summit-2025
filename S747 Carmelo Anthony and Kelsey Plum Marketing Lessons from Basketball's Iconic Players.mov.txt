00:00:00:39 - 00:00:29:18

Hi everyone! Thanks so much for choosing to be here. We are going to have so much fun! I have personally been really, really looking forward to this session. So let's get started and bring out our all stars. So with two WNBA championships and two Olympic gold medals and a three time NBA all star, all at 30, she is not only fearless on the court but off the court.

00:00:29:25 - 00:00:43:30
不明
Please welcome Kelsey Plum.

00:00:43:35 - 00:01:02:42
不明
And as executive chairman of Code and Theory, he is the gold standard of emerging creativity and technology, helping global brands reimagine audience engagement. Please join us on stage. Dan Gartner.

00:01:02:47 - 00:01:11:42
不明
This is a.

00:01:11:47 - 00:01:39:50
不明
And ten time NBA All-Star and recent co-founder of then the Seventh Estate. He has truly built a brand that transcends sports. It's so cool to be here with Carmelo Anthony. Carmelo, please join us.

00:01:39:55 - 00:02:00:13
不明
And Carmelo, I have to say thank you to you and your business partner, Sonny, for sharing your wine with us at dinner tonight. I mean, it was so delicious. So action item for any fellow wine lovers out there in the seventh estate. I mean, it's delicious, especially if you're into French wine. So. Yeah. Thank you. That was that was really good stuff.

00:02:00:17 - 00:02:22:19
不明
We have a lot to to cover, so I'm going to just dive right in. And Kelsey and Carmelo, let's start with you, because I was reading a study by momentum and the Sports Business Journal recently that said about 50% of fans are making purchase decisions based on athlete endorsements. So that's powerful stuff. And you both have like, truly powerful brands.

00:02:22:24 - 00:02:49:25
不明
So I'm curious how you stay focused with all the brand pressures and how you're using technology to amplify your brands and your deals? So I don't know, Kamala, let's let's start with you. Okay, Kelsey. Ladies first. Yes. So I think for me, the main thing is the main thing. I love to play basketball and that's why I'm standing on the stage right now and or technically sitting swiveling.

00:02:49:29 - 00:03:24:19
不明
But I, I've really tried to take a lot of pride in that, as, like, my craft and then from there, opportunities, blossom. And so I think just overall having an idea of like, okay, who am I? And what is important to me, and then aligning myself with brands that I'm in alignment with, because I do think it's kind of Carmel and I talked, on a panel, just a while ago about how it's not real when you see certain people or athletes, partner with brands and you can see that it's not genuine and it doesn't, connect with the consumer.

00:03:24:19 - 00:03:49:59
不明
It doesn't connect with, you know, people watching and, it just is like, hi and bye by. And so, you know, I want to make very genuine connections and partnerships and make impact with, not just like my community, but also other people watching. And, especially as a woman just wanting to be able to align myself with brands that are empowering and really, support, other women and make an impact.

00:03:50:04 - 00:04:26:13
不明
Yes, I love that as a woman, aligning, aligning with brands that are powerful women. That's awesome. Yes. Marlo. You ready for me? This room a little quieter here, man. Me nervous up here? Yeah. Okay. I think for me it's about actually really figuring out exactly who I am and what I want to do and what brands I want to align myself with, but also what brands align with my brand mission as well, because you can have, you know, people that represent brands or partnerships and just a brand alignment that just doesn't work.

00:04:26:13 - 00:04:44:10
不明
I think for me, it's about being very intentional and and what brands I line myself with, with brands that we can kind of utilize, you know, one another to get to the common goal, which is to make something special and to get the consumer out there to, to to come in and join whatever community that we actually trying to build.

00:04:44:10 - 00:05:02:22
不明
So it's about being authentic to myself. If I feel like the, the brand that I'm talking to is talking to me is, is authentic. And they, they put in the groundwork and, and they, they, they have missions and they have morals and it aligns with you know, my missions and morals and it that that makes it a lot easier to do business.

00:05:02:27 - 00:05:32:19
不明
So it's a authenticity. Gut check. Absolutely. Yeah. Very cool. Dan, over to you. You've helped countless brands find their voice. So what is your secret to helping brands, businesses, athletes get ahead during this moment of massive tech transformation? Yeah, I think it's important, to distinguish two different things that often get conflated. And that's the idea of implementation and innovation.

00:05:32:23 - 00:05:59:24
不明
And people use it in the same way, but they are a completely different things when you're implementing. It's important. Obviously we're at Adobe Summit. That needs to happen. You have to enable yourself to be able to have a platform to do things. But innovation is about creativity. And, you know, if we're going to use software, especially at Adobe, Sam, and talk about creativity that comes from innovation, imagination that is different and there needs to be value on that.

00:05:59:29 - 00:06:23:18
不明
So whether you're a brand or you're an athlete and you're thinking about like how to position yourself and in different ways and connect with audiences and, and in new, innovative ways like share of attention is, you know, really difficult, like and just a better data platform is not going to distinguish yourself when you're racing to the bottom, when everybody is implementing the same data platform.

00:06:23:31 - 00:06:51:07
不明
That's not the way to do it. You have to be innovative and the best brands have some history and moment in time where they're innovative, and the best influencers or athletes that have broken out have some way they use the platform in a different way. They connected with an audience in a different way. Obviously, authenticity is important, but it's like, how do you do that in a way that separates you and that difference between implementation of and innovation is just so stark to me.

00:06:51:12 - 00:07:11:02
不明
But I just don't see it is, clear for others. Yeah. No, that's that's a great point. And it's not sounds like it's not just data. It's not just creativity. It's both. And how you activate them together is is what gets those results. So very cool. Kelsey, so you told your mom when you were ten years old.

00:07:11:02 - 00:07:41:44
不明
I read that you wanted to be a WNBA star, and and you did it, like, amazing. So inspirational. Through the journey from being a college recruit to being a WNBA all star. You've seen how a personal brand can grow. I'm curious because I heard about your your dog class, if you can tell us about that. And it's Dog Day for for those of you out there because my Jersey accent, it's probably not coming through.

00:07:41:49 - 00:08:01:19
不明
Can you share a dog class and what that's about and what it means to you? Sure. My mom's actually here. Oh, I don't know. Where's mom? Somewhere. Did they not let her in? Adobe. I just come on out the door. Anyways, my mom's the best I did. I walked into the kitchen when I was ten.

00:08:01:20 - 00:08:27:16
不明
I said, mom, I just want to let you know I'm going to the league. And credit to my mom, she just nodded and said, okay, let me know how I can help. And, it's actually crazy because she told me when I did end up getting drafted, she said, hey, I just wanna let you know, when you told me that I had to leave the kitchen and I cried because that's a big dream for a little girl to just come and have so much bold faith about.

00:08:27:16 - 00:08:55:44
不明
Right? But as a kid, you don't know any different. You just. I mean, you guys know, you just have a desire in your heart. God gave you the desire to also give you the ability and I just I ran with it. So I just want to thank my mom, even though she's not here. No, but, but my mom, but dog class is a, camp that I created with Under Armor, partnering with them, and the NBA, it's a little bit different.

00:08:55:44 - 00:09:14:28
不明
There's a lot of time between the end of the college season and then the NBA season, and there's a draft process that is in place. There's a ton of support. There's a combine and there's a ton of agents, a resources that allow these young men to transition, to the NBA. There's no such thing in the WNBA.

00:09:14:29 - 00:09:39:32
不明
We have, from the end of the NCAA championships to the start of the NBA season, is maybe 14 days, and it's sink or swim. And, it's one of the toughest leagues in the world to make. It's 144 players all fighting for spots. Feels like no one ever retires. So it's just slim pickings. Diana retired. She's 42.

00:09:39:37 - 00:10:00:46
不明
So all that to say, I had a tough time transitioning, and I wanted to change that. And so I just provided, basically three days of camp. I bring all the people that I work with strength and conditioning, mental performance, Pilates, and then on court basketball and just create a community because at the end of the day, especially like Carmelo knows, basketball is really about community.

00:10:00:46 - 00:10:23:53
不明
It's who you can call and say, hey, I need help. What should I do? What do you think? You've been there. Can you help me? And so creating that community and allowing these women to know, like, hey, I'm here as a resource. I also have friends in the league that are resources. And we want you guys to be able to build this bridge that we're building and walk over it and have a great transition to the next phase of your career.

00:10:23:58 - 00:10:50:25
不明
So long story short, that style class, we're going on our third year. So it's very exciting. Yeah, that's that's super awesome. And I love that you just that mental component, which I know is a big part of of what you do and being successful on the court. And I've seen multiple studies over the years say that roughly 95% of women in the C-suite C-suite positions played sports, and over half of them played college sports.

00:10:50:25 - 00:11:21:32
不明
So I think it's just extra cool what you're doing, because the learning's really it transcends from from sport to business. And you're really, like, fueling that success even in the work space. Beyond the basketball. So so thank you. It's it's really cool to see and inspiring. Carmelo you've worn many hats. Athlete. Entrepreneur. Philanthropist. How do you keep your creative spark alive and how do you decide, which opportunities are worth pursuing for you?

00:11:21:37 - 00:11:50:49
不明
A lot of times it's a lot of things are actually trendy, right? So to alleviate myself from the trends, I step back away from and and see how long all these trends are going to happen. What's going to happen within these trends? And when is a dip in these trends and when is it peak? So those are things that I play around with in my head when looking at businesses and what I'm going to do as far as how to handle and juggle the many hats that I that I wear it all makes sense.

00:11:50:49 - 00:12:10:42
不明
It may look like it's all over the place, but they all connect some way somehow. And then. And then it's all through the storytelling. When we was talking about wine making and we talked about cigars and we just, you know, we talk about it's it's cultivating at the end of the day. So even though I'm in two different industries, it's still the same thing.

00:12:10:44 - 00:12:41:34
不明
It's cultivating is getting down and talking to the farmers and talking to the winemakers, and they're really having a conversation and able to bring a different type of storytelling to that industry and that industry in particular. I wanted to speak about that because it's it's an industry where we can really take advantage of, when it comes to content and telling stories, because there's so many stories that something that needs to be told from the way winemaking is, is, is made all the way down to the soil and everything in between.

00:12:41:34 - 00:13:03:28
不明
So is is we we try to look at it, that industry as more educational at the same time. Or we can bring people in and implement stories into what we have going on and create these courses. So that's just different creative ways of of tapping into the wine industry. And, and a sense but overall is is really about your connectivity.

00:13:03:28 - 00:13:19:31
不明
Like if I don't have no connection to you is very hard for me to even sit down with you and have that conversation, we can talk. And, you know, I could give you ideas, you could give me ideas, and maybe that's the length of that relationship is going to go. But I would take that advice and I would try to utilize that.

00:13:19:31 - 00:13:42:08
不明
But it doesn't mean that I have to go out there and and be a brand partner with you. It just doesn't work sometimes. But when you find that flow with a brand and you find that niche and what works, it's a beautiful partnership. And those are partnerships that I look at. I mean, isn't from, you know, are talking even the last you know, our everything for you that connects is your passion.

00:13:42:12 - 00:14:00:00
不明
Yeah. It's like the passion is the connections. Yes. Your multiple hats seem to just go naturally without. Yeah. Because I is I'm very passionate into what I do. And to answer the question on what earlier what drives me, it is the passion. It is me being passionate about what I do, what I put my name to, what I put my brand to.

00:14:00:05 - 00:14:20:20
不明
Because a lot of times I am the brand I am, you know, my name is the brand. And you know, we try to figure out how to get away from that. But is is unfortunately it is what it is. And we try to make it work. What is fun is fun identifying companies and talking to different brands and seeing where they stand and and what they plans are and what's the future and what they trying to accomplish.

00:14:20:25 - 00:14:42:25
不明
And I just sit there and observe a lot of times, just be a student and just figure out where I can help that brand and implement what I bring to the table. Yeah, absolutely. And I echo that. I mean, your passion, at least for for the wine industry and talking to you about that last night and hearing, the stories, the travel, the, you know, experience at making the wine and, and drinking the wine.

00:14:42:25 - 00:15:19:55
不明
I mean, it's, like, it's it's definitely inspiring. So, thank you for sharing that. Dan kind of kind of on this topic, athlete centric content is so huge right now in sports for growing overall fandom. How are you looking, taking advantage of of data and creativity to leverage the this athlete centric content in a way that, you know, achieves the goals for teens and leagues and progresses fandom while still remaining authentic to the athletes themselves, because we know we heard how important that authenticity is.

00:15:20:00 - 00:15:42:25
不明
Yeah. I mean, I think everybody starts at the wrong place. You have to start at emotion like we're talking passion is emotion. We now, you know, the digital technology that we all want to talk about is I, I allows us to engage with computers and robots in human like ways. And if it's human like ways, what are you really talking about?

00:15:42:25 - 00:16:10:40
不明
Emotion. And you have to get to that point. So to get to that point, we like to call it creative intelligence. You're not artists are artificial. It's just artificial with like creative bone. Creative intelligence has to is not technology that allows to have exceptional experiences. Exceptional experiences allow you to get to emotion and that needs to connect. So that's again like that's one thing that all has to be connected.

00:16:10:55 - 00:16:33:17
不明
If you silo it, you won't get to it. And if you don't start an emotion, if you don't say that, start the human, the consumer, the user, the fan, whatever you want to call that person, you have to start there. And then you have to look at the business or the athlete. Where are those connection points? And then you can put the creative and AI intelligence and the data and the technology that just enables that.

00:16:33:30 - 00:16:57:40
不明
But you have to understand who you are and who you're speaking to as humans. Because this all this technology will drive us to figure out the definition of what humanity is. And, you know, I'd like to just say this important thing because people get lost in sort of defending sort of what is the role of a person, what is the role of a human?

00:16:57:44 - 00:17:16:05
不明
And now we have advanced technology. When you think about how to, you know, how to use data in different ways, this is the harsh reality. We will not tell the technology what is uniquely human. The technology will tell us what is uniquely human. And what I mean by that is if it could do it, it will do it.

00:17:16:10 - 00:17:46:01
不明
It will figure itself out, or we will help figure itself out and we'll capitalize on and around that. We will see what really we want, what are real, true, need, want and desires. Those range of emotions, how we strive for maybe authenticity when there's a lot of synthetic information content out there, how we thrive for like reach out for stories around wine or cigars like those things will show us more and more what is uniquely human, and we will revolve around that.

00:17:46:01 - 00:18:11:40
不明
We will not tell it what is uniquely human. I love that. Thank you for sharing that perspective. I love it, I mean, yeah, it's it's a harsh reality, but it's true. Yeah. And I think it's a good thing because, the internet sucks right now. I just think, like, you know. Yes, it's like connected us in certain ways, but it hasn't connected us, like social media was once called social networking.

00:18:11:40 - 00:18:30:55
不明
There was a movie called about in the Promise was we were going to connect as humans in a different way. Now it's called social media and it's about consumption. And then advertising and everything like that. So how is that amazing? How is that enriching our lives? You know, you think about like the IT industry, information technology. There's a lot of consultants here.

00:18:30:55 - 00:18:51:40
不明
They call them IT professionals. Well like that's just like how good is information for us. We like Doom scroll. We're like polarized. How is the internet supporting that. So like you can play this out. The internet actually sucks. And now we're at a moment where we have incredible technology that hopefully will fuck the whole thing up, will literally disrupt it.

00:18:51:44 - 00:19:11:40
不明
Some of us will be a little scared because we don't like change, but out of it hopefully will be. I'm optimistic and often tells you don't wait. No, you know, no, I love it, I don't listen. Instagram's The Devil's app. I don't even have an on my phone. Yeah, yeah. No it's it's like horrible. It's bad. Yeah I mean like mental health issues.

00:19:11:40 - 00:19:29:04
不明
Yeah I mean it's great for like targeting and retargeting like that's great if. Well well let's talk about this because I mean social media, I mean there's a lot of people who use it and and like I agree with no usage is great. That's awesome. Yeah I know, I know, you know I, I by the way, you know it's awesome.

00:19:29:04 - 00:19:59:02
不明
Also awesome like crack crack. Oh perfect. Perfect comparison. I'll get in the crack industry. Yeah. Oh, geez. All right, all right. So let's get another. Oh let's focus. So, so social media is still very much real and utilized, by athletes, by brands and by fans and consumers. So I think it's, it's part of the marketing mix.

00:19:59:02 - 00:20:19:47
不明
Like it's hard, it's hard to ignore. As marketers, I don't think we should be all in there. And I think there should be, a responsibility to to how you use it and how you encourage the usage there. But, but it's out there and it can be amazing in certain ways. It can be inspiring, and it can be a great way for athletes to connect with fans and share your voice and and share your message.

00:20:19:47 - 00:20:37:35
不明
And but it can also, like, not be so awesome as, as we talked about. So I'm actually curious to hear more from the athlete perspective, how do you use social to connect with fans and how do you stay grounded? Maybe with the buzz and yeah, all the things that go along with it. It's this is not a bash.

00:20:37:35 - 00:21:03:22
不明
Like he wasn't bashing internet. No, I love I love the internet. Let me just clear this up. Clear that up. Yeah. But for me, like social media is, once you learn how to utilize social media, then it becomes fun. Because now I can I can engage with my fans off of the data and information and I can I can target audiences and communities that I really want to target and really want to talk to and speak to.

00:21:03:26 - 00:21:24:08
不明
And I can build my my business or product off of that community right there. If I start off with 200 people or 50 people, that's fine with me because I know that I'm in this community with these 50 people. Every single day we going to talk, we're going to utilize information. We're going to take advice from one another and then for me, that's how you actually able to grow the community.

00:21:24:08 - 00:21:43:33
不明
But you know, understand how do you utilize social media is key. Most people I don't think know how to utilize social media. I don't even really know how to utilize social media. And but I utilize for what I need to utilize it for. I get the messages across, and I that I need to show the authenticity and everything that I that I have going on.

00:21:43:47 - 00:22:00:17
不明
I speak to my fans, and then it's times when you don't want to speak to the fans. It's unfortunate. We need a break from fans is at the end of the day, right? So we need time, our own personal time to be off the internet and do certain things. But you know, you put out there what you want out there and you put the stories in the content that you want.

00:22:00:17 - 00:22:22:44
不明
People to to see and engage with. Yeah, I think that's a great point. Things aren't inherently good or bad, maybe, but it's how you use them. Yeah. So that, I think the difference between what Melo is saying is like he understands his fans. Yeah. And he figures out the boundaries and makes sense for him and his fans.

00:22:22:49 - 00:22:44:34
不明
Some of it is instinct. Some could be good technology that even guides his decision. But he doesn't stray away from that. He's not starting with what's the tech platform, right. He's starting to what makes sense from him and his companies and his brands, and what makes sense with his audience. But then when companies scale, they lose that essence, the connectivity.

00:22:44:34 - 00:23:04:28
不明
Yeah, they start with like, what is the technology now? What is my fan or user, consumer viewer or whatever you want to call them? What do they want? Yeah, correct. And it has to stay there. And I'm not saying by the way, don't use Instagram for some altruistic thing. I think you should use it. I'm just saying that like if you stick to a race to the bottom, you know what happens.

00:23:04:28 - 00:23:30:43
不明
You race to the bottom. And if you try, we want to differentiate like understand your user and use the technology and the creative intelligence to drive value to that. This is a positive thing, even though like this shitty part of the internet is the amazing part of the internet because that's where differentiation happens. So. So stay true to your why and have that help guide and figure out what your way out.

00:23:30:44 - 00:23:45:26
不明
Yeah, that a lot of us are trying to figure that out. So I know it can be fun to if you don't take yourself like that serious like like it can be fun. Like I actually appreciate sometimes in the fans like, excuse me out on Twitter because I didn't get there parlay. Like I was like, I actually like like, okay, that's that's valid.

00:23:45:26 - 00:24:08:32
不明
Like I got you next up. Thank you. That was a it was you better account. Yeah. Well this thing is like to adults. And I seem like the younger generation understands how to utilize social media more than certain generations or other generations because it's is very fluent to them, is so easy to them to navigate and really find exactly what they looking for.

00:24:08:32 - 00:24:35:37
不明
Like they almost know how to target things better than we know how to target, you know, audiences and products and things like that. It's it's amazing to sit down and watch kind of this younger generation, you know, kind of just navigate like do the internet and social media because you can sit down and really learn so much from watching this younger generation, the way that they navigate and the way that they are starting to kind of take on this, this and this role of individualism.

00:24:35:41 - 00:24:56:31
不明
Right. If you think they have this, they are very individualistic and they think individualistic, and it is all about what's happening right now and how are we going to make change and how are we going to break through. So the way that they utilize social media is a lot different than the way we may utilize social media, which is very beneficial to us because we actually learned from that younger generation.

00:24:56:36 - 00:25:18:52

I'm still on Myspace. I catch up. And you probably see some of this with your son, which I do want to talk about. In a little bit will come. We'll come back to that. But but let's shift gears for for a minute here. I want to, talk to you, Dan, about another one of the biggest challenges we're seeing in sports right now.

00:25:18:52 - 00:25:40:46
不明
And it's really around distributed meteorites deals which which are driving, you know, big bucks for the leagues, which is great. I mean, we see it across the leagues. You included. However, with these distributed media rights deals, it's making it increasingly more difficult to be a fan because I'm sure some of you in the audience struggle with, like, how do I watch my favorite game?

00:25:40:46 - 00:25:58:44
不明
I have all these subscriptions, but what channel is it on? Which app is it? In which streaming service do I need to sign into? It's it's like it's difficult, right. So then how, how have you worked maybe with some of your sports clients on addressing this, this very real challenge and making it easier to be a fan?

00:25:58:49 - 00:26:25:35
不明
Yeah. I mean, I think finding it is just annoying, but it's not the end of the world. So let's just start there. I mean, it's funny because every under other industry has figured out how to solve friction as the opportunity of the next business opportunity. You know, whether it's Uber or Amazon or anything. But sports rights don't allow for that, because obviously the fragmentation is because where is is money for us?

00:26:25:37 - 00:27:01:43
不明
Not like, hey, what's the best for a viewer? That's for the viewers, like turn on and who knows? And I'm a Knicks fan and it plays the Knicks like that's the best. But the reality is you find it and you know, like we worked with the NFL on the NFL app. The reality is like those touch points, whether it's through app relationships where you can consolidate many different type of experiences and anticipate what a fan wants and deliver those experiences to that fan to make it easier around the viewing experiences, like the live viewing experiences, there's elements like that, but remember, fandom is not linear anymore.

00:27:01:47 - 00:27:21:29
不明
I mean, there are linear moments. Of course it doesn't take away without the linear moment. There is no sports, but actually fandom is not restricted to that. It's not limited to that. Fandom is never ending at this point. It doesn't start and stop in a season, doesn't start and stop on the first buzzer to the end buzzer like it is pervasive.

00:27:21:34 - 00:27:41:58
不明
So the way to handle that is to tap into the fandom and the passion to where can be and create those stories and moments like we see even scripted TV or reality TV. I know there's some jokes about reality TV, earlier today, but like, you know, even that would like the Drive to survive kind of template. Like that's one element.

00:27:41:58 - 00:28:09:53
不明
How do you bring stories in. So when you actually because all sports are stories, I mean there's the spontaneous moment of the story, but there's the rivalries, the human stories. It all builds up to that. So I what is better than this incredible internet of Instagram and TikTok and, different platforms where people engage in many different ways where you can tell these stories, engage with audiences, and it's having a cohesive plan that allows that to happen.

00:28:09:53 - 00:28:32:56
不明
That's the connection more so than like, oh, it would be great if everybody was on NBC sports. That would be good too. I you I do have a question though. So when you talk about you're saying like it's non-linear for the fan experience. But and I think Camille can attest to this, I won't speak for them, but now it's like it's it's super invasive on the athlete, right?

00:28:32:56 - 00:28:55:46
不明
It's like they cover you. They walk as soon as you get out the car, into the tunnel, in the locker room. Pre-game, post-game, your media post, post-game, the next day shootaround. And then there's all these different things, and it's like the fan wants more and engagement and more, but yet we're all more disconnected than ever. So how are we getting we're having more content, but it's oversaturated because it's just content.

00:28:55:51 - 00:29:18:00
不明
How what's the balance of that? And it's like you want to grow the fandom, but at the same time, like tell a real story when there's a real story, not just the camera. To have the camera. Yeah. Well, I think you're getting first to the point where the internet sucks. So we're going back there a little. Look, I think that.

00:29:18:05 - 00:29:42:37
不明
Just like a brand, a brand has brand safety, brand values. They have restraints. Things that they do. You know, you can use a Coke can in a certain way on an ad. And I think that that you have to live within the constructs that that are reasonable, obviously, like, you know, you can't have a 24/7 reality show on you all the time.

00:29:42:37 - 00:30:01:47
不明
And that's not even what people really want. They want the they want it actually. Packaged up in the way that they are engaging. So I don't know the exact answer if there is an answer, because obviously people want more and more and the leagues and the the teams and even some of the athletes will feed it as much as possible.

00:30:01:53 - 00:30:19:03
不明
So you are you are competing against the competition that someone else will give it. And if you don't give it, but at the end of the day, it's like there's different. Everybody doesn't have to do it the same way. Like that's the myth. Every brand shouldn't do it the same way. Every athlete probably shouldn't do it the same way.

00:30:19:08 - 00:30:37:36
不明
You know, you have certain sports, like golf that are reinventing themselves, that are making a transparent. And is that an innovation that you're going to then see even put more pressure on traditional leagues to do more? Maybe. And then that's just an unfortunate. Right? I mean, I don't know if it gets better. I don't know if I'm answering the question.

00:30:37:39 - 00:30:49:30
不明
I do. I think this is actually I, I probably answer the question better. Well, and solution to that. Yeah.

00:30:49:35 - 00:31:08:18
不明
I know like I mean, I don't know about me. I'm the type of person I'm warming up. Like, I don't want the camera right there. I just don't like I'm warming up. I don't want the camera nowhere. I. Accept the reality TV show. I'm really starting reality TV show Naked and Afraid of you guys know? I don't know the answer.

00:31:08:18 - 00:31:30:12
不明
That's, I guess, why I'm. So. I'm asking. You're right that there's got to be some type of, I don't know. Let me think. Well, I think I'll jump in. I think it has to be a little bit more of intentionality on the content that we own. A story is that we actually trying to tell, like if we are, if the story is about catching an athlete coming into the arena, then let's make that the story.

00:31:30:12 - 00:31:49:33
不明
If the story is about catching the athlete in the locker room before the game as catch that story. It shouldn't be as invasive as it is because, everybody is doing it certain ways or different ways because of your point. Nobody is doing it the same way. Everybody has the idea of how to get the consent and how to tell stories.

00:31:49:38 - 00:32:24:39
不明
So it's always gonna be a fine line between an athlete and, and the lines that media or content will cross. At the end of the day, the athlete is there to do work, perform, get ready, go out there and try to win a game with their teammates and those 2.5 hours as the athletes. So anything that these brands or companies do to support that, and it's around that, let's enhance it to the point where it's not so invasive on the athlete, because then the athlete would be more inclined to do more things from a content standpoint, when y'all come to us, we say, okay, now that sounds cool.

00:32:24:39 - 00:32:42:45
不明
We CIA operate. You're not going to be invasive. This camera not going to be there. This is what we're going to do. This is the story that we're actually trying to tell. I think now we in a society where just gather all the content, but there's no way for this content to live. Right? So it's almost just is useless content at the end of the day.

00:32:42:50 - 00:33:06:48
不明
And that's why we see the same sports content that's out there on every avenue, every channel when it comes to talking about sports. So I do think it's a, it's a, it's one hand gotta watch the other. And we have to figure out what is that balance when it comes to, content creation understanding the brand pillars and the brand messages and what they, what they need to do.

00:33:06:53 - 00:33:26:49
不明
And also how can we help as an athlete? So I do think these are all like real issues. And it's so cool to hear the perspective from the athletes. I had a panel yesterday with the president of business operations for the Sacramento Kings, and we toured the Golden One center a few months ago, which was amazing. Like it is like a VIP venue all the way.

00:33:26:54 - 00:33:44:30
不明
But we saw the practice court for the for the athletes, and they have all the cameras and all the AI tech and they're tracking all the shots and I like I actually remember saying, when do the players actually get to practice without like being watched and like be okay to like miss and you're you're nodding. You're like, no, it's it's like it's a lot.

00:33:44:30 - 00:34:07:42
不明
Right? I can imagine. And then even back to that athlete centric content we're seeing when collective bargaining agreements get renegotiated, we're seeing the leagues going and the teams going deeper in the roster in terms of having athletes be on the hook to share their stories, which which is important for awareness of the sport, for growing fandom, from converting casual fans to super fans.

00:34:07:42 - 00:34:38:22
不明
But where is a line drawn from a human perspective of like, okay, this is too much for the athletes. I think this is going to be an ongoing debate and an interesting one. And I think it's really, it's important to have both perspectives. Right. And, and have this evolve. So, yeah, cool stuff. But it isn't like, you know, if you think back to the 90s, you know, before we had all this and you have like on the same team, Michael Jordan and Dennis Rodman, and you can imagine if they had social media now, it wouldn't hurt.

00:34:38:27 - 00:34:59:40
不明
And you and you would say, like, who knows what Dennis Rodman would do it, how he would do it today with that platform at his height of his career. I don't think that would take away from Michael Jordan being the best of all time, doing it a different way and not being as transparent and everything. So that's where I think, like there's probably a place where both can like I agree, it exists.

00:34:59:45 - 00:35:23:08
不明
It's yeah, not to cut you off, but as also as athletes, we have to take responsibility to it. Right? We have to take accountability to say, look, we got to stop fighting. Was was here. It was to come like we got to really be able to understand what's happening here when it comes to content and technology in a, because a lot of times we fight it, we fight what we don't know and what we don't understand.

00:35:23:12 - 00:35:51:21
不明
So I think having more information and being more informative about what this industry is about and how it's actually enhancing the game, as opposed to taking away from the game or leaving the game stagnant. I think when we start talking about analytics for an example, we so sold on analytics, I think analytics. But when it comes to basketball, I don't think it really gives you the full outcome of what that athlete really is and really should be or what he will be.

00:35:51:26 - 00:36:08:32
不明
But I also think that we have to take accountability as an athlete, because this is the society that we're in. We're going to be utilizing technology from here on out, from from near to the end of time. So we don't get down with it. We all get left behind. And then you really going to start seeing angry athletes.

00:36:08:32 - 00:36:28:50
不明
That's out there. Because we going to get so pushed behind that we not going to understand how to utilize this technology in this area. Because AIS moving so fast and we can't we can't keep up with that, you know. You know what the interesting thing is? I don't know if the players unions do this, but like they should be pushing back to say, give me the data to why you want to do this.

00:36:28:54 - 00:36:46:51
不明
And maybe there's prioritization on like effectiveness instead of just everything. To your point. Yeah. There could be say this is effective. This is less effective. So this is where we're going to put the boundaries. We got to talk to the NBA. We're we will be renegotiating next season. So there we go. Yeah there you go. Go be some.

00:36:46:51 - 00:37:26:00
不明
It was worth it for me the players. All right. Let's, let's talk about women's sports because I mean that is another huge topic right now in the sports industry and a really exciting one. So I think one of the one of the reasons among many that women, women's sports is getting so much attention is because the ability for female athletes to really connect, to really connect with fans, and also when you talk about sponsorship, which which really represents huge dollar amounts for, for not only the leagues and the teams, but the athletes themselves, it opens up new sponsorship categories, especially in areas of of beauty and health.

00:37:26:05 - 00:37:48:52
不明
So I'm curious for you, you know, Kelsey, with all of these, sponsorship deals and opportunities coming your way, how like, how are you deciding and staying true to yourself and true to the game? I am so grateful to be in this era of transformation. You know, when I came into the WNBA, it was vastly different than it is now and where it's going.

00:37:48:57 - 00:38:10:08
不明
So I'm super grateful because there's a lot of women that sacrifice a just a ton and pave the way for us to be able to do what we're doing now and continuing to grow. I think for me, I just, I myself on myself, whether I'm on stage, whether I'm backstage, whether I'm working out, doesn't matter. And so if I like, use a product, then I'm aligned with it.

00:38:10:08 - 00:38:28:54
不明
Or a brand like that's a genuine connection and I'll love to be a part of it if they want to have me. And I'll take pride in that. But I'm not going to go outside of myself or do something or, you know, act a certain way or portray myself on social media a certain way, you know, what you see is what you get.

00:38:28:54 - 00:38:58:17
不明
And for me, I think that's pretty much the only way to live. So I, I take a lot of pride in that. And, especially to like, being able to be around a lot of young girls. I think it's tough. We talk about social media in comparison and just where we're at, particularly in young women, having, it's just completely like, irresponsible, a way of, like, the way a female athlete is supposed to look or supposed to, you know, her body type and and all this and that.

00:38:58:17 - 00:39:16:24
不明
And so when I tried to, you know, my boots are on the ground, I go speak to teams or, you know, have relationships with, younger players. I just say, hey, listen, like, tell them what it is, you know? And, it's tough as an athlete, as a female athlete, because you definitely do want to be particularly free.

00:39:16:24 - 00:39:36:34
不明
Me, like, I want to be fit and, but at the same time, like, healthy. And so there's like, this balance that we have, and, I mean, I think, I think it's something that we got to continue to talk about, speak about and, you know, I continue to try to make sure I'm, like, always vocal about just empowering in the confidence in young women.

00:39:36:39 - 00:39:55:46
不明
Too, you don't have to be outside of yourself. Just you who you are. You. Your unique ability is enough. Yeah, well, thank you for being an inspiration. That's that's really awesome. Pamela, let's let's talk about your son a little bit. I know you're you're proud of him. Following in your footsteps, playing at Syracuse, your alma mater.

00:39:55:51 - 00:40:18:57
不明
We always in the building, no matter where we at. So. So you're watching your son follow, some of the same footsteps as you, but, I'm sure things are also a little different for him. With. With technology, with nil. So just curious, like what you've seen, that's that's been different for him on his path. And it's all different.

00:40:19:08 - 00:40:41:33
不明
It's all different. The roles a reverse now I'm retired. He make money. There's you got to pay for dinners and breakfast and road trips and things like that. Now you got to earn that spot. Well, no, it's I've seen over the years just how again, how crazy that industry is or that in Ireland or just it's, it's a very I don't even know what to call it.

00:40:41:38 - 00:41:18:39
不明
Right. It's chaotic in the sense. And if you don't have the right leadership or the right support system around you, you could get lost in the shuffle and you could start going out there taking these handouts and taking these Nil deals, not really understanding what this is really about. Do we not, you know, you act on a 17 year old kid to sign a contract for 250,300, sometimes millions, in a sense not understanding that you still may have to give something back if you don't make it, or if you do make it is you got to read the fine line, you got to read the fine print that's on those actual contracts.

00:41:18:39 - 00:41:40:15
不明
So we were talking about this last night and I yelled, it's almost it's free money because I'm not going to go and give a kid 500 grand to promote my company for as 16, 17 years old, you're not doing nothing funny. You're not, you're not. You know, messing with my bottom line. You're not doing anything. I'm. I can't even promote anything about you to my consumer.

00:41:40:15 - 00:41:58:03
不明
So I'm just giving you 500,000 to say, here, come and get this. And I owe money, which a lot of times. And I truly, I don't want to get this misconstrued. There's people and athletes who really, really need it. And I think they should go and get all the money that they should actually go. They deserve and they should get.

00:41:58:08 - 00:42:16:06
不明
And now, yo, on the flip side of that, if you have aspirations and you believe in yourself and you believe that you're going to make it to the next level, you don't have to take those initial deals right now because the money that you're getting right now, if you put the work in and continue doing what you're doing, that money would be nothing.

00:42:16:20 - 00:42:33:48
不明
You could get the same amount of money, right? So is for me is the an ideal situation is it's a lot difficult because it's hard to navigate knowing that I have a son that's actually dealing with and I and they're trying to get him to understand what to take and what not to take, because all the money is not not good money.

00:42:33:48 - 00:42:56:40
不明
And again, it becomes it's a business now, right? It's almost like a semi-pro league in the in the situation, college sports is like you, you're paying these kids millions of dollars to come play on the team, but then you ask them to go to 830. Science classes like that doesn't really add up. You're not going to tell somebody's 17 year old who's making 500 grand as a freshman.

00:42:56:41 - 00:43:34:00
不明
They go to algebra 101 class at 830 on a Monday. It just doesn't happen. So it it fractures the whole infrastructure and the whole system. So where you start to see innovation and creativity and technology actually starts to implement or seek into the NHL in the business. And it's a is bad. I would say that is bad. But again, on the flip side, I am supportive of those athletes and those families who really need those funds because at the end of the day, if I can go and make $1 million in four years in college, then that's great for me.

00:43:34:00 - 00:44:02:34
不明
Yeah. But also we gotta shift the mindset of how we actually looking at that money because most people are looking for a quick flip. It's like, no, if I could teach my son or anybody, kid, if you make it a million, if you could make $1 million in four years in college, would you do that? Right? And that also changes the mindset of not wanting to go to college and have to leave, or want to leave, or be forced to leave because of some money that you took or something that you did, or you may just not be ready to go to the next level.

00:44:02:34 - 00:44:18:52
不明
So if I'm going to be in college for four years, I'm racking up all the money that I could possibly get in that four years, and then I'll start taking courses to help me understand how to budget this money and how to make this money work. I'll learn all of that on the campus, but let me get my money first.

00:44:18:57 - 00:44:40:00
不明
Yeah, well, hey, your son's lucky to have your perspective and guidance, you know? Yeah. And it's funny, it's also hard because it's other kids. You know, I'm telling my son that perspective. But then I got to tell another kid, like, look, don't you got to go get that money. You got to go get that deal because you don't know if you're going to get that, if you ever going to be able to get the amount of money that you're being offered right now.

00:44:40:00 - 00:45:04:06
不明
So take that anymore and see what happens. Yeah. Yeah. Dan, I'm going to take a risk here and I'm going to bring up the topic du jour. I again, it's, you know, it is so big. And in, you know, here in Adobe, we talk a lot about how AI is improving productivity and being in sports and working with our sports clients.

00:45:04:11 - 00:45:25:45
不明
This solves for a real challenge because sports teams, you know, the operational side, I mean, they're stretched thin and they need help, and they have really big personalization goals. So, so AI is really helping them get there. But we know you have this different perspective on AI and this, this different, vision for the future.

00:45:25:53 - 00:45:51:38
不明
So I just want to revisit this for a second. And either, you know, we can we can talk about that, that vision a little bit more or, you know, I would just love to hear from you like some either case examples that you've worked on or even that you've seen out there that are actually good use cases that we can look to as, like the vision of, of where, you know, companies and businesses should be trying to get to or striving for.

00:45:51:42 - 00:46:15:36
不明
We're here. Here, let me say this. We think right now, the way the internet is, is the way it will always be. We all think that we don't think much about it, which says we think that. And I like to give the example of around 2008, because that was a turning point for, for the media and publishing world.

00:46:15:41 - 00:46:42:48
不明
And before 2008, let's say, 2006, you would say to someone or I would say to someone, go, hey, the internet's like, like going to change the way you consume information. We already had websites then we even had like online, you know, media companies going online. But it wasn't really like in the, you know, the vernacular. You go to someone and say, hey, listen, in one day we're not going to read newspapers anymore.

00:46:42:48 - 00:47:14:43
不明
We're not going to have magazines like, you know, like Sports Illustrated, like we're not going to care about it. And they would say, no fucking way, no way. I love the feeling of this newspaper. Like everybody would say, it was crazy. Then about 2008, there was a recession, there's an economic decline, and you had the rise of like digital first upstarts, like having Post and Vice Media at the time and, BuzzFeed, there was a couple others, and it transformed everything because it was like, oh man, we can deliver in effective ways.

00:47:14:43 - 00:47:40:33
不明
We understand consumers. And it just destroyed the traditional media market. Obviously, advertising dollars went there, so the the money wasn't traditional anyway. And then after 2008, a let's say 2009, you would say, remember newspapers, that's like, oh no, this like it was like already forgotten. I mean, we know about it, but like, it was so obvious to us that now we're going to engage with news, online.

00:47:40:33 - 00:48:10:55
不明
Now, the reason I bring that up, because it's a pretty like, understandable moment of time. And we could all kind of remember before it and couldn't even imagine it afterwards. And now we can imagine a time where the internet was not in our lives. I bring that up because the internet is immature. It's young. If you look at history, what is it like 25, 20, 25 years, maybe 35 years for some of us, like the news in the 90s, but it really wasn't much sense of like, let's say, a quarter of a century of humanity.

00:48:11:00 - 00:48:34:21
不明
The internet has been around and we act like it's like some mature technology that, like, has totally fit. We have figured itself out and it's figured ourselves out, and this is the way it is. And yeah, like you're going to go to a game in 50 years and you're going to see everybody, like with a rectangle in front of your face, like, is that going to happen in 50 years?

00:48:34:26 - 00:48:55:02
不明
Like, probably not 20 years, maybe not ten years, maybe not even not, you know, like, and you just play this out like, I mean, cars are becoming autonomous. I'm not going to have to touch steering wheels. It's going to change into, you know, transportation changes. Engagement changes attention. As an example, like we have AR, AR glasses like different modes, different screens.

00:48:55:13 - 00:49:18:21
不明
So if you just start playing it out, it's very obvious to me like incredibly obvious that it's immature. The way we do things are just not the way they're going to be done. So when we think about sports and live entertainment and like media, well, maybe there's a different way. Maybe we will connect in different ways. Humans connect in different ways with hopefully boundaries to athletes and the teams.

00:49:18:21 - 00:49:40:49
不明
And if you think about like sports specifically was about bringing community together, you came as a community. You rooted for it. It gave you suspense like the films you even the the failures, like, fulfills you because you, like, cried together. And when you had the championship you like. These are like human emotions. I'm going to go back to the emotions thing and like, how could technology really take advantage of it?

00:49:40:58 - 00:50:02:39
不明
And are the things today that we are using really taking advantage of it? I don't think so. I don't even think we're close to that. I will think we will look back in this moment in history and laugh at what we are doing, like literally laughed and like, well, like we'll be like telling our like, grandkids. Oh, when I was a kid, like, we had this thing and we fucking sat there and like, it's going to be like that.

00:50:02:41 - 00:50:24:48
不明
Yeah, yeah. I mean, hey, technology's certainly going to give us more options. It is giving us more options. And just understanding, you know, preferences, fan preferences, customer preferences. I mean, for me, like, I don't see myself being at a WNBA game with, like, a big thing on my head, like, anytime soon, but like the newspaper. Yeah, let's say you have like 26.

00:50:25:02 - 00:50:40:44
不明
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah. We'll see, we'll see. I could change my mind, but, but I do think, you know, like I said, people people are preferences. And there is this element of connection, you know, and live and you know, but the reality is a lot of fans will never step foot in the arena and have that opportunity.

00:50:40:44 - 00:51:09:36
不明
So technology is really bridging that gap for the at home fan, the millions of fans around the world. So that certainly is exciting. So, something to keep an eye on. Yeah. I feel like this is the golden age of creativity. I mean, like at a next level. Now we finally have the technology to, like, come up with new ideas, like, like really transformative ideas to drive connections in all the things that enriches.

00:51:09:41 - 00:51:24:44
不明
We were promised, like flying cars by now, like, you know, in like, the 80s, it's like literally like back to the future to where, like flying cars, you know, it's like. And to your point, like all we got was like, you know, where is my like, how do I watch the next game on like 30 streaming channels? Yeah.

00:51:24:46 - 00:51:46:22
不明
Like so like and now we have like AI and it's like, oh my God. It's like we can do crazy shit. And everybody's like, nervous for their jobs. And like, if it's that good, that means it's that good. That means we could do some crazy, amazing stuff and we can really figure out what humans want. And if I'm a brand, if I'm an athlete, if I'm a sports team, if I'm a league, I'm like, what do they what can I deliver?

00:51:46:33 - 00:52:06:30
不明
Exceptionally, that doesn't look like today that like really transforms it. And the only limitation is in the technology. It's just creativity. It's the only limitation right now. And you got to start with like asking some right questions and coming up with some good ideas and then, you know, figuring out the technology to solve it and not reversing that.

00:52:06:30 - 00:52:30:50
不明
I love that it's an exciting time for sure. Let's talk about, calcium Carmelo, maybe some exciting ways you're currently engaging with technology. Carmelo I know you have a digital twin. Let's hear about that. Yeah. It was again, it's to your point about, you know, being creative is like really understanding where industries are going. And I think me and my team did a great job with just identifying at it.

00:52:30:55 - 00:52:51:28
不明
You know, at a point in time where it's like, this is where it's going. Like, you know, it's like hanging out with them last night. No, no, no, that was like that was a real deal. We ain't get to those blurred lines and we don't know if we real or not. But with the digital twin, it was just more of a creative way for me to enhance my brand and bring a dude a new avenue, you know, to my brand.

00:52:51:28 - 00:53:07:38
不明
And, you know, it's like it's like teaching and it's like, you know, kind of raising a kid in this sense is like the more that you feed the digital at the digital twin, the smarter it gets to the point where it can hold conversations with people. You ask them something, it's going to hold a real conversation with you.

00:53:07:38 - 00:53:31:40
不明
So through AI and technology, it is starting to enhance all the features and and how quick the response is, is, you know, it's coming back and forth, but also being able to have real conversations with my with a digital twin and and getting real, live, factual, real events, real facts about whether it's me, whether it's about just whatever industry it is for me.

00:53:31:40 - 00:53:56:18
不明
That was fun. I was totally leftfield and I was amazing when people were zagging and I really had to understand what this could possibly be, right? So if I can't be in every place at one point at one time. So if my if a brand needs me in, in China and I got to be over here in the US, I can actually send my digital twin over, over there to, to China to promote the same branding.

00:53:56:20 - 00:54:15:06
不明
Right. So he he would have the same information and I would have the same intelligence and we would continue to grow that. But that's also the brands have to be creative enough to understand how we can utilize both of these media and reality. And my actual digital twin, I love that you delegate to your digital twin. That's amazing.

00:54:15:06 - 00:54:34:18
不明
Yeah, it's my my digital. I talk to it, you know, I want my kids be thinking on where sometimes is sitting on a computer talking to my digital twin. They be like, yeah, what do you think is being friends with me? And I tell them, you guys, within a couple years, you guys are going to be talking to my digital twin, asking things about you, taxing things about you.

00:54:34:26 - 00:54:58:08
不明
Yeah, yeah. Kelsey, do you see yourself having a digital twin? I can't follow that one. I don't have to listen. So I was saying, I will make one for you. We've got a good one. So we got technology. All the things you don't want to do. You have a digital twin to do. That's your solution. Okay. Deal. What's what's maybe another way besides a digital twin that you like to engage with technology or you see yourself engaging with technology in the future.

00:54:58:13 - 00:55:20:39
不明
I mean, just like as an athlete, we kind of talked about it earlier, but using like advanced analytics and metrics to help your performance. Just like in my training, strength training and then also on the court, just knowing like, like Kamala was talking about earlier on on a different, panel, but, you know, spots like, oh, you shoot 60% from this corner, 27% from this elbow.

00:55:20:39 - 00:55:37:06
不明
Like it's just kind of knowing, you know, what you're great at and then what you can get better at. That's helped me as an athlete. Even game to game, just understanding like okay. Like, or if you're playing in a specific match up and there's a team that's like, hey, they give a lot like to, you know, they ice ball screen.

00:55:37:06 - 00:56:01:42
不明
So you're going to be able to get downhill and like just tendencies. But advanced analytics picks that stuff up. And if you study it and you study the games, you have to pick up patterns. And I think that can help you as a player. Yeah, that's that's interesting. And I've actually been personally curious, with all of the advancements in the biometric tracking for, for people and athletes, like, as athletes, I know you're so in tune with your body, right.

00:56:01:42 - 00:56:24:18
不明
And and recovery and how you feel. Have you been, surprised maybe by some of the feedback of like, biometrics or tracking? And are you finding that useful I guess, or do you think it still needs to get a little bit more sophisticated for it to be truly helpful? Absolutely. I like I noticed direct trends between the amount I sleep and then my VO2 max the next day.

00:56:24:22 - 00:56:44:05
不明
Or, maybe if I'm on my period and my energy levels. And it just kind of can tell you, you know, things to like patterns. Can we talk about pattern recognition? I feel like, you know, I is the best at being able to pick that up and tell you even beforehand. So it's like shortening the time of you having to figure it out on your own.

00:56:44:12 - 00:57:03:07
不明
You know, it's like trial and error, trial and error. And, that's that's helped a ton. You know, I've been in the best shape I've been in, in my career, and I credit that a lot to just being smarter with my training. And that's because of having metrics and understanding why I'm doing something, how much to do it, how long to do it for.

00:57:03:12 - 00:57:27:24
不明
And in turn, I think you better results. Yeah. Cool. Good to hear. Okay. We're, we're running out of time. One one last question. For for all three of you, we talked about, you know, technology is changing at, like, a crazy rapid pace. The world of sports is evolving. You know, at the end of the day, we want to try to bring fans closer to the action on the court.

00:57:27:37 - 00:57:50:09
不明
And we talked a little bit about that in-person experience versus the experience for the at home fan, like around the world. Like, I'm curious what maybe is one example or one thing you're excited about for just, bringing fans closer to the action and really improving that fan engagement for sports and just growing the overall world of sports.

00:57:50:14 - 00:58:06:40
不明
Save us, Dan. I mean, oh, I look, there's so many different ways you could go at this. I mean, like you mentioned before, like the fan that can't get to the game and can we make it. So they're sitting next to Melo at the Knicks game like that. That's cool. That's cool. How could that not be cool. Or your digital twin.

00:58:06:40 - 00:58:31:45
不明
Don't worry one of us would be there. Yeah. You know like stuff like that. But like, you know, today there's like cool. Technical technology that's like enable. What I like to say is like, like stack. Well, has this, product called, around and it's, it enables an AR experience in stadium. So it's like, to me, it's like modernizing you know, what was traditionally the program in a way that feels very engaging.

00:58:31:45 - 00:58:52:28
不明
So it brings kids in in a way so they're not on separate experiences like in the stadium. It actually reengaging them back to actually the game, even if it has like some extensions. So this things like that, I think that, we're at this point where the hardware is now starting to catch up to the software because now with AI we have great software.

00:58:52:33 - 00:59:09:49
不明
But the hardware is a limitation to your, you know, to your point, I think you don't want to put the thing on your head, but it's like getting to the point where, like, if it's quite invisible but brings you back into a moment where you're alive again and your heads are up and you're present. To me, that's the technology that excites me most.

00:59:09:49 - 00:59:28:30
不明
Like, how do we become present that facilitates our relationships as a fan, you know, as a community within fandom, like all those things. I think there's so much stuff happening right now that, in 40s, there's no way I could, I could, really articulate it. Yeah. Now. Well, I think you did a great job. Thank you.

00:59:28:34 - 00:59:43:03
不明
And, the buzzer is about to go off. Unless you guys have a final. I'm going to take the last second shot. Last second shot. Now I'm just giving it to me. Oh, no. I mean, when I take the. When I take it when it's already me. Yeah, you know what I mean. No. Hey, you know what?

00:59:43:04 - 01:00:01:31
不明
One thing. Yeah, one thing is for sure. You know, sports is so core to our culture to to happiness. And I think, and community and so, you know, thank you guys for what you do and sports and the business of sports. And we know you're busy. We know you have to jet on a flight like literally right now.

01:00:01:31 - 01:00:12:31
不明
So so just thank you for this panel. It was super fun. I think everybody in the audience enjoyed it. And we appreciate you. Thank you guys. Thank you.

01:00:12:36 - 01:00:13:01
不明
For.
