Welcome. My name is Laura de Ferial, and I've had the pleasure of working at Adobe for, I'll admit it, over 25 years, and I've been working on that for about the whole time in different functions. Rebecca. Hi, everyone. I'm Rebecca Gasser, I'm from FGS global. I'm the chief information officer. FGS global is a strategic communications consultancy.

00:00:23:58 - 00:00:51:13
不明
We help our clients lead, influence and win in their most decisive moments. Okay. So ideas come from everywhere, right? And it's always been the core of the human process. They fuel, innovation, drive, change things, create things. And Victor Hugo, this is a quote from him said, nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come. Now, for businesses, breakthrough ideas can be a game changer, right?

00:00:51:18 - 00:01:20:35
不明
A new it's a new solution that disrupts the industry. A brilliant concept that goes viral, or an approach to modern, applications modernizing your, operations. The value, though, of the ideas isn't just found in these breakthrough ideas, but sometimes in the everyday things that we do. And it can be these small, practical ideas that really can be make a difference in our, business and processes, in moving business forward.

00:01:20:40 - 00:01:41:55
不明
I'm very fond of clicking and swiping at the same time. All right. So ideas are the currency of business value. And I'll talk a little bit about what where digital documents are in the idea of currency. But they're the currency of business value. And whether you're creating the content or solving a customer problem or recommendations and contribute to large things every day.

00:01:42:00 - 00:02:06:22
不明
But how many of these thoughts really turn into actionable items and actionable ID actionable ideas, and more importantly, how are those turned into business impact for your business? Right? And at the end of the day, it's not just about the great ideas, but it's about discover and discovering and developing and delivering them faster and more efficiently.

00:02:06:27 - 00:02:35:47
不明
Shantanu mentioned this morning in the keynote that documents are the language of business. Trillions of PDFs are out there in the world today. Digital documents are the lifeblood that flow through your organization. It doesn't matter what department you're in, what your role is in, or regardless of your industry. But there's untapped value in your digital documents today. Believe it or not, 80 to 90% of data that's out there today.

00:02:35:47 - 00:02:58:43
不明
What you guys probably know this is unstructured, right? It's all over the place, right? And in fact, Forrester estimates that point 5%. Yeah. Like not even 1% of data is ever even analyzed or worked on. And in a report from PwC, they believe that there's a momentous opportunity to tap into this information. I'm going to read the quote, so please excuse me for reading.

00:02:58:48 - 00:03:25:46
不明
Jenny. I can help you turn more data into more value, more quickly. Data that's trapped in presentations, strategy papers, customer logs, and countless other documents that define your organization. I believe the day AI opens up new opportunities to help with document productivity. So everybody in your business can consume and understand information across documentation faster because that's really the goal, right?

00:03:25:48 - 00:03:49:28
不明
That's what I see. Helping us is to get things done in a more efficient way. Instead of manually searching through documents for key information. I can extract those insights for us. And with AI, we can become a lot more productive when we're working with digital documents. Okay, so the goal is to shorten the gap between ideas and impact.

00:03:49:33 - 00:04:08:39
不明
And for most people, the path for coming up with a good idea to make a good business impact takes a lot of time and a lot of effort. It starts with trying to gather and review all the information, to think about what you're trying to do across multiple documents. It could be reports, it could be presentations, market research and data, just whatever.

00:04:08:43 - 00:04:35:40
不明
And of course, that takes countless hours to holy and consume and think about that. And then, when you're trying to synthesize it, that takes a little bit of time too, because you're oh, what did that one say? I got to go back and compare and contrast. So here's another data point for you. The average knowledge worker spends over eight hours each week either recreating, duplicating or reusing their, expertise.

00:04:35:40 - 00:04:58:07
不明
So there's we got to try to get rid of trying to do all this duplicative work. And all of this allows us to streamline from ideas to impact. Okay, so let's break this down. There's three stages to the ideation lifecycle. The first one is to discover ideas. The second is to, excuse me, develop ideas. And of course, the third one is to deliver the ideas.

00:04:58:12 - 00:05:17:03
不明
All right, I oops, I forgot to. Sorry. Here we go. You pay for kind of a slice slice on both sides. Excuse me. So Acrobat really enables you to bring this life cycle. You want to sleep? Swipe for me. Oh, you're such a sweetheart. Here we go. Okay. All right. Bring the life. Excuse me. Bring the ideation life cycle to life.

00:05:17:07 - 00:05:42:00
不明
So if you think about the three stages, what about Discover the discover phase? Acrobat really helps you idea discover by digging into documents, getting insights from the documents more quickly. If you think about the second one, develop, we have an attribution engine. I'll show you in a few minutes. That really helps you understand where the document in the information was sourced from, and so you can verify and have more confidence in the output that you're working with.

00:05:42:10 - 00:06:04:31
不明
And then for that, deliver part of the thing. Acrobat can help you generate derivatives to help with your ideation results. Okay. All right. So I do want to mention this. This is a little bit of a PSA from my point of view that I feel like a key element to working with generative AI is to craft a good or possibly great prompt first to get the best results.

00:06:04:31 - 00:06:26:13
不明
And prompts can be simple or complex, but I want to break this down. So here's a great way to think about the task. Is the first component to help them help assistant know what I'm trying to do? Create a product feedback summary. Okay, so now we know what we're trying to do. The context is the second component to help ensure that I respond appropriately based on recent customer reviews.

00:06:26:18 - 00:06:49:14
不明
The third piece, expectations that really compose the response goals. What are we trying to go? It should identify key themes, overall sentiment and recurring issues or praise. And finally, what how do you want to format it? And in this case, format the summary to be concise and present information in a clear and easy to understand manner suitable for a marketing team meeting.

00:06:49:19 - 00:07:06:41
不明
Okay, I'm ready to do a demo. We're going to try to turn this over and hopefully all will be well in the digital world here. So has everybody seen the latest version of Acrobat? I don't know if you have have it, but this is the latest UI. And what you see here is the very first tool. Right here at the top is the AI assistant.

00:07:06:41 - 00:07:24:18
不明
And you can say select files. Now what I'm going to start with is I want to start with, give me a second here. Everything kind of get moved around two files I, I'm a marketer and I'm trying to put together a campaign, and I need a little bit of help and I'm going to get some research. Now I'm going to grab these two files.

00:07:24:23 - 00:07:43:32
不明
One is an FAQ and one is the pricing plan for this product called Alterra Stock. As you can see, one is a PDF and one is a word file. It doesn't matter what file format it is, it can be word, Excel, PowerPoint, text, HTML, meaning it's all these different file formats. They all work fine. You can just bring them right in.

00:07:43:37 - 00:08:04:52
不明
So I'll start in the acrobat and I'll say select files and I'll go back to that folder and I'll grab those two files. Now I actually did this ahead of time just to save time. But I want to show you what's happening. And then we can jump to the baked cake version if you want. Which you'll notice in the lower right hand corner is Acrobat is opening and consuming those two files.

00:08:04:57 - 00:08:22:13
不明
And you'll notice the word file actually is going to be converted from word to PDF on the fly. And you can see the clock is moving and it's doing its thing right. All right. We're going to jump ahead just so that we can I guess I got to wait for it to catch up with, All right. Oh there we go.

00:08:22:15 - 00:08:39:16
不明
We got one open and then a second. So here's what it looks like. And then assistant will start processing that information. Just trying to understand it. Trying to analyze it and be prepped to generate output. So I'm just going to stop that right now. We'll go over and use the one that I already built. So here's my two files.

00:08:39:21 - 00:08:57:04
不明
Every time Acrobat opens up it and does AI assistant, it offers you three sample questions just to kind of get your brain moving. If you're not sure what you want to do, however, you can go ahead and add your own things. Now I'm going to show you the man behind the curtain is I have all my prompts in a word file so that I don't have to type them out.

00:08:57:09 - 00:09:19:37
不明
So the first thing I'm going to do for this one is I'm going to say create a summary of each of the benefits of this technology and why it's beneficial. Now, what's really cool about this is we will be able to do this. Give it a moment. Okay. And here's the results. It's in a tab bullet format. It's easy for me to see these benefits.

00:09:19:42 - 00:09:37:17
不明
And what you'll notice here I'm just going to drag this out just a tiny bit I'll start it talking about it. You'll see there's these. And here's this table these attributions. Now this is what takes me back. I click it and I go right back to the file. Remember I had two files that I used in this file.

00:09:37:26 - 00:09:56:42
不明
This is where that answer came from. And in Acrobat as I mentioned you can have I've got the two files in the collection. I can add up to ten files total to analyze at the same time. So each of these takes me and you'll notice as I roll over, it shows me which document the answer came from, in this case, the pricing plan.

00:09:56:47 - 00:10:20:04
不明
And it takes me right back to the document and shows me the answer. Okay, so that's example. No, I think I had one more. Oh yes. So the first part was I was trying to discover learn a little bit about the technology, but now I'd like Acrobat to suggest topics for a five part webinar series. I could say suggest taglines for my new campaign.

00:10:20:09 - 00:10:44:55
不明
I could say all sorts of different things along those lines that make the most sense. Forget about me. All right? Okay. And you can see it brings them all up right here. All right. The most. And again, all the attributions are there always. We always have the attributions posted as well. All right. The next thing I wanted to talk about was the, digital.

00:10:45:00 - 00:11:16:30
不明
There it is. I'm sure you're probably familiar. Adobe produces every year something called the, digital index, the digital trends. Right. The AI digital trends. And last year and for all the years previous, we posted it on adobe.com as a PDF. This year, we actually posted it as an HTML file. And here it is. The digital trends. Now, I don't know if any of you are aware this, but again, if you come upon HTML content and you'd like to do the same analysis that we were doing, an acrobat, if you have the Acrobat extension installed, you can just say convert web page to PDF.

00:11:16:44 - 00:11:36:10
不明
And that will do, you know, just make a PDF that then you can then throw into Acrobat. So let's go back to Acrobat. And here it is somewhere here okay. So this is it. Turned it into a 36 page PDF. And it's got all of the information that was on that website and I can start querying this now.

00:11:36:10 - 00:11:53:16
不明
One other thing I wanted to mention here was, and I'll let it do this for a second, in addition to the AI assistant tool, we have another view here that summarizes the document as well for me. So I'm going to let that summary keep going and I'll jump back to that in a minute. So again it's offering me do I want to understand.

00:11:53:16 - 00:12:16:07
不明
Do I want to analyze or do I want to generate. What am I trying to do with this document today. And again, I'm going to go back to my cheat sheet. And the thing is I'm not you know, if you click here and you say search for agnostic, you'll see it's in there 13 times and I could click it and I could jump to each version of where the word magnetic is in the document, and try to read about it in the context of the page.

00:12:16:12 - 00:12:40:23
不明
But with AI system, I can ask the question to compare and contrast maybe magnetic AI and generative AI, right? So again, I'm this may be a new topic to me or I'm not really sure the differences and I'm not sure I can actually have Acrobat help me figure out the difference between the two of those. As I mentioned, the other thing we have here is a couple still generating, the other tool.

00:12:40:28 - 00:12:59:49
不明
Okay, well, we'll wait that to go. I'll just keep going back here. So remember when I was showing in the slides how to break down a prompt. You know, the four steps task expectations context and thing I have, a format. Excuse me, I have one right here. And it's it's long like that. I need a blog post.

00:12:59:54 - 00:13:23:39
不明
I need it to be this long. I needed to have this this tone. And I want it to be read continuously without headings and again, Acrobat will give me an example that I can use with attributions. Of course I can check each one of those, but the thing I love about this is at the very bottom there's a copy button, and I could click copy right now, and I'd have my first draft of my blog post.

00:13:23:43 - 00:13:44:52
不明
One of the thing I just wanted to mention briefly is we do have a prompt guide, and I'm it's up on adobe.com and it's it's a great opportunity. There's a PDF version that is organized by your role, the marketing kind of marketing, sample code prompts and engineering once and then as well as organized by, topic.

00:13:44:52 - 00:14:02:51
不明
I need to ask questions, I need to brainstorm and so on and so on. All right. So that got us to there to think. So okay. So that was two three. So all right I know all of us are in meetings every day. And many times our meetings are recorded and we get a transcript. And I think this is really important because then I might have missed the meeting.

00:14:02:51 - 00:14:29:01
不明
Or I want to understand where the meeting makes the most sense to me if I was there or I wasn't there. And the third type of file that I want to talk about is, a context of a transcript. So, right here, I have the ability to integrate directly with, teams so that all the meetings that we use teams at Adobe, that I can go to all my meetings, that it was in teams, and it will automatically summarize them and everything for me there.

00:14:29:06 - 00:14:49:17
不明
Or I can open up what's called a VTT file, and I can just go ahead and say create, pick the file. And in my folder I have, a VTT file here and it will go ahead and consume it and open it and do the analysis on it immediately. And so I have a version here which I think has already been analyzed.

00:14:49:17 - 00:15:10:59
不明
Nope. Let's go over here. I want to just try to save some time on this so we can get back to the slides. Oh boy. There it is. So when you take a look at it here, it summarizes the meeting. And then it also at the bottom gives you the next steps. And it also calls out who's has responsibility for the next steps.

00:15:11:04 - 00:15:35:52
不明
But the thing I love about assistant versus maybe other tools on that market that will summarize your meeting transcripts is the ability to say, I want to ask I assistant the things I care about in this meeting. So again I'm going to go back to my prompts. I can ask about it. Or in this case you generate an email to send it to my team members so they don't have to read the summary.

00:15:35:52 - 00:15:53:26
不明
They don't have to do the work. I'll do it for them. It'll go ahead and it'll find that, thing. And again, you'll notice it's formatted like an email. Dear team, you know, here's all the things. And again at the bottom, of course, I could copy this and it'd be my draft to get me started with the email.

00:15:53:31 - 00:16:23:40
不明
The next thing I wanted to talk about was, multi languages. And I know, some of us are, you know, English isn't our native language or vice versa. English is my native language, and I don't speak or read any other language. So this document that I have up on the screen is in German. And you'll notice when I, bring it up the the height, the titles here are in German, but when I click on it, it's already it converts it to English because my computer's set to American English and my acrobat is set to American English.

00:16:23:40 - 00:16:46:50
不明
So Acrobat knows away and I'll just show her everything in English. Same thing is true if I ask a question what are the, you know, sustainability? It gives me the answers in English. So vice versa. If you come upon English documents and you have, you know, you want to ask in French or German or Japanese, you can do that and it will bring your answer back in the native language that you're more comfortable working with.

00:16:46:55 - 00:17:04:33
不明
All right. I had one last thing I wanted to cover very quickly, and that's contracts. How many of us have to look at contracts? I mean, whether it's a sales contract or a vendor contract or whatever. So I'm going to show you right here what I did was I have a wireless contract because all of us have a cell phone.

00:17:04:33 - 00:17:21:52
不明
Right. And this is seven point type, 12 pages long. And I'm telling you, I've never really read through my cell contracts, but there's so many other contracts in our life. And so the thing that Acrobat does that I absolutely love, because it gives you a summary of what's in the contract, what's the start date, what's the end date, what's the terms.

00:17:22:06 - 00:17:42:10
不明
And again, with the attributions. Right. Of course you can go right back in and confirm that that information matches what you want. And as I mentioned you can ask it questions if you need to. In this case I said list the key terms and it shows me the terms as well. Now the second thing you can do is I combined, in this case, two wireless agreements.

00:17:42:10 - 00:17:59:48
不明
I've got my city signal mine and I'm thinking about changing carriers. So I went and grabbed theirs. And here's where I can go ahead and start asking it questions about different things about the document. So I've got the key terms. But then I asked it and I did this earlier. So I just want to be honest with you.

00:17:59:52 - 00:18:21:43
不明
I said compare the monthly and roaming rates for each contract and put it in a table for me to make it easier for me to read. And what you'll notice is it does do this side by side comparison. So I don't know how long that would have taken me without I assistant. I have to have them side by side, highlighted, maybe with a marker or copy pasting into Excel so that I could see everything.

00:18:21:48 - 00:18:41:57
不明
And then it gives me some details which I love, and then it summarizes it and it says it's higher because it has the cost of the plan plus the device. So it's like giving me some oh yeah, that's why that costs more. The iPhone's added into it. So again is I could copy this, I could paste it into Excel, into word or even into email or whatever I wanted to do with it.

00:18:42:01 - 00:19:03:10
不明
So with that, Rebecca, what about for you? I would talk to me about contracts or what are your thoughts about this? Yeah. So this is one that I was really excited for her to demo to everybody because I live and breathe in a lot of contracts, and we don't have a contract lifecycle management system. So we have a, you know, a file share full of contracts.

00:19:03:10 - 00:19:21:43
不明
We're constantly opening them, digging through the information. It's not well, it's well organized, but you can't get to the information unless you actually go into it. So this is something I use very regularly myself. And a lot of people across the company are now opening up contracts and very quickly getting to the information that they need. Yeah. Great.

00:19:21:43 - 00:19:41:21
不明
Well all right, how about we move on to, there's different ways to put your marketing documents and actions and, market research, competitive bidding. Also think of all the different types of documents that all work inside of Acrobat. So Rebecca, I'll hand it over to you and, you can go ahead and talk through your slides. Okay.

00:19:41:25 - 00:20:01:50
不明
Oh, it's in the wrong order. It's fine. Okay. Go ahead. Well, we'll go with this. All right, so we I brought two use cases to you, and there's, there's many more as we start to use this more and more across our firm. One of them is for our consultants, they spend a lot of time, they get a new mandate from a client.

00:20:01:55 - 00:20:23:22
不明
For this use case, we're talking about reputation. We need to understand the reputation and the sentiment of of a particular client and the amount of time it takes to collect all that information and then analyze it is extensive. And really the analyzing, we have a lot of associates spending time trying to put it all together and provide that to our partners.

00:20:23:27 - 00:20:47:55
不明
So with, I'll move over to here. Yeah. So with with the AI assistant, we can take that information together, put it into Acrobat, and start to ask questions about what the themes are coming out and taking us to the most important information through the attributes to, quickly get to the content that we need to start to create a summary of what we want.

00:20:48:00 - 00:21:13:41
不明
So we once we have all the information together, we go into, the develop phase. Right? And so this is where we can start to gauge that sentiment, understand what's the most important things, start to identify those key points and start to draft communications right there in that in that program to start to respond to the client on on what we want to say.

00:21:13:46 - 00:21:33:21
不明
And so doing this, I mean, I'm sure you can imagine the amount of time we're cutting down by getting that analytics, by using AI to get us to that information faster. There's a lot of noise in the system, and that starts to take some of that noise out for us. That attribution quickly getting to why is it saying this?

00:21:33:21 - 00:21:55:52
不明
Why does it think that this is the sentiment? We can very quickly click across all the multiple sources to to start to read all the information that we need to. And what this doesn't do is replace the need for our consultants to become experts in that information, but it gets them to that information faster so they can digest it and start to formulate what they're going to tell their clients.

00:21:55:57 - 00:22:28:13
不明
And so and then again, you can take that and start to draft communications with specific tones, formats, length, all that great stuff across. So that's one use case. And then the second one we were originally going to flip these once we realized the last piece of the demo would be legal. But but this is where, the I'd say the most excitement in our firm, which is a little bit boring, but, in our legal and contract space and we do over 2000 contracts a year, both for clients and for vendors.

00:22:28:13 - 00:22:47:58
不明
And so we spend a lot of time in these PDFs trying to read through things, trying to read line things. And we don't have really good tech for that yet. So with this, we were able to take for this particular use case, we're taking, two contracts and I did this the other day myself. I get something in DocuSign.

00:22:47:58 - 00:23:05:19
不明
I go back to what, the final red line version and make sure they match. Right. You can't just trust, but you can take these documents and start to understand the differences between the two contracts. But we hope for the best.

00:23:05:24 - 00:23:31:32
不明
We're going to get through this. But you can quickly start to get to, the differences between the two contracts. You can start to see where a client might have changed some terms, and you can use the I assistant to help you draft new responses. So that's like when we get into the develop, it can start to have to help you draft the response back on why you might not accept those terms, or how you might be able to meet in the middle for them.

00:23:31:37 - 00:23:58:30
不明
And like I said, this is something that I personally use a lot. If we can use it in our consultancy, you know, the partners who are actually negotiate it and the legal team. So, that's really exciting for us. And I think we covered that. Yes. And so, I mean, this is the obvious, right? So it's going to allow us, all of our users to be more efficient, handle these requests, respond a little bit faster.

00:23:58:35 - 00:24:23:31
