Hello. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. My name is Sunil man, and I lead product marketing for Adobe's customer journey management portfolio. Adobe's digital experience business is a B2B business, right? And so I'm really excited to host a session focused on B2B reimagination. I want to thank the summit team and my extended team for pouring their hearts into this event.

00:00:22:01 - 00:00:47:05
不明
They did such an incredible job. This morning you heard an inspiring story from Colin Fleming, the CMO of ServiceNow, and from I'm at the Hoja on the evolution of B2B. We're going to continue that narrative today and hear from customers like Sandra Brill from Nvidia. These incredible brands, like many of you, are pushing the boundaries of the market and are bold enough to disrupt the status quo.

00:00:47:07 - 00:01:13:13
不明
So let's dive in. So earlier today, when I laid the case for B2B Treat Auto, he described how the forces of modern customer experiences and I have revolutionized the market. To recap, he described one oh as digitizing the customer record. Auto was about automating your lead funnel and three auto being the future, focused on intelligently orchestrating the entire customer lifecycle.

00:01:13:15 - 00:01:42:27
不明
A world where customers dictate when, where and how they want to engage with the brand and you help guide them. B2B treat auto immerses your customers and your teams with digital experiences. It's layered with AI, but it does not replace human relationships. It supercharges them, and each generation builds on the last. And the innovations that define a new generation helps reimagine the previous one.

00:01:43:00 - 00:02:13:22
不明
It reminds me of the evolution of GPS. I still remember the radical invention of the handheld GPS in my car. No more printing directions. Turn by turn. Digital directions. I still got lost. But let's say that was GPS 1.0. 2.0 was the mobile app on my iPhone. Real time rerouting with traffic. And this even spawned $1 billion industries like ridesharing and delivery companies.

00:02:13:25 - 00:02:36:22
不明
Fleet auto it's all the driver assist technology we see in our cars leading up to self-driving. It's not just about automating driving. It completely reimagines how we think of the driving experience. Even for those that are not comfortable with full self-driving, there are a ton of new innovations in the car today, creating this incredible experience for the driver.

00:02:36:24 - 00:03:03:02
不明
Now, something as advanced as autonomous driving isn't just an incremental improvement, it's a fundamental leap forward in technology across multiple areas. I knew chips, computer vision, lidar, data processing, all of this coming together as a platform. And the first time I experienced self-driving. I will admit I was nervous, but it also amazed me to see how far we've come.

00:03:03:04 - 00:03:31:22
不明
In less than a decade. So you must be wondering, what does this have to do with me as a B2B marketer, as a salesperson, or as the Customer Success manager? I'm here to say that we're at the cusp of this same kind of leap forward in technology, in our space. And that's what really is all about technology components like a real time a control file, an advanced radar system for interpreting massive amounts of computer and customer data.

00:03:31:24 - 00:04:00:23
不明
It's technologies like generative creative copy, sort of computer vision for assembling images and words. And you all know text volumes of carefully placed messaging to educate B2B buyers. If we could use these advanced systems to understand what buyers are looking for and place them in just the right experiences, at the right time, at the right place. That's a massive leap forward towards driving relationships at scale.

00:04:00:26 - 00:04:28:29
不明
Genii, large language models, conversational AI are all fueling this leap forward in technology because they allow more mainstream and accessible. You can point them directly at your most complex processes, or even your most mundane ones. If you can feed it just the right messaging and creative with enough volume and guardrails, it can make driving your business an incredible experience for you and for your customers.

00:04:29:02 - 00:04:57:09
不明
This era of AI is electrifying because it's a force multiplier for valuable relationships fueled by informed decisions. That's a lot. Let's unpack this. Starting with customer data. In B2B, as we know, data is wildly complex. The top of the funnel is a mix of both anonymous and known customers. Each person creating hundreds of signals over months and full accounts can generate thousands of these signals.

00:04:57:11 - 00:05:20:19
不明
With everything moving more digital, the aperture and the context of the data looks vastly different than it was even a few years ago. So much of the buyer research is happening independently, well before they even talk to a salesperson at a company. And if this research keeps bringing them back to your website or they attend a webinar or an event, it's very likely that you're on their shortlist.

00:05:20:22 - 00:05:45:18
不明
That first party behavior is so rich with intent. So why not build sensors to capture it and reroute them to the right places to help educate them? An active listening system, right connected to your data platform, and this new generation of B2B sales and marketing will rely more on these behavioral signals, both explicit and implicit, to drive pipeline.

00:05:45:21 - 00:06:18:00
不明
Even take the customary ideal customer profile, right? ICP, a core part of most go to market strategies. It comes from photographic data, maybe post-purchase information in your CRM, but it still feels a lot like guessing you don't know when companies that fit your ICP are actually in-market. So we need an evolved customer profile, one with active listening. Or better yet, an agent to flag and interpret behavior as a way to do account planning and one that is dynamic, right?

00:06:18:00 - 00:06:54:05
不明
An active customer profile list that is constantly kept up to date and thus has the potential to fix this classic process of handing off spreadsheets of leads and support tickets between organizations. Instead, a unified customer profile gives you a marketing, sales, and customer success teams, a common understanding of accounts and the behavior it should measure and optimize exactly which parts the customer or prospect should take, and recognize the account opportunities based on both online and offline interest.

00:06:54:08 - 00:07:20:12
不明
It should support a shared AI framework for orchestrating leads and buying groups in real time. And active listening requires a wide range of first, second, and third party data to be effective in both planning, personalization as well as in decision making. The next best action for an account a way to directly use insights across the entire customer lifecycle.

00:07:20:14 - 00:07:46:27
不明
It all adds up to calculated prioritization for the front office, and drastically less frustration for the customer because their experiences are relevant, timely, and personalized. So with the right data foundation in place, let's look at how to craft the right experience that fuels the personalization for each account and every individual in that buying group. We've all gotten better at finding information.

00:07:46:29 - 00:08:16:03
不明
It's more digitally available, and while search engines and websites are still very relevant, ChatGPT has made conversational research a lot more mainstream and will become the predominant way for your customers to find information. A new generation of customers won't be on your website, downloading whitepapers and giving your email. Instead, they'll ask a conversational agent, ideally one that is managed by you for a summary of all the available information.

00:08:16:05 - 00:08:44:19
不明
With the top three key takeaways in this new world, we'll have to reimagine what content production looks like. Designing assets specifically for these scenarios, you may have to break assets into modular fragments so that the end customers I can talk to your agent to assemble research in real time. Now, we may not be an agent to agent interactions at scale today, but you have to start preparing for it now.

00:08:44:22 - 00:09:21:07
不明
The other factor, when you think about the sheer scale of personalization across all of these various dimensions required for by research is that content needs have increased exponentially. Today, it's a very manual process to create variance, maybe often just created for specific meetings of a specific personas. And the opportunity here now is for AI agents to use those core creative assets and the fragments that you have built to create variations with unique messaging and tone for the intimacy required for customer relationships.

00:09:21:10 - 00:09:49:03
不明
And to make it relevant, the agents need rich customer data and context to create just the right experience. So imagine an experienced creation agent as a member of your account team, pulling together just the relevant materials for a meeting on the fly, or making it available to customers just when they need it. And you might be able to make this work for some of your largest accounts, because you're willing to invest in a human intensive white glove approach to that process.

00:09:49:05 - 00:10:16:29
不明
But how do you do this? If you have to go from 30 to even 100 accounts without exponentially increasing your cost? This reimagination of B2B includes building relationships at scale, using digital customer experiences powered by a well-oiled content supply chain that can adapt and streamline content production. Specifically for this new layer of consumption. We need to be where the customer is going and where many already are.

00:10:17:01 - 00:10:40:02
不明
Experiences need to be educational, engaging. They need to be self-service and are ready. The question is how will you adapt your content strategy to fit in this new world? So no matter how large the customer base is in B2B, your relationship with them should always feel personal. It is all about relationships. Generic messaging or campaigns don't create value.

00:10:40:04 - 00:11:06:09
不明
And it's very hard today because building relationships at scale is challenging, because your large accounts may have a 50 to 100 different people engaging with you, researching for over a year across different channels. And even if you only have hundreds of these types of customers, the number of interactions you get are always in multiples. Larger. So creating these unique journeys requires an incredible amount of digital orchestration.

00:11:06:11 - 00:11:31:08
不明
You have to place relevant content and experiences in front of a number of different personas practitioners, decision makers. And you have to create step by step paths for each of them. The permutations can be endless. If you think of your mid-market and SMB segments, the issue might be about the coverage model. A single sales rep or a customer success manager might be responsible for 100 different accounts.

00:11:31:10 - 00:12:03:11
不明
And it becomes very hard for them to prioritize which ones to focus on. This is a perfect use case for agent orchestration in B2B three row. Feed the AI all that data, your library of experiences, the goals you're trying to accomplish, and should map the right journey for each persona. So when they come to your site on the engage with you marketing, sales, and customer success all wrapped into one digital concierge experience that can engage in a meaningful conversation with them.

00:12:03:14 - 00:12:29:13
不明
And then through that process, qualify each persona as part of a buying center. This type of agent journey for your buying groups is the magic of three B2B 3.0. It's personalized relationships at scale, and the AI will continue to learn from the interactions and optimize their models. And this will impact how marketing places experiences. Think of it as a high frequency experience trading across multiple channels.

00:12:29:15 - 00:12:51:09
不明
And this agent tech journey is like your organization's autonomous vehicle, right? That takes a customer on a cross-country road trip every time they want to take a detour. Your marketing system plots an updated course to keep them on track, and maybe even help them get there faster. So, like every industry, B2B is entering entering a new era of AI.

00:12:51:11 - 00:13:17:19
不明
It's rapidly redrawing the customer lifecycle. Adobe was built for this, right? With your partnership, we have led the transformation of customer experience throughout the internet, mobile and social eras. And now this era of AI across both B2C and B2B. Despite these revolutions, we find that content, data and journeys have remained the core pillars that need to get reimagined.

00:13:17:22 - 00:13:32:01
不明
And we've let the market many years ago by reimagining the lead lifecycle with Marketo, we built and have supported predictive AI capabilities with trust for more than 15 years.

00:13:32:03 - 00:14:03:08
不明
And we launched the first enterprise grade real time data platform with orchestration and decisioning more than five years ago. And you add to that 40 years of creativity and a digital heritage of helping transform the world's largest, largest known brands. And with your partnership together, we believe we are in a unique position to lead the charge with B2B Treat Auto B2B is going to help you drive more profitable growth focused on the full customer lifecycle, bringing revenue teams together.

00:14:03:10 - 00:14:32:20
不明
Whether you're focused on leads, accounts or buying groups. And we're doing that by taking technology from automation to orchestration, the infusing of agent AI and conversational experiences based on a unified view of the account buying group and leads. We also know how hard this is adopting AI engine AI while safeguarding privacy and your brand. Figuring out what this means for your teams and the processes that you've relied on for so many years.

00:14:32:22 - 00:14:54:18
不明
We're doing this ourselves, both on my team as well as throughout Adobe. We know a lot of you are going through this, trying to safely unlock AI potential and maximize your outcomes. And we know many of you are in different stages of this evolution, but Adobe is committed to helping meet you where you are and partnering with you on building this path to B2B trade.

00:14:54:19 - 00:15:28:00
不明
Auto. So with all of that said, what are your customers expect today? What does your marketing team look like to tackle these new challenges? And what is your customer success or sales teams look like in this new world of B2B point? Auto? To help answer some of these questions, I want to bring on an incredible Adobe partner and innovator and her team and her company at Nvidia are deeply thinking about AI adoption to drive more personalization for their customers and to give you a front row seat to how she's approaching this transformation.

00:15:28:03 - 00:15:46:17
不明
I am so excited to be welcoming Vice President President of Digital Marketing at Nvidia, Alessandra Abril.

00:15:46:19 - 00:16:11:19
不明
Good afternoon. Adobe Summit woo! I probably shouldn't admit this out loud, but I'm missing the Nvidia conference to be here today. But I'm really excited. I mean, marketers you all you know you guys are my people. And I'm excited to share with you Nvidia's go to market strategy with AI. You know, marketing as we know, is evolving at an unprecedented pace.

00:16:11:21 - 00:16:47:11
不明
Traditional approaches no longer suffice in a world where AI is reshaping how we connect, communicate, and engage with our customers. At Nvidia, we're leading this transformation, leveraging AI to modernize marketing, streamline operations, and deliver highly relevant, personalized experiences. So today I'll walk through how we're marketing modernization, how we're doing our marketing organization. What does that look like for us and how we're leveraging AI insights to engage buyers, and what the future of generative campaigns looks like for us.

00:16:47:14 - 00:17:12:08
不明
Now, for as long as I can remember, marketing's mantra has been delivering the right message to the right person at the right time. We all know this. This has been the same story our entire career. But marketing should be intelligent and dynamic as a technology that we build. Our goal is to align market marketing efforts seamlessly with our customers expectations and business needs.

00:17:12:10 - 00:17:31:13
不明
Now, I've been on this personalization career my entire career, like I said, and we all have, right? It's the whole it's the same story. In the early days, it was a one to all approach brands. Delivering generic messages to a broad audience is hoping to resonate with as many people as possible. Kind of like sticking spaghetti on a wall and hoping it sticks.

00:17:31:13 - 00:18:08:16
不明
Throwing spaghetti on the wall, hoping it sticks. Then came rules based marketing. Here marketers establish simple or in some cases, not so simple rules to guide campaigns targeting customers based on basic demographics like behaviors got really complex, really fast. But then our tools evolve. Companies like Adobe, we shifted to segment targeting. We began using data to classify our audiences into distinct segments, enabling us to deliver more personalized messaging with improvements in data processing and data modeling.

00:18:08:23 - 00:18:39:09
不明
We turned to our CDP and predictive analytics for even more precise targeting. In this era, I like to think of our style as the mixed Netflix model of content delivery, focusing on a one to few persona based strategy. Now we stand at the forefront of hyper personalization, where every interaction can be uniquely crafted for individual users. This is made possible with an AI agent.

00:18:39:12 - 00:19:13:17
不明
Jensen Huang, our CEO, shared a bold vision. I'm hoping that Nvidia will be a 50,000 employee company with 100 million AI assistants in every single group. Think about that 100 million AI assistants working alongside us, transforming marketing and customer engagement. This isn't just a vision. It's already happening. AI agents are reshaping content creation, campaign management, and lead generation.

00:19:13:19 - 00:19:46:04
不明
They can analyze massive data sets, optimize marketing spend, and even generate personalized outreach all in real time. And to quote Jensen once more, AI isn't going to come take your job, but someone using AI, they may come take your job. With that in mind, we all need to learn to use AI so we can augment our productivity. Again, the concept of personalization is not a novel idea.

00:19:46:07 - 00:20:21:08
不明
It's been the focal point for quite some time at Nvidia. Our aim is to deliver relevant experiences tailored to diverse audiences. We have a pretty complex challenge. We're simultaneously marketing to 20,000 AI researchers and 1 billion gamers. And our job is to ensure that they can find the right message that resonates with their unique interests and needs. While we've made some strides in creating micro segments and mastering the delivery of the next best asset, there remains a tendency to generalize.

00:20:21:11 - 00:20:50:08
不明
This is where the opportunity for deeper personalization lies. Imagine if we can not only determine the next best asset to present, but also generate it in real time for each individual. This approach transforms our interactions into personalized conversations with every single customer. We would be able to provide them with content that speaks directly to their unique interests and requirements, delivering precisely what they want to know.

00:20:50:11 - 00:21:17:12
不明
This shift from generalized marketing to individualized messaging will not only enhance user engagement, it would foster a stronger connection and address the specific needs of each person. We can create a more meaningful and impactful experience. Well, I don't know about you, but I'm not letting I take my job. And I'm taking Jensen's advice, and we're using it to improve how we go to market.

00:21:17:15 - 00:21:44:16
不明
Meet Mia, our marketing intelligence assistant, currently a work in progress. Mia has some amazing tools that let her analyze our data and understand our users better. She figures out what's most important to them and comes up with creative strategies. Then she creates personalized content based on that data and different user profiles. Mia can also optimize the customer journey in real time.

00:21:44:18 - 00:22:15:20
不明
Right now we do some of this work manually and some through automation. But think about the possibilities. If an agent can handle all of these functions simultaneously. I don't know about you, but I was pretty excited about Adobe's exciting announcements because they fit into our next phase of modernization perfectly. Mia, our marketing assistant, will leverage agents from the Adobe ecosystem like the audience agent, the journey agent, the experience agent alongside other internal agents.

00:22:15:20 - 00:22:51:17
不明
We may build. And this combination will turn Mia into a comprehensive marketing powerhouse, uniquely guiding each customer journey. Now, don't get your hopes up. Mia is not a product we're selling, but rather something we're actively building. Nvidia leveraging Nvidia AI and solutions like Adobe. We can augment our team and automate personalization like never before. I really like Sunil's example with the maps to illustrate how technology has evolved our experience.

00:22:51:20 - 00:23:01:01
不明
As we think about this from a marketing campaign perspective, I'd like to share how we transformed our newsletter process.

00:23:01:04 - 00:23:27:11
不明
He talked about 1.0 and then 2.0. So initially we had 19 different newsletters tailored to specific topics. While this allowed us to target opted in segments, it also led to some inefficiencies. Many subscribers opted in to multiple newsletters, resulting in duplicate content and a fragmented experience. This is kind of like our window experience. It lacked personalization that our audiences expect.

00:23:27:13 - 00:23:58:11
不明
Recognizing this challenge, we evolved to a single newsletter format by leveraging our CDP and data modeling. We were able to personalize each section of the newsletter based on various attributes such as industry, job role, job title and account. This shift not only streamlined our communication, but enhanced relevance for our subscribers. Each recipient now receives content tailored to their specific interests, creating a more engaging experience.

00:23:58:14 - 00:24:27:05
不明
I was watching Hillary Cook, presentation earlier today. I don't know if you guys caught that, but one of the things she also mentioned was less is more. This is what we went through. Less is more. It was going to less people by not having the 19 newsletters, but we had more impact and more engagement. Because now they're receiving personalized content, but now they're receiving it in pre-written fragments that are mix and match to meet each person's interests.

00:24:27:08 - 00:24:48:28
不明
Looking ahead, I envision a future powered by generative AI, where the entirety of the newsletter is uniquely created and written for each user. Every customer interaction would be dynamic and continuously adapt. Meeting a user where they are. Like I said, like having a conversation with your customers.

00:24:49:00 - 00:25:10:09
不明
Now, Jensen has declared that this is the year of the agents. Everybody's talking about it. And as I mentioned, Mia, our marketing intelligence assistant, is going to be powered by various agents. And today our focus is on how we can train and enable these agents so that our assistants can reason across them for added benefit. So combining them and getting them to work together, that's the next phase.

00:25:10:09 - 00:25:25:28
不明
That'll be kind of like the 3.0 for us. Our campaigns will turn into guided tours evolving in real time. That's the power of AI driven marketing. Orchestration.

00:25:26:00 - 00:25:49:20
不明
Now, to wrap things up, I'd like to share some final thoughts on the key attributes to our success. Firstly, having Jensen as our executive sponsors knows secret a tremendous advantage and it certainly helps get all our employees on board for this transition. But we still face some resistance. It's still scary. It's still new. It's still a whole new area to learn.

00:25:49:22 - 00:26:14:18
不明
And so this is where, you know, pilot and scale. Pilot and scale start small. We started with tools like, I know takers, you know, adding, no takers to the meetings were in generative AI content generators and and slowly showing people how it can increase their productivity and show it, showing them how to evolve their workflows. And then there was an emphasis on training.

00:26:14:20 - 00:26:36:27
不明
We schedule things like AI day partnered with Adobe for Adobe Day, and we bring hands on training and mentorship, how to build the agents, how to use the agents, how to how to change your workflows. Now, I simplified it a bit, but these are the key successes. You know, in a nutshell, these are the three buckets of how we lead transformation.

00:26:36:29 - 00:26:50:08
不明
The potential for innovation is vast, and I'm excited to see how you all also integrate these amazing agents into your processes. Thank you for your attention.

00:26:50:10 - 00:26:57:23
不明
Thank you so much.

00:26:57:26 - 00:27:15:04
不明
So thank you for that lesson. And first of all, I want to thank you for spending the time with us here today. I know it was an incredibly busy week for your GTC this week, so appreciate you spending time here. So let's talk about you know, you mentioned your own evolution from, you know, what was 19 newsletters to an audience centric approach.

00:27:15:04 - 00:27:37:16
不明
And now personalization. Can you walk us through that evolution and what that means in terms of change management for your teams? Oh, lots of change management. I mean, every group had their own newsletter, right, that they owned and managed and controlled 100%. What went in it, what order it went in all of that. And from a customer experience.

00:27:37:16 - 00:27:59:29
不明
So they were they were signing up for more than one to get the content that they wanted. And there was some duplicate content across these newsletters because there are some messages that go across all of the verticals and then some that was specific. Letting go of that control was not easy for folks. And then they wanted to know, like who it was going to and how many people was going to.

00:27:59:29 - 00:28:18:18
不明
And, you know, it was sometimes going to a smaller audience. And they had to realize, though, that while it was going to a smaller audience, it was having a bigger impact. The words we choose, I think, are important. It's a pilot. It's a proof of concept. Let's start small. We can always go back. Right? Let's just see what happens.

00:28:18:19 - 00:28:42:03
不明
And that helps relieve their anxiety a lot. And then we we prove it out. And then once we have the results, that kind of speaks for itself. Fantastic. So you also talk about how you're leveraging AI and all throughout this process, right. Maybe talk a little bit about how you see AI augmenting sort of what your teams are doing across the entire process, right from audience building to journey design to, you know, content production and so on.

00:28:42:05 - 00:29:06:03
不明
I mean, we're really thinking about it very similarly to how Adobe's doing it, thinking about it. You know, you have if you have like an audience agent being able to dynamically create those audiences in real time, meaning that, you know, as the audience is, is shifting through the journey. It's changing what that segment looks like. And then the content creation, you know, we are using it, generative AI to create content.

00:29:06:05 - 00:29:28:05
不明
Probably about 20% of our, marketing team is using it actively. And that's great. And and it is kind of like a, cowritten experience today. You know, it's it's with them. But I see eventually there's these agents being able to lead that and connect the dots and do that automatically. And then I love the experimentation agent.

00:29:28:05 - 00:29:49:16
不明
Right. So I mean, that's customer. Target, Adobe target today. Right? And so we're, constantly running pilots to see what works and experiments. And so being able to automate that is fantastic. So I mean, we talk a lot about how we use generative AI within our own sort of teams. Certainly there's lots of concern about, you know, governance and, you know, putting guardrails in place.

00:29:49:16 - 00:30:09:16
不明
Right. Can you talk about, you know, how you're thinking about that? Yes. I mean, we have a whole team just kind of focusing on policy. And we do business in China so it doesn't get more regulated than that. But, so it's just something we, we, we're, we're constantly keeping an eye on. What are the regulations that we need to abide on by, abide by.

00:30:09:18 - 00:30:28:24
不明
But we're also very, cautious of how we deal with the data. And so we, you know, we don't want any PII currently in our chat box. And so that's something we're sort of avoiding right now. If that evolves, I'm not sure. I mean, I think there's some added benefit to that. Can you know, the personalization can go to the next level of course.

00:30:28:24 - 00:30:47:20
不明
But there needs to be some kind of opt in experience. So we haven't touched that just yet. But that is something that I think, again, we'll we'll start small and figure out where it fits. We have a, chat bot that we created for our conference that does, provide some recommended sessions. And it's looking at the audience is a more of a, segment view.

00:30:47:20 - 00:31:04:21
不明
So it's not personal. But there may be a, I think, a great experience to get to that personal level that people might be willing to do. I'm going to shamelessly plug the summit concierge for this audience. Yeah. So, and you also talk about, as we think about sort of, you know, the teams adopting AI now, right?

00:31:04:23 - 00:31:23:11
不明
What does that look like in terms of how you think about maybe hiring for your team or the org design, right, that you set up, you know, in the sort of new world? Yeah. So we've definitely thought about, that and how we organize our team. And it's made it's made some changes and shifts and how we, how we how we organize team.

00:31:23:13 - 00:31:46:14
不明
And so from the technical side, there's so much to learn. We organize them into what we call AI verticals, and we, you know, for example, it could be 11 frameworks. There's about seven different verticals, I think, that we've identified. And within each vertical, we have a set amount of team members from the technical teams that are working on this area.

00:31:46:14 - 00:32:09:14
不明
And they can become a specialist expert in these areas. And eventually I see them cross training. But this allowed us to have some experts on the team in a shorter amount of time, some focus for them, which I think they really appreciated. And it allowed us to accelerate our whole learning. So we've done that and then we've also, from a business side, kind of organized an AI programs group there.

00:32:09:16 - 00:32:35:29
不明
I will it will and is happening everywhere. So it's not like you can centralize it per se. But we have an AI programs group that's thinking about, how these agents will communicate together. And then that's all within one team. Now. Fantastic. So how do you sort of then onboard and operationalize the adoption of AI? Because that's the other thing that we hear quite often is, yes, you know, scaling is one part of it, but what's the what's the onboarding process look like.

00:32:35:29 - 00:32:59:05
不明
What's the operational sort of part look like. Yeah. So I'll use our content generation tools an example. So at first people were really excited. Oh yeah. You know using general AI to create content and, you know, plug it in. And it was they appreciated it but then wouldn't come back to use it. Or there was also some cases where they used it and they were like, oh, I can't use this.

00:32:59:05 - 00:33:21:27
不明
It's not the right tone of voice. It's it just sounds weird. It just wasn't feeding the Nvidia brand. And so there was a little bit of trial and error. We had to work on the training, the model to fit our needs. And working with the campaign managers and the and the content team in that process so that they felt ownership and they saw the improvements.

00:33:21:29 - 00:33:42:07
不明
That was part of it. And then the second part is integrating it into tools are already using. So we integrated it with APIs into things like, Google Docs and Google Sheets. And so they can leverage those tools within their workflows. And now we have a lot of training. Again, we hold we hold, lunch and learn workshops.

00:33:42:07 - 00:33:58:16
不明
And we, we go to two different teams meetings and we, really kind of help handhold them a bit in the beginning. But we're now at, I would say 20% of our marketing team is actively using it. More than that have access and are using it occasionally. But these are active users. So that's fantastic. We're we're happy with that.

00:33:58:18 - 00:34:16:10
不明
Yeah. I also like what you do with Innovation Days and how sort of, you know, you bring everybody along. So as we get ready to wrap up here, any sort of final sort of writing advice for all the marketing leaders in this room here. I mean, this is this is an exciting time. And for everybody, it's a level playing field.

00:34:16:12 - 00:34:34:13
不明
We're all learning this at the same time. So people who are trying to get a leg up in their careers, I mean, this is it. We're all learning this. It's all about jumping in and figuring out how it can make an impact on your businesses. And so I think that's exciting. I'm all in. And my team has been, really on board with my journey with us.

00:34:34:13 - 00:34:50:01
不明
And we're we're doing some pretty amazing things. And it's, it's getting it's getting some visibility for my CEO, which is awesome. So yeah, it's it's go out there and do it and let's share. So we're here for two. I'd love to hear what some people are doing. Fantastic. Thank you again for the partnership for the time you spent here.

00:34:50:04 - 00:35:00:08
不明
Appreciate everything that you do. Thank you. Thank you.

00:35:00:10 - 00:35:22:28
不明
Once again, thank you. Alessandra. I'm ready to see some product in action. Ready to see some demos. Yeah. So let's do that. So here to help me with that, I want to welcome on stage senior director of Product management for the B2B customer journeys portfolio, Raj Patel. Come on on. Come to school.

00:35:23:00 - 00:35:45:12
不明
How's this feel? Different. All right. Thank you. Sydney. Alessandra, great conversation, especially about AI in your workplace. As I look around the audience, I recognize a lot of familiar faces and people I know. Our product teams have built deep relationships, friendships, and more importantly, we really appreciate all the great feedback you've given us to improve the Adobe Experience platform.

00:35:45:14 - 00:36:07:08
不明
Recently, I had a really, really good conversation with a longtime customer of ours at our Adobe Cab. She was mentioned me about some of the challenges she's having her business. She's like, Raj, you wouldn't believe it. Every single marketing campaign we launch, we use ten different systems. It's a complete mess. Next, every conference I go to, there's something new about AI.

00:36:07:08 - 00:36:31:02
不明
It's like exploding in every different direction. I see the value. But how do I actually practically adopt it in my workplace? Then she got super fired up. She's in the last four months she's been in her CMO office every day. They've had intense conversations around growth, tech consolidation, seeing the full account lifecycle. Why don't we have systems to actually enable us in the future?

00:36:31:05 - 00:36:51:05
不明
Does this sound familiar? I think it may. I talked to many of you guys in the audience today around that. And what's been really awesome. And you guys just saw a really great day. Two keynote. We had B2B, go to market orchestration with Naomi. We are launching something brand new to the market. We are launching B2B go to market orchestration.

00:36:51:05 - 00:37:20:08
不明
It's a unified solution to power entire customer lifecycle. So think about acquisition, upsell, cross-sell, and retention. Under the hood, it's a tightly integrated suite of products that will help your teams really think about streamlining your marketing operations and deliver world class experiences really through the help of agents. What I really love about our go to market platform, it includes our market leading products.

00:37:20:11 - 00:37:43:24
不明
This includes Marketo, engage, Adobe Experience Manager, Commerce. Shout out to all the experience makers out there. You guys have done a great job to really improve our experiences. We also have some fast rising products. Adobe Journey Optimizer for B2B, our newly introduced customer journey analytics for B2B as well. We're bringing significant innovation across the entire board for B2B.

00:37:43:29 - 00:38:04:04
不明
What I really love about 3.0 is everybody in the audience today, I think you probably use our products. You guys are daily users, so you guys are really shaping our 3.0 vision practice owners, marketers, partners IT analysts. And if you've if you ever ran a campaign or launched a campaign, it can be very tedious. You have a lack of it.

00:38:04:11 - 00:38:23:17
不明
Unified account profile. Predefined journeys often get stuck. It can get really challenging. And the 3.0 world that Sunil talked about, we're really transforming the way your teams work. So think about it this way. Next time you plan on launch a campaign, you're more in a proactive position. You're actually listening to account signals. Then you take those account signals.

00:38:23:22 - 00:38:43:22
不明
You can create and engage with audiences specifically to the buying groups, so you know exactly who you're marketing to. Then you pass that on over to sales. Sales always like are these leads good? Are they not? They are. These are real insights that they can actually take real impact and really collaborate with. And lastly, you can measure those impact.

00:38:43:25 - 00:39:07:22
不明
At the heart of your marketing stack is your data buying groups. I think you guys have all heard about it. A lot of buzz, a lot of stir, especially from of the customer is here. Let me tell you this, the hype is real. We're seeing true customer value, especially with some of our early customers. Last summer we launched agile B2B account orchestration and buying groups, and we've had tremendous momentum and early success.

00:39:07:22 - 00:39:27:18
不明
Actually, Adobe, our marketing team, uses it to orchestrate their journeys. And why are buying groups so important? I often hear that from many of our customers. B2B as you guys know, it's a team selling sport. You need to know who's it. The account, who they are, their preferences, their intent. But more importantly, do they love your brand or the event?

00:39:27:20 - 00:39:46:15
不明
They're a bit of a detractor because that can really hold up the sales cycle. And as we think about buying groups, it's kind of like a physical, real world bingo card. You got to fill out every single square. You need to have a personalized message for each one of them. So B2B marketing buying groups is the new frontier.

00:39:46:15 - 00:40:08:01
不明
You got to get on it. It's a new data model. It's actually something physical. Your teams can hold on to. It's something that you can create personalized experiences for. So one thing we're excited about with the audience agent is buying group discovery. What we're doing here is we're intelligently predicting who should be in the buying group. We're crunching millions and millions of data points through generative AI.

00:40:08:08 - 00:40:24:26
不明
We're looking at your CRM data. We're looking all the way down to those opportunities. You won, you lost. We're looking at your first party intent here. We're looking at your third party intent data to give you this skeleton. Who should be in your buying group. What are their roles? What are their titles? What you need to do to start and launch a campaign with.

00:40:24:28 - 00:40:42:08
不明
So I want to show you guys this in action, and I want to introduce our product marketing extraordinaire, Karishma, to give you guys a brief demo. Thanks so much, Raj. First, I'd like to thank ServiceNow for letting us use their brand for this vision demo and to let you know that the data that you'll see is fictitious. So I'm planning and you go to market.

00:40:42:08 - 00:41:10:00
不明
And my biggest challenge is identifying the right accounts to target. I want across all my HR service delivery into my existing IT service management customer base. Well, I have this new buying group dashboard inside Adobe Journey Optimizer B2B edition. This provides me a single command center to help with this. I can use my Account Explorer to see accounts that are showing a high level of engagement, and this one looks great and I can even click for more details to further refine my planning.

00:41:10:02 - 00:41:30:06
不明
I'll also be able to see account highlights, those accounts that are surging interest in the last 30 days, and those are at risk, that need a little bit more engagement. I'll also be able to see a snapshot of my buying groups, buying groups that are highly engaged, those that are high velocity and those that are more stagnant and need more engagement.

00:41:30:08 - 00:41:49:24
不明
And lastly, this contact coverage map makes it super easy to see my contact coverage across all of my products and my solutions. Now these insights are great, but I want to turn this into action and I know exactly how to do this. I can use my audience agent either through these out of the box shortcuts or through custom prompts.

00:41:49:27 - 00:42:12:20
不明
I'll ask, can you recommend accounts to cross-sell HR service delivery? And let's fire this off. And in seconds. And not only recommends the accounts that I should focus on, but also identifies key personas I should include in my buying group and even when I should engage with them in my journey. Now, this is a type of insights to action I need.

00:42:12:23 - 00:42:39:24
不明
Let's add these buying groups. What used to take me hours now happens in seconds with our audience agent. It uses first party serum data, intent data, and inferred personas to instantly build and refine my buying groups and provides me with this wonderful overview page to see if they're ready to be added to my journey. Let's dive in. The completeness score looks good and overall contact coverage across these three recommend recommended roles.

00:42:39:24 - 00:43:00:08
不明
Looks solid. And what's great it's also recommending journeys for me. This first one matches my cross-sell motion perfectly. So let's go with that. As Raj mentioned, B2B selling is truly a team sport, so we have the right insights on our accounts and I recommended the right roles and buying groups. So I think this will help me with my account progression.

00:43:00:10 - 00:43:18:08
不明
So before we dive into this journey, I want to pass it back to Raj to walk you through our upcoming journey innovations. That's awesome Christmas. It's been really cool to actually watch this come from customer feedback. Going to prototype now we're actually launching it live from any of our customers or tribe. All right. So now we have the right buying group to market to sell to.

00:43:18:13 - 00:43:37:25
不明
Now we need the right journey and the content. This is the fun part, but arguably the hardest part in the marketing process. You have so many different ways you can think about your content and journeys, but how do we really bring it all together? Personalization at scale for B2B means having a pre an intelligent journey for every member of that buying group.

00:43:37:28 - 00:44:02:07
不明
So we're really excited to announce Journey Agents. Journey agents will allow you to design and optimize your workflows for these key buying group members, whether a lead based workflow. Marketo. Shout out to all our Marketo customers there or an account based workflow. In agile B2B, our agents can help you create your next email campaign webinar. Our multi-channel journey all within one canvas.

00:44:02:11 - 00:44:18:25
不明
Lean on our agents to be more predictive and be more smarter. When you create your campaigns. All right, Christian, let's give him a look. Let's do it. So let's dive into this journey that we just added our accounts and buying groups to. As a marketer, it's so powerful for me to see these buying groups in a single flow.

00:44:18:28 - 00:44:41:23
不明
In this journey, our HR decision makers view a social ad. They browse the ServiceNow website and they book a meeting with Adobe Brand Concierge B2B edition. Let's preview that experience. This is our brand new conversational platform that lets marketers engage with each member of the buying group, delivering personalized content and tailored conversations all in the right tone. And what's great?

00:44:41:24 - 00:45:04:01
不明
We can even listen to that engagement to progress our journeys. Our IT influencers receive an email to download. Download a white paper, but as recommended by our agent, we should also target our practitioners in this journey. So let's add a path for them. This is easier than ever with our journey agent all us. Can you add all practitioners to a person journey inside Marketo?

00:45:04:01 - 00:45:31:18
不明
Engage and target them with the webinar campaign. And let's fire it off! Wow. It recommends the rest of my account journey right here. Previewing this. This looks perfect. I'm going to go ahead and apply it to my canvas. So I'll head over into Marketo Engage where I can create my journeys and the content for this campaign. Wow guys, this is great!

00:45:31:19 - 00:45:54:21
不明
Marketo engage got a brand new visual canvas and I even have an AI assistant over here that I can help generate my content. I'll ask, can you help generate emails for this journey? Raj, what do you think of this? For that? This is huge. Marketo engage gets a new canvas. But I think the bigger point here, Karishma is journey creation can take a lot of time.

00:45:54:21 - 00:46:15:14
不明
Agents can really help short circuit that and be more productive I assume right? Totally. Although it takes me a lot of time, I can also make this make sure this content is on brand and tailored for HR, service and practitioners. I can select my reference assets right here, so it's all tailored and ready to go, and all my content is right here for me.

00:46:15:16 - 00:46:43:28
不明
Let's preview that webinar invite. Overall, the copy looks good, but I want to make a few tweaks, maybe change out the tone and this image. Well, I can easily do this with our email editor using drag and drop components, templates, and custom HTML. I can generate new messaging and with AI assistant for content generation, I can generate new messaging based on the buying group role, the journey stage and tone to make it even more relevant and engaging for our customers.

00:46:44:00 - 00:47:02:18
不明
Now this is a hyper personalization that you were talking about. This is actually what exactly Lisandro was talking about 1 to 1 for the buying group. Exactly. So I wanted to change out that image. Right. So I can easily do this with Adobe Firefly. It generates new variations for me and I can choose from those right here. You know what?

00:47:02:18 - 00:47:27:16
不明
I want to go with this first one. Or I can even edit existing images with Adobe Express. This looks perfect. I'm ready to go ahead and save out this email. All right. Christmas. So you sent this email. But what is the personalization experience for our customers. What do they actually see here. Let me show you Raj our HR decision makers interacted with Brand Concierge in a personalized conversation.

00:47:27:18 - 00:47:49:23
不明
And it looks like Rachel here is already set for 2 p.m. on Thursday. Our IT influencers received an email that was completely tailored to their industry, their account, and their role, and they even had an opportunity to download that whitepaper on tips and tricks. Same goes for our practitioners. They received a tailored invite from that webinar campaign that we set up in Marketo engaged.

00:47:49:26 - 00:48:12:10
不明
And clicking in they see the on demand summary by interactive webinars with AI generated chapter ization. Now, Raj, I think this is a true power of Adobe Journey orchestration. Marketers can engage across inbound and outbound channels in a single flow. That's awesome. Okay, so let's quickly rewind. We saw agents can create the buying group in journeys. But how do we have sales?

00:48:12:10 - 00:48:28:24
不明
Take advantage. Krishna, you're in the field all the time. How do we help salespeople close deals? What's the secret sauce here? Well, Raj, I think it's all about timing the right place at the right time. As buying group members are engaging, we need to pass these leads over to sales. Did you know I started my career in sales?

00:48:28:24 - 00:48:46:18
不明
By the way, I did know that, Raj, but I don't think you were a closer back then, were you? I'm glad we have you on the product team. I'm actually glad I'm on the product team. I think my manager somewhere out here. Thank you for not transfer me to sales. That would have been all that. But anyways, when I was in sales, I think one of the key challenges I had was not having the right insights.

00:48:46:21 - 00:49:09:11
不明
So I was unable to really prepare for customer meetings or phone calls. That's that's what all this is about, right? It's more than just a insights product. We also need to send personalized content to our sales reps. Yeah, absolutely. So that's why we're excited to announce a whole new set of capabilities for sales teams, stars, builders eight years everybody that your marketing teams collaborate with.

00:49:09:16 - 00:49:26:08
不明
On the content side, we are introducing experienced generation for Adobe Experience Manager. Quickly be able to create content through generative AI for that buying group for that account. Another key feature that we are announcing.

00:49:26:11 - 00:49:46:27
不明
There you go. There's a slide. Yeah. Another key feature announcing is the account qualification agent. And what I really like about this one, it actually helps sales and marketing teams create content like emails. When I was in sales, when I was late stage in opportunity needed high stakes, I would get writer's block. I wouldn't even know what to write to the customer.

00:49:46:27 - 00:50:03:08
不明
I didn't want to sound boring or vanilla. I need an assistant. I need an agent to really help create that content. What we're doing here is we're actually looking at the buying group journey, the context, and actually recommending text and imagery of what you should actually write in those emails. Christian, I think we should give em a quick look.

00:50:03:08 - 00:50:26:06
不明
Let's do it. As different buying group members are engaging based on activities like downloading a white paper or event attendance and buying group engagement, membership and scores increase. Once we reach that desired threshold, we can flag this as an interesting moment and hand these over to sales, creating a seamless handoff of our marketing. Qualified buying groups to our sales teams.

00:50:26:08 - 00:50:48:27
不明
And it's all interconnected as a service. Now sales rep I receive this email highlighting buying group activity, clicking in it looks like our account qualification agent is flagging that there's a missing buying group member. Now, the true power here is that it looks like it's recommending John as my missing buying group member, and I just met with John earlier this week.

00:50:49:00 - 00:51:11:22
不明
That's huge, Chris, but I think our friends in the field are like, actually, I would have been a rock star salesperson if I had something like this. By the way, I think you may have been a closer edge. We'll see about that. So as account qualification as agent is adding John, it even analyzes past content engagement history and recommends follow up emails and landing pages to send to these buying group members.

00:51:11:25 - 00:51:37:16
不明
And what's great is, as a sales rep, I can easily make changes. Teams can use Adobe Experience Manager sites to create a collection of content that's curated for each buying group member, and it's all in context and easily updated with fresh content on videos, whitepapers, blogs, and more. But since I learned from my sales meeting that these decision makers respond best to clear data and proof points, I'll add that type of content right here.

00:51:37:19 - 00:52:01:05
不明
All I can you add a section with data below the Hero Band banner and let's fire that off. And while my content advisor is working in the background and searches the entire repository for approved content to apply to this flow, this for this middle one looks good. So I'm going to go ahead and apply it. This landing page looks perfect.

00:52:01:05 - 00:52:23:17
不明
Let's publish this and fire this off to our buying group members. Back over to you. That's awesome. So you see now our service now could use AI and harness AI to build the right buying group and create a powerful multi-channel journey. But the next question is, is how do you optimize? How do you measure? How do you go back in that CMO office and have a really, really productive discussion?

00:52:23:23 - 00:52:46:29
不明
So I used, as you saw in Main Stage today, we have launched Customer Journey Analytics for B2B. This has been built from the ground up. It's a full account centric analytics platform. You can view the entire the entire account lifecycle, the buying groups, the engagement points and all the different content that customers are engaging with. So next time you walk into your CMO s office, feel, prepare, feel armed.

00:52:47:04 - 00:53:11:16
不明
Really help drive decisions with your team. All right, Christian, let's give them a quick look. Let's bring this all together. So ServiceNow teams can use customer journey analytics B2B edition to bring together real time KPIs to see how opportunities, pipeline, and average deal sizes are progressing. But that's not all. I can also use my cross-channel engagement panel to see buying group engagement across all my buying group stages.

Now this is really unique. I can even check in on those AI generated buying groups that we created earlier to see how they're responding. But I also want to measure my channels impact. I can see the impact across my buying group channels for email and webinar. And I can even create a filter touchpoint from there. But what I love the most about this is I have all these insights in a single view.

This really makes it so much easier to plan, create, engage, and measure and totally transforms how ServiceNow can go to market. Absolutely. Thank you. Krishna, let's give her a hand. Awesome demo here.

So as you guys can see, me and Karishma and our teams are super passionate about B2B and solving B2B marketers needs so much so we are wearing it everywhere we go. If you want a t shirt, I may have some more. So just a heads up. But B2B is such a key investment for Adobe. Adobe is the only software company in the world with a full end to end B2B platform, really servicing the needs of B2B marketers.

And as a product team, we are really interested in hearing your feedback, how it is actually moving the needle within your business.

Once again thanks, Raj. And what a fantastic job. It makes my job easier when talking about so much great innovation. Well, as we start to think about the future of B2B 3.0, but what it takes to augment human relationships with digital experiences. And I am going to go back to the analogy of the self-driving car. That evolution is about transforming a platform, right?

As a car owner, you can't just buy a bunch of cameras, drop them onto your car, then connect it to your phone. And like magic, you have an autonomous vehicle instead. It's a platform fully integrated, designed and wired, and trained for autonomous driving. The cameras, the sensors, the screens all wired into the steering and the pedals and mapped to intelligent software.

00:55:47:02 - 00:56:11:00
不明
So when we think about instrumenting a system for your go to market, the data, the content and the journeys are like those sensors, the screens and the steering for your B2B, for customer data, we need to replace today's manual process of handing off leads and tickets with a unified account profile and an active listening system that are like the sensors for specific demand, or for diagnosing the health of your account.

00:56:11:02 - 00:56:35:09
不明
B2B content is both educational and exciting, but the scale required to deliver is growing at an exponential rate. Your buyers are spending more time on screens, and so we need to intelligently assemble the right documents and the media. Just like an account team would pull together materials before a meeting. And you need the right experience with the right context based on what the customer has already heard or the products are showing interest in.

00:56:35:11 - 00:57:03:23
不明
And these journeys are about relationships at scale. And over the course of many years, this journey starts with a single prospect, then goes into a buying team and then ultimately multiple teams within an account. It expands to more products, renewals of contracts and events, and partnerships. As this relationship gets deeper, the expectation that you know your customer only gets greater in and out of journeys that are being orchestrated by an integrated system of data and content.

00:57:03:25 - 00:57:30:03
不明
The Adobe platform, as Raj in XML, showed you it was built to deliver a lot to market orchestration as this integrated system to become the self driving experience that takes your customers on a lifelong journey and aligns your people, process and technology so you can maximize every customer relationship. And we want to be partners in this reimagination. Help prepare your business for this new generation of B2B.
