Successful marketing leaders are using AI to transform how they build, manage and optimize websites, making them more dynamic, more personalized, and more engaging than ever before. In this session, we'll speak with marketing, design, and product leaders who will share real world examples, expert insight, and actionable strategies. Recently, website published our second annual state of the website report. It breaks down the current state of the website as well as marketing leaders priorities heading into 2025.

00:00:29:30 - 00:00:58:42
不明
We spoke with 500 marketing leaders about their websites and here's what they told us. Tech stacks continue to grow as marketing leaders build more capabilities to personalize their websites. The website really matters. In fact, 91% said it drives more revenue than any other channel and almost 70% plan to increase or maintain investments in AI tools. With generative AI, marketing, teams can create and refine on brand and highly personalized content, quickly cutting down on the time, complexity and effort involved.

00:00:58:47 - 00:01:25:51
不明
Whether it's generating visuals, copy, or even interactive elements. AI is removing roadblocks and enabling creativity at every stage of the process. Let's take a closer look at how teams are leveraging AI. We'll start by exploring how IMC Bank, one of Australia's leading financial institutions, is using Adobe Express within Webflow to streamline the website content creation. We'll hear from BBDO to understand how creative and marketing leaders are creating rich and immersive website experiences that convert.

00:01:25:55 - 00:01:40:33
不明
Finally, we'll speak with Adobe on how AI is helping to democratize creative and developmental skills to enable website owners to scale their impact. Let's get started with Adam Ross from IAM b Bank.

00:01:40:38 - 00:02:03:18
不明
Since 1888, indie Bank has been supporting people and communities across Australia to achieve their financial goals. It offers a range of financial solutions from banking to home and personal loans, business services and more. The team uses Web flow to build, manage and optimize their websites, and they've been experimenting with artificial intelligence in applications, from information retrieval to insights to content creation.

00:02:03:23 - 00:02:21:45
不明
Recently, the team was updating their business banking web page, and they used Adobe Express for website to create on brand imagery to help communicate financial products. Things like accounts, payroll, loans and other business services. Let's speak to Adam, who's UX and UI designer at RMB Bank, to learn about how they used artificial intelligence in content creation for their website.

00:02:21:50 - 00:02:38:55
不明
Adam, it's great to meet you. Great. Jamie. Paul. So, Adam, I have big Bank recently relaunched its business banking pages. Can you tell me a bit about what your goals were for this relaunch? Yeah, the primary goal was to create a distinct esthetic for the business section. So we wanted something that stood out from the personal section of the website.

00:02:39:00 - 00:03:02:16
不明
We started off with some feedback from the business banking team that we wanted something more professional and modern that would match our user base and personas. So ultimately, we were aiming to increase engagement with the pages and encourage more users to reach out to us. And so I imagine you had like a different ICP for your business banking pages than you would for your consumer pages and different so brand guidelines and style approaches.

00:03:02:21 - 00:03:25:55
不明
Yeah. So we have we have a distinct, style guide for our business section versus the personal section, and that's driven by our personas and the user needs. And to make sure that that matches what they're looking for because they've got different needs and pain points compared to our personal banking users. You used Adobe Express for Web Flow to generate images for your business banking pages.

00:03:26:06 - 00:03:45:21
不明
Why did you choose to do that? We chose to use Adobe Express because our team is small and nimble, are always looking for ways to speed up design and development process. Adobe Express was perfect for generating images for a few reasons. Firstly, it allowed us to create unique, unique images instead of using common stock that other websites might also be using.

00:03:45:26 - 00:04:05:34
不明
Secondly, and ensure consistency by allowing us to hone in exactly what we wanted to achieve. And then lastly, it enabled us to work quickly and efficiently, which was crucial because we wanted to turn around the very in a very short amount of time. And as I understand it, you used reference images, style guide, brand guidelines, as the basis when you started, was that correct?

00:04:05:39 - 00:04:29:38
不明
Yeah. So we used reference images that we created in, in other software, and we used that to then briefing Adobe Express on what images we wanted to put out and spin off versions of that. We have a design system in place, so we want to make sure that everything we, we output is very consistent. And with the business banking section as well, it has a unique esthetic that we need to stay, very familiar with for the user.

00:04:29:43 - 00:04:48:04
不明
So in addition to generating images, did you do anything else with the app? Yeah. So we used it to remove background images, and export it directly into website, which that app. A lot of time we could also export it to our design system in Figma, where we could then turn it into loading animations that we could import into website.

00:04:48:08 - 00:05:16:40
不明
So we had a few different uses for our used it. So it really sounds like Adobe Express. Our website helped you get creative powers that might have typically relied on specialists with, you know, really extreme skills and, you know, advanced software to remove backgrounds. Like, that's a pretty complicated thing, to do generally, since like, it's a lot easier now think in that sense, like, how does this process compare to what you did in the past, maybe working with third parties or outside agencies or designers to help you do this?

00:05:16:40 - 00:05:48:46
不明
Like, how is Adobe Express changing your workflows in terms of speed and effort? Yeah, I think that's probably one of the biggest advantages to Adobe Express is that any user can really use it. You don't have to have, degree in graphic design or any, hands on experience in more complicated image processing. So that really helped us to generate the images, to modify the images by removing backgrounds and then import them directly into the website with really no technical expertise.

00:05:48:47 - 00:06:18:01
不明
So it's, less hands on, less people involved, but I think the end result was just as powerful. And that really sounds like what the potential of AI is. It's, giving people capabilities to do tasks that might have been challenging in the past. So if you can give a marketing team member the ability to do some of the basic design work themselves, that allows your design team to then focus on the much more strategic things like, you know, building out a brand entirely, or working on more larger projects.

00:06:18:05 - 00:06:38:07
不明
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I think that's that's probably the biggest advantage to it is, you can do more powerful things with, with less resources. What have been the results since launching this updated business banking page? Yeah, we've had very positive feedback from the business banking team, and we've seen our conversion rates and engagements with the business banking section.

00:06:38:12 - 00:07:03:07
不明
Increase significantly since we, implemented the changes. So overall, we've seen all of our metrics that we use to measure user experience have increased. Lastly, what are your plans for using AI to further optimize your website? You know, I think every second conversation we have at IMB is is it is bad AI. We're already using it in the banking industry across most of our touchpoints.

00:07:03:07 - 00:07:25:47
不明
So AI powered chat bots, with generating images with AI out a B testing and optimizing the website is using AI where it's involved in our ad creative and our copywriting. So I think, it's just going to be it's just going to get more involved and more incorporated into all of our different touchpoints across the website and digital experience.

00:07:25:52 - 00:07:32:21
不明
Adam, thanks very much. Thanks so much, Paul.

00:07:32:26 - 00:07:58:46
不明
Building creative marketing and sales solutions is critical for business, whether B2B or B2C. As customer behavior evolves, buying journeys change and AI introduces new ways of building, managing, and optimizing websites. It's more important than ever that marketing leaders take advantage of these new opportunities. James Young is EVP and Head of creative Innovation at Omnicom, a leading provider of data inspired creative marketing and sales solutions with group agencies like BBDO.

00:07:58:49 - 00:08:23:26
不明
They're committed to helping businesses and brands scale growth with creative experiences that keep buyers engaged and taking action. James, it's great to speak with you. I'd speak with you as well, Bob. Thanks for having me. So we're seeing so many new tools and technologies powered by AI around creativity and generating content. How should marketing leaders tackle learning about this and using these in their workflows?

00:08:23:31 - 00:08:41:11
不明
I mean, I think it's kind of what you just said it is using it like the reps put the reps and, explore the tools that are out there, understand the tools that are coming, understand where these tools are going. Sounded like your teams, which sort of challenged or in different ways to kind of try out these new technologies.

00:08:41:11 - 00:09:08:26
不明
What what did you find to be the most effective for that? You know, we're trying a lot of different approach like methods and approaches, getting people involved because different people learn and approach this stuff in different ways. And we want to try to come from as many angles as we can. We started I guess it's two and a half years ago at this point where we set up a stable diffusion server to give people access to image generation, which is where really people start to get particularly excited about this.

00:09:08:27 - 00:09:26:04
不明
Everyone was excited about Midjourney, but the model of that wasn't one in such that we could give access to, say like hundreds of people in an agency. So the stable diffusion server allowed us to give that access to everybody to play around. It's a little bit more complex. And so we put a lot of energy into education.

00:09:26:04 - 00:09:52:50
不明
We did presentations to the agency where we walk them through how to approach these tools. We got really focused on, prompt writing. And then, you know, we expand from there. That small little focused workshops. We've had larger agency kind of wide workshops. We've had partners come in to present. We've had partners work with us to just set up kind of pilot programs or beta programs to give everybody access to some of the tools are developing.

00:09:52:55 - 00:10:26:07
不明
And then we've done like, you know, little fun stuff in contests internally, to get people an opportunity to explore this stuff, totally agnostic, of any clients so that it kind of takes some of that, that stress and expectation off of it. But we're still learning. We're still trying things. You know, we've got, a partner coming in in a few weeks, for example, where we're going to do like a film festival type of experience, where we group people together and give them a prompt and then give them a couple of weeks in support to explore this thing to, to create in their own way, with their own stories.

00:10:26:07 - 00:10:46:22
不明
And again, you know, without the stress of having to create for clients. But of course, that all has led to and the idea that it's going to fuel creating ideas for clients, providing inspiration, providing the opportunity to kind of showcase ideas in ways that we couldn't before, whether it's because of time or resources, whatever that is.

00:10:46:22 - 00:11:13:55
不明
And so, it all starts with just kind of raising the floor of our, of our agency skillset and giving them the comfort and the resources to, bring that into the into their ideation and then production of those ideas that make sense. I remember speaking to a website customer, Oyster Air, and they were excited to test out using AI for image generation, but the company wasn't ready yet from a, I guess, like a policy and a legal point of view to use final artwork on the website.

00:11:14:00 - 00:11:33:56
不明
So what they did was they used Adobe Express in this case to generate potential concepts like site maps and site layouts. So it was sort of generate one of those AI hallucinatory images of like your hero image and buttons over here. And so different components across the page, just in different iterations, different color palettes built off their brand guidelines.

00:11:34:01 - 00:11:53:26
不明
I guess curious, like in the work that you've done with clients and sort of educating clients on testing, how are you managing different teams? So obviously there's a creative team that's generally going to be more tested and testing out. But what about product teams or tech teams or legal and compliance teams? How, what's their journey of, learning to use AI like, Mance?

00:11:53:29 - 00:12:11:48
不明
And so we a ways are going at a question like this. There's so many different, I guess, groups, you know, creative that you're saying. I think a lot of what we're talking about, it's it's provided for the wider agency. But the creatives are the real target. They're the ones generating the ideas. That's kind of the approach we took there.

00:12:11:53 - 00:12:42:22
不明
We have a creative technologist within the agency that, helps to explore a lot of these tools. And, you know, we've got some tools that have already been approved by Omnicom and are accessible to the agency, and they're viable for consumer facing work from a legal standpoint. And that's where we focus a lot of the kind of like the mass scale energy, but we also make sure that we're testing a lot of, you know, the newer tools that are coming out and to see what might be possible to kind of to, to can bring into our different workflows.

00:12:42:27 - 00:13:06:11
不明
You know, Adobe in particular, that we've, we've come to find that, Firefly specifically is particularly really good when it comes to like graphical outputs and, text based outputs. And so that is become a pretty key part of a lot of our creatives workflows when they're, when they're generating images and ideas and, and getting more and more so to, towards consumer facing work in that space.

00:13:06:16 - 00:13:33:57
不明
On the legal side of things, there's a very smart bird, people, at the Omnicom level that I'm lucky to be able to, to work with and learn from. That is really kind of getting deep into kind of at the enterprise level with the with a lot of these tools, developing those relationships, figuring out the types of licensing agreements we give to get right access, and then, most importantly, getting to that point where we're comfortable with the models we're comfortable with, what's training those models?

00:13:33:57 - 00:14:00:44
不明
And we're able to use these tools to create work that again, we can put out into into the world. It'd be great to dig into a couple of examples. I know you've shared some, one of which was Bacardi, which I think did a really cool AI powered project. I guess before we get into the details of that, maybe if you could talk about from sort of an overall brand and go to market perspective for a brand like Bacardi, like, what are they generally trying to do as it relates to a website or digital experiences or digital engagement?

00:14:00:44 - 00:14:27:29
不明
What's the sort of general goal? And then maybe we can talk about this particular project? Yeah, I mean, I mean, we're we're really lucky that, we had Bacardi as a client because of the space that I work in, in the Merger and Innovation Act. That's been the space that they have invested in for years now. We've had a program called Music Liberates Music with them, where we're pretty much consistently finding ways to bring some of the more emerging, cutting edge technology into our ideas.

00:14:27:33 - 00:14:49:57
不明
All kind of like supporting the platform idea of do what moves you. And so, you know, that has been kind of a driving force of a lot of our ideation. You know, we do, of course, general go to market and platform type of thinking for them. But there is this consistent opportunity to explore these types of spaces and produce the idea as a go to market based on some of these technologies.

00:14:50:02 - 00:15:09:45
不明
And so this campaign was with an artist, Boy Wonder, and I understand there was an AI album of sorts made. Can you talk through sort of the brief, the process and what was built? Sure. So Boy Wonder is a music producer that works with, I mean, essentially everybody you can imagine in pop, like Kendrick Lamar to Rihanna and everyone in between.

00:15:09:50 - 00:15:33:17
不明
And so with this, like music liberates music platform, the goal, the major goal and driving kind of force with this thing has always been to find ways for, you know, us to take our resources and take the relationships we're able to build with some of these well-known artists to provide opportunities for lesser known artists to get their music created and exposed.

00:15:33:21 - 00:15:55:14
不明
So in this particular case, we worked with Boy Wonder where we took a bunch of his unreleased, music that he had produced that hadn't been used in, for any of his partners. And we trained a model on it so that it was able to output basically net new music that sounded like it was generated by Boy Wonder.

00:15:55:19 - 00:16:22:33
不明
And the way that this came to life was once we had that model trained, we created a front end where, an artist could go to this front end website. They can put in their, their lyric track or their dialog, their vocal track, to find, you know, knobs and buttons of like, tempo, style and whatnot that can still fits within the style of boy Wonder and that it would generate music that fit that song.

00:16:22:48 - 00:16:44:19
不明
The output of this program was a professional mixed song. The demo was uploaded to Spotify. As a part of this record, underneath the moniker of the concept album. That's a great experience that sort of outlines, you can involve the community, give them some tools with some guardrails. I imagine with the way you've built it, that then allows lots of people to get really involved and interested in this.

00:16:44:24 - 00:17:01:48
不明
You shared another example which was adopted, I think by pedigree. Can you share a little bit more about the, the, the brief, what the client was looking for and the execution using AI, especially around the the digital experience in the website? Yeah, sure. You know, that's one that was produced out of our, our office in Australia.

00:17:01:48 - 00:17:31:21
不明
Colenso BBDO was also really well known for creating this type of work. So this is an idea where we wanted to be able to, scale the idea of showcasing dogs that are available for adoption regardless of the area that you're in through this program. Pedigree, pedigree, agreed to or has decided it's going to have all of their online advertisement include some sort of an opportunity or or prompt to be able to go adopt a particular dog.

00:17:31:26 - 00:17:48:46
不明
In this case, what we did is we're able to draw from the API of, an adoption, like an overall adoption source based on where you are, it's able to find a dog that is available for adoption, that area. And then using AI, it was able to take that image and kind of map it over.

00:17:48:51 - 00:18:13:49
不明
What a, a model of that breed of dog. Because, you know, there's there's the problem with these types of products and this type of approach that we've been, we've been trying to find, solve for for a long time that AI is now enabled where know you get an you could see an image from an adoption agency, but maybe it's not the best image of a dog, and it doesn't fit with the overall style and the placement and all that of an ad that you're that you're needing to scale automatically like this.

00:18:13:54 - 00:18:35:33
不明
So being able to use AI where it's going to take that image, understanding what the dog is, take the specifics of that particular dog, that particular breed, and then again, map it over this model so that it feels as part of one larger, cohesive campaign. It really feels pretty compelling that it makes it so personalized and like in the, I guess, in this case, like hyper localized to where you are as if you're in a certain city or area.

00:18:35:48 - 00:19:02:36
不明
The dogs that you're seeing in these advertisements are actually the ones that are in that local area. Is that a key component around personalization, would you say? Absolutely. That's the golden goose with this stuff to an extent of like the ability to to scale and target at a level that just wasn't possible before and were just really appealing at the beginning of exploring the potential of this kind of thing of, you know, that hyper targeting specific to you, specific to where you are, who you are.

00:19:02:40 - 00:19:33:40
不明
I think we're just scratching the surface. So, yeah, two really great examples of where AI tools are providing kind of creative execution, whether it's music or image, really wrapped around localizing and personalizing to the audience in each case. Definitely sounds, pretty powerful. And I guess to that point, what do you think is going to be how will things shake out in 2025 as it relates to how marketing leaders should be using AI, especially to create more personalized or more impactful content experiences on their websites?

00:19:33:45 - 00:19:58:44
不明
So I think 2025, I expect to be a year where you see just kind of the floor be raised in regards to like the individual understanding, but also the adoption of things like utilizing, image generation and advertisement. So it sounds like the takeaway for marketing leaders is education for teams, experimentation, testing things out and then just running and having a go to things.

00:19:58:44 - 00:20:19:56
不明
Would you say? Yeah. And I think, like whatever you can do to to put people in a position where they can have fun with this stuff, don't have the stress of like, this is neat. This output needs to be put in an ad or whatever that is like. Give them the time, the space and the resources to play and get excited and then organically let that show up in the work.

00:20:20:00 - 00:20:26:53
不明
James, thank you very much. Got it. Thanks for having me.

00:20:26:57 - 00:20:48:22
不明
Adobe has a long history in equipping product design and marketing teams with tools to create rich and engaging content and experiences. Marché Coleman as a product manager on the Adobe Extensibility Team, and she's been working with Webflow to bring Adobe's capabilities to over 300,000 brands using our platform. Marshall, it's great to speak with you. Nice to speak with you to a nice to see you again first.

00:20:48:26 - 00:21:08:57
不明
So I mean, Adobe is amazing. It's been empowering creators for decades. And IT website, we're very proud about giving everyone development superpowers. I'm keen to hear how Adobe is now giving everyone creative superpowers. Yeah, no, this is a great question, and I'll admit that before working at Adobe, I had never really used art professional creative tools like Photoshop or Premiere Pro.

00:21:09:02 - 00:21:27:21
不明
I found them really intimidating to use, but I knew that Adobe, who Adobe was, I knew that we were trusted, and so I was really excited to join the team and be able to be a part of the launch of Adobe Express. That's when I truly recognized the power that we have to empower everyone to be creative with easy to use design tools.

00:21:27:25 - 00:21:47:19
不明
And then by being thoughtfully integrated into the tools and workflows where we know that users are already familiar, like in web flow, we expose all types of creatives to the types of tools that enhance their process. It's a really fantastic product, like it gives so many powers that perhaps in past you need like a lot of experience or a degree in graphics design.

00:21:47:33 - 00:22:08:48
不明
What are some of the capabilities? And as you are building this tool with marketers in mind, how did you kind of prioritize and identify which tools to build and how to sort of set them up? Yeah, yeah. I work in a really fun intersection, I think, with Adobe Express and our partners, where our core product team gets to kind of learn from users and dictate some of the core features and see what translates well.

00:22:08:57 - 00:22:39:08
不明
And then I get to take that a step further and explore what resonates when partners are again in the context of their actual workflow and they're outside of Adobe Express. So when it comes to integrating with our partners, we've taken a more modular framework so that developers can even feel empowered to customize their users workflows. And this is why we think Webflow is such a great partner to work with, and prioritizing that developer experience, as well as the marketing kind of user, so that everyone is empowered to make sure that their team wins.

00:22:39:13 - 00:23:03:27
不明
Can you talk us through a couple of the most popular features that people can do with Adobe Express? Yes, of course. So the including some of the features that we have available in web flow remove background, resize image. These simple image editing actions, they're actually powered by capabilities that exist in our flagship products like Photoshop. So even the day to day marketer can do these tools without having to learn complex skills.

00:23:03:27 - 00:23:23:23
不明
Complex tools like Photoshop. Marketers are always asking for more access to content and templates to start with, giving them inspiration, but then they also want their teams to be able to keep content that's on brand. So we have template locking and more controls so that marketing teams can not just be empowered to create content, but keep their content.

00:23:23:23 - 00:23:41:15
不明
That's really on brand. That's such an important point. And I know we spoke to IMB Bank, who was part of the launch of the app last year and how they use the product, and they explained how they uploaded reference files and brand guidelines, which the Adobe Express app website then took into account when it was generating images that were using.

00:23:41:20 - 00:24:09:33
不明
Is that like a common feature you hear from marketing teams? Yes. The need to use, an AI to produce content that's like placeholder images. This really helps teams get started faster, with content that's still true to the vision that they want to represent. So instead of having to search for a bunch of results, you really get to use reference images and refine your prompt, which is, you know, work so familiar with creating text and storytelling that it adds that visual element to it.

00:24:09:33 - 00:24:41:17
不明
When you have, the power of Adobe Fire fun in the work that you've done with, you know, Webflow customers and then other partners. Has there been any really interesting feedback or learnings that you've gotten as to how people are using this product? Yeah. I think first off, just as it has kind of related to how we work with partners, I have been surprised that instead of taking this all in one approach, we've taken a step back as Adobe and we're really thinking, how do we build modular, focused environments so that we don't have users be distracted with AI?

00:24:41:17 - 00:25:00:53

But really use this as a tool? That's really intentional in specific points of their workflow. I've also been really, I guess, delighted by how much users want to be able to collaborate with other people when they're working in express, which is always kind of fun and challenging as a team to think of those live code editing capabilities.

But it brings a fun challenge to us, and it helps us kind of go along with this theme of empowering everyone to be creative and keep marketing teams working really proficiently together. Yeah, it's such an important point that collaboration. So giving people tools and technologies to help give them superpowers is great, but how do they then work with the existing workflows and tools and projects?

You know, even a website? We've been building capabilities for design approvals and making it easier for different team members to collaborate, as they building up sites or refining those websites. Totally. It's so important. I mean, even I as a PM and maybe not our core, you know, market for Adobe Express, but I work directly with our marketing team.

So anytime that they're sending me content, I need to be able to easily access it and collaborate with them as well. So, that's been a good a good learning that we've gotten from Adobe Express and excited to do more there. So it's been such a year of advancements in AI. What are you excited about for the future of AI, particularly as it relates to generative AI tools and content creation that marketers would use in sort of building and managing their websites?

00:26:01:56 - 00:26:21:14

Yeah. And so I'll take this even a step back and say that I have been intimidated to use AI as someone who builds it. And so I've had a bit of a learning and kind of a trust curve myself. And so I have trained myself to always start with where I'm already confident a lot of times that is in this ideation stage.

So if there's a small project that you're working on, that's a great opportunity to introduce AI in ways where you know that you can already, you know, if if worst case scenario, you lose five minutes of time trying to learn something new and test something that you haven't done before. But best case scenario, you have even more content that again, really aligns to your vision and helps tell your story.

I think I'm really excited to just see how more people start to interact and engage with AI. The only way for innovation to happen is if we experiment, and we take new approaches and continue to learn from the results. So I think as we see more people start to be trusted and start to trust AI, especially with Adobe Firefly having, a collections that are designed to be, you know, commercially safe for users, the innovation will really start to be unless it's an exciting time now.
