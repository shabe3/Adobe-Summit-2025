Know everyone. Welcome, welcome, welcome to the top innovation sessions in AMP sites. And trust us, this is the session that you want to pay attention to. First, let's introduce ourselves. I'm Gordon I lead product marketing for M site Living and breathing am site every day and with me today is Cedric. Our resident expert in everything's the. So let's get into it.

00:00:26:19 - 00:01:00:15
不明
I actually first want to start by saying a huge thank you. Seriously, we could not do this without you. The magic happens because we are building together. In fact, just last year, over 90% of our innovations came straight from co-developing with our customers. And that kind of partnership is super valuable for us. And talk about the impact. Some examples that we are sharing here are the kind of business impact and outcomes that we could drive for brand just like yours.

00:01:00:16 - 00:01:28:15
不明
Yours. And that is what fuels us and keeps us pushing forward every day. And in this world that is moving so fast with Chennai and all the innovations that are coming along. We firmly believe that walking in lockstep with you is the only way to create real value. So let's get into all the exciting stuff that you are here to hear, to learn about what we have been cooking in our kitchen.

00:01:28:19 - 00:02:02:19
不明
So let's dive in. So starting with what keeps us up at night. If you think about it, for years we have built our marketing strategies around a very simple idea of this predictable fun, a very structured journey from awareness all the way to purchase and that funnel is evolving really, really fast. Many of its steps are actually changing rapidly with Chennai just in 2023 with generative AI.

00:02:02:21 - 00:02:37:06
不明
It reached deep the awareness part completely, but time to answer became almost instant with AI surfacing the best information just in seconds. And in 2024, with further advances in reasoning, even the consideration stages following the same pattern, instead of shifting to an abundance of choices, consumers are now starting from a set of options that are curated just for their preferences before a brand even gets a chance to guide them further.

00:02:37:09 - 00:03:09:00
不明
So the big question is not just how the funnel is evolving. The real question is what's going to replace that? And how do brands keep up with such an evolution and reshaping of these experiences that they used to control in the past? So today we'll explore how brands can move from this funnel driven strategy to fluid AI. First, customer experiences with content meets buyers in their moments of need, wherever they are.

00:03:09:02 - 00:03:39:04
不明
And we strongly believe in order for brands to be ready for this. There are some key building blocks that we need to put in place. Starting with intent aware experiences. It's not just about the volume of the content that is being created. Traditional content strategies are failing in this era where customer intent is literally so fluid, and decision making is becoming more and more instant and just in time.

00:03:39:06 - 00:04:06:23
不明
So static and dump content is not going to be obsolete. Brands need to put their effort into generating intent aware content that is going to evolve with the consumer behavior and is going to drive these actions instantly. But you know what? Velocity is not enough because of this velocity. And because with AI, we're going to accelerate the entire content distribution across these multiple channels.

00:04:06:24 - 00:04:51:02
不明
Brands also have this risk that they need to take control over, which is losing the control of their brand integrity. The challenge is, how do you make sure that there's flexibility and speed without compromising the integrity of brand guidelines and the compliance and the quality control that needs to be so embedded into these AI powered workflows? And not only this much is only, of course, only as good at the data that it learns from brands that are going to win in this new world will be the ones that read every content interaction as a learning opportunity, and feeds it back into its own generation engine.

00:04:51:04 - 00:05:19:26
不明
AI generated insights must fuel the AI driven content decisions. Turning the guesswork into precision. And this is where AMP can help. And we are super excited to talk about these innovations with you. First of all, we are dialing APM to generate intent driven experiences. This is going to be super exciting in this intuitive and fast fashion for the marketers.

00:05:19:28 - 00:05:59:05
不明
So they are not just reacting to customer needs, but they're anticipating them. And the system itself is smart enough to help them generate these experiences on point with that intent that they are trying to drive. Next is governance. While content creation gets accelerated, we cannot compromise the brand integrity. And there is no way out of this. So we automated compliance and brand standards, ensuring that every piece of content is aligned with your voice guidelines and intended purpose, but done at scale.

00:05:59:07 - 00:06:34:10
不明
And lastly, achieving higher conversions also means continuously learning and optimizing these experiences where AUM can be that helpful. Marketers assisting the marketers to identify the highest impact opportunities and also helping to act on them very quickly instead of wasting any internal cycles. Adobe Experience Manager site helps you unlock these and provide you with a strong and robust foundation so you are prepared for the disruption that lies ahead.

00:06:34:13 - 00:06:57:11
不明
So let's get into the meat of it. Starting with intent driven experience creation. And if you think about this, brands today have tons and tons of content already. And a large part of that is already approved and surfaced in the properties in various locations are at a scale for the brands. But having this volume is just not enough.

00:06:57:13 - 00:07:27:11
不明
Taking that content, whether that's images, text or video or any other assets to a meaningful experience means it's a complex journey. Marketers have to add the right context. For example, which persona is a part of? What intent is the experience supposed to drive or match for the end consumer? In addition, global teams must tailor this content for different GEOs, personas, localization and or sub brands.

00:07:27:13 - 00:08:04:16
不明
Themes have to adapt across different channels as well. And all of this is very, very time consuming. And to get to the end line of generating that finished experience, which is actually going to be a performing experience. So today we are actually announcing a new way of building experiences, but with Adobe Experience Manager sites, a new journey AI powered experience building is here to revolutionize how global marketing marketing teams can repurpose, activate, and optimize every experience.

00:08:04:19 - 00:08:29:22
不明
It enables marketers to work smarter, faster, and more effectively. They are able to discover the best content that matches the intent, and all of it is based on the past metrics such as click through, rate, impact or if you impact of the experience. And that helps them get to that end experience in minutes instead of weeks. So set rate.

00:08:29:24 - 00:08:56:24
不明
Let's show them the magic. All right. Thank you guys. On. Here we are on actually our new home experience of experience manager. But let me go right into what's going on was talking about. So what do you need to do today. Today I want to create a landing page. So let's just describe what I want. Okay I need to build an any page for my Bali campaign.

00:08:56:27 - 00:09:19:08
不明
Really starting with my intent of what I want to create. The next step is there's two there's a few choices that we want to make available. Number one is there might be campaigns or plans that are already in place within the organization. Let's say we're using work from. So you can assign that to it so we can learn more about what the goals and outcomes are.

00:09:19:10 - 00:09:48:11
不明
Or I can just upload a PDF or word document that actually contains that information as a next step, right? What Adobe Experince manager is doing is it's analyzing this document, and it's trying to figure out what is the best path forward to go and create that landing page. So this is not limited to landing pages. Any existing templates.

00:09:48:13 - 00:10:13:14
不明
You have already created in Em will be enabled based on that new capability that you can then start to leverage in a new way. And as the second step here, after figuring out which template might be a good match, we're trying to actually find content. So why do we do this? The main reason is we want to generate a new landing page, which doesn't exist.

00:10:13:17 - 00:10:41:14
不明
But chances are in your repository either you or somebody else in your organization has already created content that will be helpful. Might. Maybe not 1 to 1, but at least to help us. Or help a yes to create better content or a better outcome for this landing page. I can go look for more suggestions. What I'm looking at here right now is what we refer to as the content advisor.

00:10:41:17 - 00:11:19:01
不明
And I can select one or more being a fragments or assets. The whole point is really to figure out what is actually good content to add into the generation in the first place. So I could add some more things here. And then I've seen it. Now what are we doing next is but really trying to figure out do we have enough information that we can go proceed with the next step, which is actually giving, the practitioner here who's just started working on this, a few flavors to really create a good first draft as a next step to good first draft.

00:11:19:02 - 00:11:43:14
不明
You see us on the side based on this PDF that I uploaded earlier, there were a few things that were already detected. For example, what are the outcomes? What what are the audiences and the personas? What which which ones of our brands is involved? So this is always something that has been pre-populated. I don't actually have to do this here manually just because again, that was provided by the input in the first place.

00:11:43:17 - 00:12:12:12
不明
All right. Well let's go and look at those variations. So while this might take a little bit of while we are actually doing quite a few steps here. Number one, we're going into, as I mentioned, into this, selected existing content to help in generation. Look, of course, at the outcome that we wanted and include, the brand guidelines in order for us to, to generate once those first two drafts already.

00:12:12:14 - 00:12:51:15
不明
I'll basically jump in right into, our editor and in the editor itself. I can instantly see how this page could look like and start making further modifications. So the whole point here is I can go and use the share button, invite a few more folks to join, and we can now start, you know, making manual changes to, first good draft here or, I can, collaborate by, for example, adding a command, by annotating the output or I could select a section, and provide further input or further.

00:12:51:18 - 00:13:10:20
不明
Yeah. To, to make further modifications. And so in this case, I said, okay, let's replace this hero, with the variation. Variation three because you saw I have a few variations here. So, you know, I can actually switch between them and see which one, which parts of that page, because we didn't just create a banner, right. We created a whole page.

00:13:10:26 - 00:13:34:25
不明
So there's maybe things that I like from here likes in there. So I can go and replace that. And what what is happening now? It creates me another variations, in other variations where actually it took that particular, content from there, which I like better. So at some point, after all the collaboration, we're good to go and I can send that experience for further approval.

00:13:34:27 - 00:14:18:28
不明
Or for know review cycles. So that's basically concludes this first demo. But what you saw and as few seconds or in as little, you know, in a minute or so is really going from what do I want to create. Who I want to create it for collecting all the necessary information and going back to the all the trusted and approved content that is already in a, take that into account in order to produce a really good draft, then collaborate either with bringing people in or making further suggestions to improvements and and requesting refinements, and then go to a formal thank you Cedric.

00:14:18:29 - 00:14:50:12
不明
That's fantastic. That means now brands can build these experiences at scale with intent and actually drive them to conversion. Next, let's talk about AI assisted and brand governed. As AI accelerates content creation, ensuring that all of these experiences are on brand is no longer optional. It's critical for maintaining customer trust, protecting your brand, and avoiding any costly mistakes.

00:14:50:14 - 00:15:25:21
不明
Without it, the risk of inconsistency, misalignment, and brand damage grows exponentially. So separate. Let's show them how brand service in Adobe Experience Manager site can help take care of these components without compromising speed. So thank you again. Here we are in our site admin where we manage to set our sites. I actually go and go into our editor and I'm just for the sake of showing our brand service and how this really impacts you on a daily basis or how it will impact on a daily basis.

00:15:25:24 - 00:15:47:09
不明
I'm going to open, our generation capability. And as part of that, I am going to, take you there opens up and I'm going to select this paragraph here. What do you see now? This paragraph is here. And I can now start to make improvements that similarly, as we just saw earlier, I can make some suggestions for improvements.

00:15:47:09 - 00:15:56:12
不明
For example, change change this to focus on student.

00:15:56:14 - 00:16:00:07
不明


00:16:00:09 - 00:16:28:02
不明
Yeah. Also here I could give some further, refinements, but I'm just going to give a very simple prompt. And at this point, similarly, as you just saw earlier, we're now generating a variation of that content based on the context of the page, the existing content in an, and, and further that so the benefit of this, so the integration into the brand services.

00:16:28:02 - 00:16:51:14
不明
Now, you see here a brand score. And so let me walk you through what that means. We can rate any piece of content in the context that it's being used, and give it a score. When you want to learn more about the score and click on it. And then you go to review, that's where the interesting part comes in.

00:16:51:16 - 00:17:18:28
不明
And now I can really see the reasoning. So what is the issue with this particular content here. And and there might be one or more rules that it has put in place that then can be understood and or some we can improve suggestions right away. And for others we can really give, a learning and guidance for authors to create better content later.

00:17:19:00 - 00:17:45:03
不明
Now, how does that work? The brand service itself is a configuration that can be put in place, which is shared across all of the Adobe Experience Cloud solutions and where you can maintain a maintained, maintain and manage a central place for tone of voice brand value. And that allows us to validate as across anywhere where content is being created.

00:17:45:05 - 00:18:15:13
不明
All right. Thank you. Thank you Cedric. That was amazing. Which means now brands don't have to compromise their brand integrity and brand compliance with the speed. All right with that now let's get into continuously optimized and high impact experiences. Personally speaking this is my fave great one. So let's get into it. If you think about it, a truly intent aware experience needs to be continuously learning and optimizing.

00:18:15:15 - 00:18:44:23
不明
But today's marketing teams and business owners have a pretty big, complex process in order to get there, which means it requires multiple tools for them to even identify a list of issues and then go through the prioritization. And then for every set of issues or opportunity that they want to pursue, they have to work with, they have to work across multiple teams and personas to come up with a plan and execute on that plan.

00:18:44:25 - 00:19:22:10
不明
And that can be pretty time consuming and pretty complex. But what we have seen from our experience first hand, working with the customers, is that these issues can be resolved much quickly, and they have a pretty big business impact on the outcomes as well. So with that, I'm pretty excited to announce a m Site Optimizer. It is our newest AEM application that empowers marketers to deliver great business impact and continuously optimize these experiences across the entire funnel.

00:19:22:12 - 00:19:50:18
不明
So if you think of the funnel, of course, let's get back to it. And Site Optimizer can help across this journey, starting from acquisition all the way to conversion. If we look at the acquisition, it helps identify and solve both technical as new challenges, which could be related to a site performance and or broken part of experiences, as well as content related to these SEO challenges, including content and keyword relevance.

00:19:50:21 - 00:20:35:25
不明
It also helps making sure that the traffic that's coming from Patreon channel and landing on that experience matches the original, original intent of this ad and progresses them through the journey for engagement. Site optimizer has identifies these areas of experiences that might be resulting in higher bounce rates due to an optimized content that is there, and it will auto suggest and create these this content that is required to improve the engagement and hence really helping marketers cut down the time on identifying these opportunities and then acting upon also in parallel, make sure that it makes sure that the accessibility requirements are being addressed properly.

00:20:35:28 - 00:21:08:23
不明
Finally, it also addresses the end of funnel conversion events such as form. First, it helps optimize these form layouts and structures to ensure maximum submission and also additionally looks at the potential security issues that are preventing visitors from converting and help address those. I know this is the one one of the most exciting launches that we are doing in England this year, and you really have to see it to believe it over, to use that break to show them this metric.

00:21:08:26 - 00:21:42:08
不明
Thank you again. So here we are in Site Optimizer. We start this new experience and that's part of Am as a homepage really for folks to figure out how much can I improve my site. So a good summary of opportunities that are being presented as further, there is a list of these opportunities sorted by the estimated impact that we can have on this and your site.

00:21:42:11 - 00:22:18:12
不明
You can filter this down by the types of opportunities that we're supporting. And we are going to keep adding more, opportunities and opportunity types over time. But let's just dig into some of them and then you get a little bit of an idea of how this works. So I'm going to start with broken backlinks, which is when another website somewhere out there is has a link to your site and you make changes along the way and you provide a link.

00:22:18:12 - 00:22:40:23
不明
But nobody told you? No, that's not a surprise. But there's ways to reconnect those links that are out there broken, obviously with redirects. But that's a tedious effort. Involves a lot of people. So we're really trying to streamline this here. So how do we see this? First, we are to testing these sites out there on the internet that are linking to her site.

00:22:40:25 - 00:23:12:05
不明
There are broken number two, we're looking at which page could be the best possible location for that link based on the content of that site that links to you, which one would be good, like me suggesting you this would be a great way to fix that broken link that is out there. And we don't stop there, but we also give you right away a choice to say, let's just deploy those changes.

00:23:12:07 - 00:23:39:03
不明
So at this point, it's really I doing, let's say most of the work. And you just saying let's go. And that's exactly how Site Optimizer works. So that was one opportunity we talked about. We talked about broken site. Like I'm going to do want to show you one more and then you kind of see them. But they're all in a similar way.

00:23:39:06 - 00:24:08:23
不明
We're going to do one more. So let's go to metadata. Metadata store are a very relevant thing. Needless to say, metadata shows up in various places, particularly, titles and descriptions are relevant for people who are finding your site in, in reasoning engines or search engines. And, they, you know, contemplating whatever they're going to click on this link to your site or not.

00:24:08:26 - 00:24:35:08
不明
So having a really good title is very helpful. And so here similarly we went through the site and we have seen that some have missing titles, others have descriptions are too short. You know, not always. Everything is as well Donna and that's fine. So same approach we're showing you here. What is the current value of proposing a fix?

00:24:35:10 - 00:24:57:11
不明
Our proposing an optimization right away. And no surprise here. You can just deploy that now we understand that some companies have different workflows. We do think that, you know, depending on permissions, there might be a way that you are going to ask for approval first, maybe ask a few folks to feel like this is these are good suggestions.

00:24:57:18 - 00:25:23:00
不明
You can also choose to ignore some. Again, there's a whole workflow built into here in order to as quick as possible get that value or reduce the loss actually that you currently have due to not having optimized. All right. I'm going to leave it at this. But I think the concepts clear. So let's back together. Thank you Cedric.

00:25:23:01 - 00:25:53:00
不明
That was super exciting. So I just want to repeat again that the way Sites Optimizer is able to solve for these challenges is through auto identifying, auto suggesting, and auto optimizing under each of these pillars, a set of agents that are orchestrating across these activities and automating the individual tasks that are required, enabling the marketers to operate in a more strategic role.

00:25:53:03 - 00:26:18:21
不明
Across all these parts of the process. The marketer is always in control. They're able to review these opportunities and recommendations and no change gets published without this. Sign up with the Insights Optimizer. The marketer becomes a strategic decision maker and can start to fulfill the goal of continuous optimization. With that, thank you for listening and we will wrap up our session.

00:26:18:23 - 00:26:21:05
不明
Hope to see some of you at summit. Thank you.
