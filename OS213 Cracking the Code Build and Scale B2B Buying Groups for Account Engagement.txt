00:00:01:02 - 00:00:28:57

Good morning, afternoon or evening, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for this fireside chat on a topic that is absolutely critical for driving success in today's B2B environment. Cracking the code how to build and scale B2B buying groups. I'm Mike Smith, principal solutions consultant, Adobe, and I'll be your host today for our conversation. And alongside me is the brilliant yes or my brilliant guest, Jessica Christian.

00:00:29:02 - 00:00:58:14
不明
In this session, we will cover Adobe's proven framework for aligning teams, processes and data around buying groups or gain insights from IBM's Jessica's on buying group evolution and preparing for and operationalizing buying groups in the B2B marketing. And then discuss actionable, actionable steps to get started and drive alignment with your revenue teams. Even before implementing tools like Adobe Journey Optimizer B2B edition.

00:00:58:19 - 00:01:26:29
不明
So let's get started. So Forrester's revenue marketing buying group manifesto opens with the assertion the B2B buyer is a buying group marking a signif evolution in how businesses approach B2B marketing. Today, marketers need a more modern approach. Given our kind of traditional lead based marketing is a bit too narrow. This person is interested, but what about the account?

00:01:26:34 - 00:02:05:59
不明
Whereas our account based marketing, which came in effect around two five 2015 2016, is a bit too broad. These contacts are interested. But for which products and who are the stakeholders? That's where Forrester's leaning towards this idea and concept of buying groups, which is just right and focuses on the people that matter the most to the key decision makers that are part of the account, and really giving you an understanding if you are, targeting the correct buying group and buying group members, but also the understanding of the completeness of that buying group and what it looks like across your entire company's product.

00:02:05:59 - 00:02:46:28
不明
Go to market motion. Adobe and our customers agree as as well as IBM and Jessica and team with Forrester's answer to modernizing and reorient, B2B marketing towards buying groups. If we look, it's an evolutionary process. B2B marketing is absolving to include these buying committees, enhancing current lead and account targeting strategies. Buying group engagement is the missing link needed to modernize and re-orient existing lead in account management needed to stay relevant and effective for today's modern day B2B buyer.

00:02:46:33 - 00:03:12:44
不明
The reality of it is actually we need all three. It's an evolution. We continue to build on and enhance what we've built over time. It really comes down to having the ability to, work with not only your leads accounts, but also buying groups. And I'd even add in a fourth, which is opportunity data. And if you are just getting started with becoming account based, focused, no better time to do so.

00:03:12:59 - 00:03:42:36
不明
Now, while we're in this process of enhancing off of the ABM and lead marketing traditional, playbook that we've utilized for years. We at Adobe believe this will unlock even more value from our automation and ABM programs by identifying the true demand units that sales focus is on increasing sales, trust in marketing sourced opportunities, and improving marketing cost selling during the sales cycle.

00:03:42:40 - 00:04:14:27
不明
Having a buying group centric approach to drive alignment with sales and generate demand is and is in a more precise way, has been impossible until now. Now, Jessica, all that said, I'd be interested, you know, you've worked, or I've had a lot of experience working with businesses that need to engage these complex groups. In your view, why has the shift from individual decision makers to group decision makers becomes so important for businesses to grasp?

00:04:14:32 - 00:04:39:46
不明
I don't know that, I would say it's it's a net new thing as far as behavioral patterns of our clients. I think it is a kind of a new thing for businesses to look at. We now have the data where we can say, we see that it takes, at least for IBM, about 4 to 14 people for any given product to actually make a decision and invest in it.

00:04:39:51 - 00:05:01:12
不明
I think part of the mental shift for businesses is that especially when you're doing large investments like you generally are doing with IBM, you want to make sure that you have all the right parties on board. So in in our world, we've kind of historically tried to separate a lot of the people that would normally be considered like influencers and the Forrester model.

00:05:01:16 - 00:05:24:35
不明
And we would talk to the developers in a completely separate channel from what we would generally consider decision makers, aka the C-suite. And I think a lot of the data that we've started to gather over the years has really helped us see how the developers are, in fact, informing the more senior members of the company. What is the right product?

00:05:24:40 - 00:05:49:55
不明
Right. So, so that shift has been major for us in trying to provide a unified journey and how we tie it all together and speak to our individual clients as a holistic company and tie it together as one IBM. And I like that notion of one IBM. And also just the, the process by which you've, you've kind of gone through in identifying those.

00:05:50:00 - 00:06:10:58
不明
I'd even say maybe siloed groups, and, and work towards I'm seeing them more as a, as a buying group, or even and we'll talk about it in a little bit. And you and I have kind of talked about it, over this process of building this presentation, this buying group community. So obviously with IBM, you have a huge community of developers.

00:06:11:03 - 00:06:31:28
不明
So it's, interesting and insightful, how you guys at IBM are approaching it? No, no, we're the same. At Adobe, you know, we are facing some of the same challenges that you guys are facing in a lot of our B2B, customers are facing. And and it is that idea of of making the shift toward buying groups.

00:06:31:32 - 00:06:53:57
不明
You know, we just as we've been talking about, we started off in a lead based manner. So lead volume and linear pipeline and bookings to support solution selling models and, for those that are attending other sessions as well. There is another session that I'll get to at the end of our presentation that goes into further detail about the Adobe on Adobe Story, so we'll certainly check that one out.

00:06:53:59 - 00:07:17:46
不明
This is kind of just a high level overview of that. But again, we started off in a lead based format and just got like what? You said this this is an evolution. It's not necessarily something new. And I've always thought this process I'm going even from lead based to account based marketing or a double funnel where you doing both is more an evolution as well as, an evergreen process.

00:07:17:48 - 00:07:43:50
不明
It's it's always going to be changing. We're always going to be tweaking it. We're always going to be enhancing it. And I think that's where Forester's going with the idea of buying groups. It's almost complementary to what we've been doing in lead based and ABM. I'm an account based marketing. So give me that ability to kind of self-directed research with structured account development, to increase buyer, group quality and alignment to solutions.

00:07:43:50 - 00:08:09:53
不明
But again, being able to in a single solution, work with your the people or that you know, your leads, if you will, accounts and buying groups. Now again, this is a little bit of a high level overview of what we're doing at at Adobe. You know, this really gives us the ability, to, build out, our, our journeys based on buying groups.

00:08:09:58 - 00:08:31:08
不明
And I think I talked about it earlier, and I be curious, Jessica, on your perspective of your kind of journey at, IBM and doing the same thing more so centered around the other challenge we had was gaining that that view or that single view of the customer journey, and moving towards that single view of, of a buying group.

00:08:31:12 - 00:08:51:58
不明
And you had shared this kind of current state and future state, architecture. If you could just kind of go through the thinking and, and kind of where you guys are and, and the description of, of IBM's journey, I think that would be helpful for, for the audience. Certainly, one of the challenges that we've had historically is that marketing and sales have operated in very siloed fashion.

00:08:52:00 - 00:09:22:51
不明
You kind of touched on this earlier, and we're really trying to shift from the model that you see at the top, which is very much a marketing is pushing to sales. Right. And in that model, we're kind of operating under independent views of what we're trying to do in market. And with buying groups in this broader collaboration, we're really trying to shift where marketing and sales are going after the same identified groups and then doing it in a unified fashion.

00:09:22:55 - 00:09:43:38
不明
So part of what we're doing, the the bottom half of this diagram is with adding a step that gives us the holistic view. What are all the different touchpoints with both the individuals in the account? And then agile is coordinating that entire journey. Right. And you'll see that we have some other tools in here. Some of them are on the sales side.

00:09:43:43 - 00:10:03:16
不明
We also have some media tools. But what we're really trying to get to is having a holistic engagement that's truly omnichannel, about how we try to move these people through the funnel, right. As we have the different roles. You're going to all be at different points. We're going to engage with him in different ways, but all the parties on our side.

00:10:03:16 - 00:10:37:00
不明
So I'm talking marketing, offering a care product, teams, sales and support need to see all of this so that they can help move people appropriately through the funnel. So you kind of see like we've evolved from at the top kind of one diminish spray and pray kind of model. On the marketing side to getting more and more targeted, where we're narrowing down on that buying group and the activities that we want them to pay attention to, and hopefully sending them fewer messages that are more targeted towards the pipeline.

00:10:37:05 - 00:11:06:55
不明
That's very insightful. Interesting as well. And in reference to, you know, some of the key points that you and I have discussed in, in, in. It's almost as if unifying across the board, and unifying the team, unifying the data, unifying around the customer and the community in reference to buying groups. So that you have that, again, that that single view of the customer journey, to then effect, communication in the personalization within those groups.

00:11:06:59 - 00:11:36:42
不明
So very insightful in reference to what you guys are doing today. Exciting to see kind of the, your story evolve. We also talked about this idea of a North Star, that you're working towards. Again, this I think is, is, an interesting thing that Forrester has published in reference to continue ING to evolve. You know what we've been doing over the years, and striving towards, something new that will really revolutionize what we're doing today in B2B marketing.

00:11:36:47 - 00:12:08:15
不明
Now, for those, on the call today, one thing that Jessica and I did as we went through this process of just sharing, you know, kind of what what we've learned about, buying groups, over the last year, in reference to not only what Adobe's doing, what IBM is doing, what I'm hearing in the field, what what she's doing in reference to speaking with influencers and just speaking with other B2B, marketers out there, is we want to combine some insight and give the group, on the core, some, you know, key best practices.

00:12:08:15 - 00:12:31:24
不明
So we came up with five key best practices for operationalizing buying groups. Again, before you even get to the point of implementing like a product, such as, Adobe Journey, optimize your B2B edition. So the first step that I think we both agreed upon, and then and it was interesting to see, though, we're both huge fans of steering committees and and centers of excellence.

00:12:31:24 - 00:12:55:16
不明
So CEOs, prior to coming here six years ago at Adobe, as a B2B marketer, for 20 plus years, a lot of the programs that I built were centered around having a center of excellence. Which it's interesting now that we've moved to this buying group mentality, or focus, in a B2B world, your SEO could essentially be your own internal buying group.

00:12:55:21 - 00:13:30:22
不明
Or portions of it could be your own entire, entire, internal buying group. In reference to B2B. So the point here that Jessica and I talked about was the idea of, of again, we're not necessarily reinventing the wheel. This is not a huge revolutionary step in B2B. It's it's an evolution. It's a reorientation. So step one for for both of us, I think was re leveraging existing committees, or maybe and I think in one instance, I was talking to a colleague of mine, it's almost, resurrecting.

00:13:30:27 - 00:14:00:36
不明
So if you you deployed your ADM strategy, you know, two, three, four years ago, and that SEO is kind of dissolved. Well, maybe this is a great opportunity for you to pull that steering committee back in to start focusing on buying groups, but leveraging everything that you've done the last 2 or 3 years in reference to your your key target audience, key target accounts, how you might be segmenting them or tearing them out, either that be by industry, geography, whatever it might be.

00:14:00:41 - 00:14:22:52
不明
Enterprise, mid-market, small business, whatever it might be. But it's where we have to start having those, kind of hard conversations that we may have had when we talked about ABM, which is, a manual process. And, Jessica, you talked about, unifying with your the sales organization of really understanding. Okay. Have we been targeting the right accounts?

00:14:22:57 - 00:14:43:14
不明
And now that lens of, okay, if we can really peel back the layers of understanding what truly are our target accounts? Well, what do we feel our true buying group is? Who are the members? What are the roles? How do they act? Really uncovering you kind of what makes them tick? What incentives for them, what they're looking for.

00:14:43:19 - 00:15:10:50
不明
In product, in messaging, and a personalized experience. So leveraging that I think is, is the first component. And then I think that dovetails into the second component. And, and what I, what I was doing was kind of working off of my implementation of ABM as if I was moving to, buying group. And I think it also gives us an opportunity to audit, you know, what we've done from an account, prioritization and segmentation perspective.

00:15:10:55 - 00:15:29:42
不明
If you have deployed an ABM strategy, I've worked with customers over the last couple of years where when I start asking questions around, you know, what is your segmentation or your tearing, or your structure of your, your accounts and how you're you're targeting them. And I get responses of, of I have a list of 6000.

00:15:29:42 - 00:15:54:40
不明
I have a list of 10,000. If we go back to some of the original kind of best practices around account based marketing, it was this idea of starting small. I'm not biting off more than you could chew. In impossibly, I think the range I always worked within is, is maybe targeting 200 accounts. And maybe you're spreading that across, you know, 2 or 3 key industries.

00:15:54:44 - 00:16:20:25
不明
On the enterprise side, I've heard targeting a thousand accounts is maybe where you start. So for me, I think it's it's a great practice. As we go through this evolution, in this reorientation to really look under the lens again at what has been working and what have we been doing from an account perspective. And then again, have those conversations, you know, and look into the data that you might have in reference to are we targeting the right people?

00:16:20:25 - 00:16:47:05
不明
What kind of engagement have we historically received from targeting these accounts in this particular way? And you could pull that from your marketing automation tool, like Marketo, and get that information as you go and make your way towards this, this new buying group centric world. Now, Jessica, I've there was a lot in reference to kind of structuring that that that traditional kind of, foundation or structuring a foundation, I guess, towards a buying group.

00:16:47:05 - 00:17:19:16
不明
So I'd be curious what you and, IBM might be doing from a, from a structuring perspective, a team, as you get ready to evolve towards buying groups. Yeah. You had mentioned, series earlier, which very much excites me because we have an omni channel series. And in that particular CV, we're doing a combination of automation specialist, demand strategists and a representatives from all of the disciplines, as well as the technologists and some of our taxonomy folks.

00:17:19:20 - 00:17:45:44
不明
And that is really trying to set some governance models about how do we want to engage with people, how do we want to plan journeys into end? And then we kind of within each of the campaigns, creating the equivalent of a Tiger team that is taking that broader government governance and then focusing in on the right buying group goals, making sure we have a shared definition of what that role is, what do we want them to do?

00:17:45:46 - 00:18:14:12
不明
What content are they consuming, at what point in the funnel, and then really doubling down on that individual campaign journey? And in a few cases, like if we have to daisy chain campaigns, what does that start to look like? So it's really kind of a combination of higher level governance with then teams that are very focused in on trying to sell a certain set of products in a certain way that, again, SEOs, I couldn't agree more.

00:18:14:12 - 00:18:41:18
不明
I think it's a it's a great way of approaching and it sounds like you've had some quite success, in that route as well. I think your your point about governance, that is a key ingredient, our best practice, most certainly in reference to how you're going to govern, you know, this evolution towards buying groups. And then I think that idea of a tiger group, so having a bit more of an agile group, that you can rely on in, in making this transition, I think would be key as well.

00:18:41:23 - 00:19:01:04
不明
So again, that that kind of steer co key governance in tiger group kind of mentality as a as a to key pillars as you move towards buying groups, I think is something crucial for a lot of our customers, to consider, and know in reference to the other three kind of best practices that we talked about.

00:19:01:04 - 00:19:28:38
不明
It's more of a, you know, now that you have kind of this foundational components or these two foundational components, to building out, you know, buying groups or evolving towards buying groups. I think the other component is more about, okay, now, now that we have that foundation, that team structure and processes, we need to move into building out, the buying group foundation, launching the journeys and ultimately expanding alignment across sales and marketing.

00:19:28:49 - 00:19:49:29
不明
And it's not something that you're going to do, on day one. And it's not something that's going to be an all encompassing process. I think it's more, just as kind of the buying group's centric mentality is in moving from ABM or moving from lead based marketing is it's an evolution. It's a reorientation. I think that's at that key first step.

00:19:49:29 - 00:20:08:02
不明
And I think you talked about it as well, Jessica, when we talked about unifying the data and getting that single view of the customer, being able to reorient your lead and accounts into buying groups, I think is is the key, you know, number one piece for me and even have an opportunity to kind of discuss what that reorientation is.

00:20:08:07 - 00:20:34:09
不明
Based on your historical, data and engagement, from either a lead or account perspective, then moving to that unified account identities across systems and teams, then modeling and leveraging engagement to identify opportunity and propensity, and then setting those buying group roles to to begin composing buying groups in target accounts. Now obviously agile B2B will help with that and it will help scale.

00:20:34:09 - 00:20:56:59
不明
But I think in our discussions today, I you know, alone, really pinpoints this idea of of having these. And I think a lot of our customers I know I did when we deployed account based marketing, was there needed to be a lot of upfront, upfront, internal connue conversations around manually whiteboarding out, you know, what are our buying groups?

00:20:57:13 - 00:21:19:43
不明
You know, what type of modeling engagement and leveraging and scoring do we have today? What does our unification of account identities look like internally and have those hard conversations with marketing sales? And it it's funny, I think my first implementation of Marketo, way back in 2006, they were doing, a campaign where you had a sign, and this was an enduring implementation.

00:21:19:43 - 00:21:46:19
不明
You have a sign, a manifesto that you would basically get along with your, your, your sales and it counterparts for the better good of building, you know, best practices in lead marketing. And I think the same thing is true for account based marketing. And the same thing is true for buying groups. Now, is having that internal, agreement, and unification outside of just moving into using utilizing the product is key.

00:21:46:23 - 00:22:15:22
不明
So use cases create buying groups and identify missing contacts. Establish outcomes, start to identify buying group roll communities. I'll call them communities. There's a big kind of trend in B2B. And I think you talked about it earlier, Jessica, by acting almost like a, a B2C, a company. I think we've we've somewhat over digitized ourselves so much over the years that, we, we focus on this idea of, of we have to target this group.

00:22:15:22 - 00:22:37:51
不明
We have to target this lead. How do we digitize this? And I think through even this exercise as I'm talking, we have to get a better understanding of who our communities are and make sure that our brand is communicating and, and, kind of keeping them in consideration, that our brand becomes an extension or part of that community.

00:22:37:56 - 00:23:05:09
不明
And I use the word community because the community are these sub buying groups. And I think you had said it as well. Just go around your buying group of developers. That's it. That's a different mindset, a different communication, a different community. Then then, you know, maybe something purchasing a different community of engineers, maybe that that you're targeting. So I think that's a piece to really nail down up front and, understand their personas and, and how you target them across different products and solutions.

00:23:05:14 - 00:23:30:24
不明
And I'll kind of pause there. Just to get kind of your input, Jessica, on, on that, because it did sound like that. Some of the things that you're, you're working towards in reference to, excuse me, we're, reorienting unifying accounts and really understanding those, those buying group communities. Oh, absolutely. One of the key things for us, and I will very much say we're in the walk phase, is that we're trying to get all of the data.

00:23:30:24 - 00:23:59:38
不明
And because over the years, across all of our products, we have very many products, right? We have a lot of different personas. And what could be a programmer persona. And one product is going to be very different in how they behave from, say, a mainframe, operator or things along those lines. Right? Just like how they engage in what they are looking for from us as a company to help inform their decisions is generally going to be different.

00:23:59:42 - 00:24:26:06
不明
And if you look at like we target a lot of C-suite, as final decision makers, they're looking for very different information. So now that we have some of the foundation and are kind of manually identifying what our buying groups are and making some guesses at that, we're hoping as we get into kind of more run phases, they will have the data to validate whether those assumptions are correct.

00:24:26:06 - 00:24:44:44
不明
Are we giving them the right information at the right point in the funnel? Are they getting stuck or deterred because we should have done something different? We're really looking to get that feedback loop so that we can try to make our nurtures more impactful and, and frankly, just help our clients find what they need to help make a decision.

00:24:44:49 - 00:25:12:01
不明
I could not agree more. And I appreciate you also. And I know I didn't call it out at the beginning of the, of this slide of of this, step one in this best practice is this idea of a crawl, walk, run kind of process. Going from, you know, having those, those conversations internally, in and, you know, pseudo manually coming to a consensus of what your unification of data and unification and understanding of buying groups is.

00:25:12:06 - 00:25:38:39
不明
And then to your point, kind of led me right to our next next point is, is what does the walk phase look like? So launching buying group journeys. One thing you'll hear in the Adobe and Adobe story that we talk about is creating these micro journeys. And I think you were just discussing that, that there's, a and you could almost even say a micro journey in a micro community in reference to your developers and your programmers and your C-suite.

00:25:38:44 - 00:26:03:27
不明
And if they're not just someone who's going to be, receiver of some sort of communication you're sending out, there should be a sense of community and, and a community around where they fit in, in the buying group kind of journey and the decision making process. So creating those micro journey campaigns that, content is focused on buying group community and member acquisition, buying group evaluation to progress.

00:26:03:27 - 00:26:27:10
不明
The buying group is a key driver. I think you were just mentioning that that feedback loop. So once you have an understanding of what you believe you are buying group, personas are across different, segmentations and products and solutions, better understanding through the product of, say, AJ or B2B, if that's the right target. If that's the right messaging.

00:26:27:14 - 00:26:50:10
不明
I'd even go to the point where I've seen a lot of B2B influencers. Obviously there's that. There's a digital input and insights you'll get, in analytics as a feedback loop. But I'd also say some, you know, community based events, or even voice of the customer. And I'm kind of curious, Jessica, does IBM do, kind of voice of the customer type feedback loops?

00:26:50:15 - 00:27:20:46
不明
As well as obviously the digital ones? Oh, very much so. We we've done it for years, actually. We've kind of evolved from inputs to direct feedback. We actually have a fair amount of community outreach where we either do standalone communities around certain products or certain personas. We kind of look at all of it together and try to figure out what that looks like and how we can better engage to service everyone's needs.

00:27:20:51 - 00:27:47:19

We've been doing some variation of that kind of feedback loop, very specifically around voice of the customer for, I want to say, at least ten years or so, and trying to use that not only to improve our products, but also improve our messaging to individual groups. I think that's that's very important. And it's, good to hear that, that you've been doing it for so long and so successfully, and it's kind of a foundational element.

00:27:47:24 - 00:28:17:33
不明
And, and just to kind of kind of work off of what we have here again, is use cases of developing that, buying group community content, acquiring missing buying groups, activate the count data to create cross-sell journeys. But I think, you know, again, that that idea of that feedback loop of, of, getting a better understanding of if that buying group community content is, resonating, or if it needs to evolve and change by, again, hearing from your own, buying group communities.

00:28:17:38 - 00:28:52:52
不明
So goal here again orchestrate buying group journeys for prioritized counts. Sales of validate buying groups and marketing creates content and nurture campaigns. As a stepping stone in the walk phase. And then you expand on that into the run phase, which is expanding impact in alignment. So sales and marketing leaders roll up to, say, a CRO or your advance use case, activation, that spans outside of of the ones that you used as a find kind of a foundational element, to get your buying group, centric, strategy off the ground.

00:28:52:57 - 00:29:32:57
不明
Use cases around qualifying opportunities by sending sales alerts for qualified buying groups. Understanding and optimizing ROI of journeys, and and communities. I think as we're talking about our micro journeys that we're talking about, the idea here again is to expand buying group orchestration, adoption, two additional use cases that span sales and marketing teams. And I think one thing that we've been talking about is this is important because it becomes, almost like a, natural state within the organization, that you have these buying group communities and it's an extension of your brand and extension of, of your campaigns.

00:29:33:01 - 00:29:56:21
不明
And, and you're you have that feedback loop, obviously, that we talked about that just continues to expand this and align over time. And again, I'll kind of pause there, Jessica, just to kind of get your final thoughts, on these five key kind of best practices, but also this, this crawl, walk, run, approach, given it's, it's something that you're, you're, you're doing right now.

00:29:56:25 - 00:30:22:46
不明
Yeah. I will say, I'm very excited about the evolution both for us as a company and just the industry as a whole. Like part of where we're trying to get to is, is not just sales pipeline. That is obviously a direct benefit. And part of what everyone is trying to achieve. But ultimately, it's really about delivering a better experience for our clients or potential clients so that they want to be engaged with us.

00:30:22:51 - 00:30:49:42
不明
Right. So we're looking at it from a, you know, this is a lifetime value kind of situation, right? You had mentioned infinite loop and and doing that, that larger model to me it's really are we giving you what you need to make a decision. Are we talking to you holistically? Kind of. How can we move the needle in servicing all of our individual clients?

00:30:49:47 - 00:31:09:31
不明
Could not agree more. I think that that was a great way of of summarizing our our talk today. The, just a couple of additional resources. Thank you very much for all that are on the call today. There are most certainly Jessica and I talked about it, looking at the, the Adobe Summit session agenda.

00:31:09:36 - 00:31:39:52
不明
There are, a ton of other, B2B, sessions, to attend to take advantage of, that are very insightful. I think, again, thank you very much. Just kind of wanted to outline some next steps and resources and two particular summit sessions. I think that would be worthwhile to check out. One is ABM and buying group orchestration with Journey Optimizer B2B edition, with AWS on March 19th and then B2B transformation series.

00:31:39:52 - 00:32:15:22
不明
So that's why I was referring to the Adobe on Adobe Digital Marketing story, which is on March 20th, and that goes into a lot more detail than what I went into on the Adobe on Adobe Story today. Again, another resource, be sure to check out the Adobe Journey Optimizer B2B edition online resources on adobe.com. And then, you know, certainly, open to, to scheduling, or having you reach out to either your, account manager or going through the process of, introduction to agile B2B or discovery call.

00:32:15:26 - 00:32:35:11
不明
At the end of the day, we are happy to support you and your B2B ever evolving journey. As we discussed today. And thank you very much, Jessica, for for coming along for the ride in this presentation and developing out. I most certainly learned a lot. In reference to, you know what we uncovered year round buying groups?

00:32:35:16 - 00:32:46:46
不明
Any other last words before we kind of close it out? On our summit presentation? You know, just thank you for having me and, wish everyone the best of luck on their journey. Yes. Thank you.
