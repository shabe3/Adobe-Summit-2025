00:00:00:00 - 00:00:25:10
不明
Everyone. Welcome. Good to see your smiling faces. So, has anyone bet over this week? Anyone play some? Yes. You have. Okay, well, I was down there this morning and I placed $1 million bet that after this hour, Dick's Sporting Goods stock price goes up. So we're going to track that. Okay. So a little bit of an audience check is are there anyone.

00:00:25:11 - 00:00:45:10
不明
Any people here from Dick's Sporting Goods. Woo. All right okay. Well I may have to pull the help line with you guys if I get stuck with questions for Emily later. You're good with that. Start thinking about what I should ask her. Okay. All right. Super. Anyone from P&G here? Which is my alma mater. No one. No one.

00:00:45:19 - 00:01:05:49
不明
How about from Deloitte? Big sponsor here. No one from Deloitte have us. My friends that have us. Oh my gosh. Well, thank you for coming. They're sporting goods. It's good to see you. So. So, anyway, I'm going to put anyone know who's brand. This is the platform for you can't say anything over here. The ex. Okay. Got it.

00:01:05:54 - 00:01:30:54
不明
Now I want to go to the to you all first. And I want anyone to stand up. If this platform has come to life with you personally. So has sports in any way, shape or form impacted or changed your life or the life of your family? So stand up if it has.

00:01:30:59 - 00:01:52:41
不明
Okay, well pretty good job with the position brand positioning over here. The sporting goods. So I want anyone who might be so inspired. Hello. David Shing, welcome anyone who's so inspired to share that story today. And I have to warn you where we may be making this into a podcast. So what you say we can eliminate. But if you're okay with the being on the show, we'll we'll keep it.

00:01:52:42 - 00:02:10:04
不明
Anyone want to raise their hand? And I want to share a story. Okay. In the back with the striped shirt. I think we may bring a mic to you if you don't mind waiting a second. Or maybe we want. Now here comes, here comes. So, as a very unathletic person, as a. Yeah, clearly very tall as well, very unathletic person.

00:02:10:04 - 00:02:31:53
不明
But mind, what's your name? Jolan. Who are you with? Fidelity. Okay, so I work in fintech now, but my career was really jump started, inspired. I got eight years working professional soccer. It was my dream. Oh, wow, I loved it. Not doing it any longer, but changed my life. Met my husband, moved all over the country. Got to travel some of the best athletes in the US.

00:02:31:58 - 00:02:49:31
不明
And what emotion comes to mind when you think of those times? It was my opportunity to just figure out what I wanted to do and like, be really good at it, figure out what made me excited to work every day. Laughs. Beautiful. So anyone else want to volunteer? You all sat down. That's okay. Anyone else want to volunteer their story?

00:02:49:31 - 00:03:08:22
不明
One more. I can go to the Dick's Sporting Goods people if I need to, but anyone else want to share a story so I can? Yeah, please. Do you want to go to the microphone? I'd love to go. Yeah, yeah. Good. I don't know who you are, so make sure you tell me who you are, your name and who you're with.

00:03:08:27 - 00:03:29:59
不明
Hi, I'm Nick law, and I've been an alcoholic for five years. I love sport. And as a as a kid, it was the only thing I was good at. I was not academic at all, so. But doesn't surprise me. Nick. Yeah. Build my confidence. Yeah. I'm dead from the neck up like most convicts. So.

00:03:29:59 - 00:03:51:36
不明
So it gave me confidence and, And the other thing it did, and I think this is a really under-appreciated thing with youth sport, especially in this country and country. I'm from Australia. Is that you? You mix with people outside of your social sphere. So for me, the Indigenous Australians that I knew were through sport, that's how I knew them.

00:03:51:41 - 00:04:13:12
不明
And I'm seeing this now with my son playing basketball and everything. So I think it's, it's one of the last sort of leveling Democratic activities that we can all get involved in. Yeah. Beautiful. Okay, so this is my story, Emily. How. What am I there, do you think? Wild guess 1717. Yeah, I think I'm a little younger.

00:04:13:17 - 00:04:31:44
不明
So. So I play. I was born and raised in Pennsylvania, and high school football in Pennsylvania is a thing. And so I was a sophomore in high school, and a coach came down to me and said, we'd like you to play in the varsity. So that was rare in those days for a sophomore, not so rare anymore to play in the varsity.

00:04:31:49 - 00:04:55:19
不明
So what happened with me in this time? And it was very intense. My whole life was football in those days and that coach and it's always a coach. It seems to be always a coach and just instilled in me a confidence that I could oppose anyone and win, no matter who it was. They were 50 pounds bigger than me, faster than me.

00:04:55:24 - 00:05:12:25
不明
Just he always had it up here. If you think it and you work on it, you can do it. And that has totally stuck with me. And the memories I have in that time in my life are still profound and my deepest friends in my life I shared that experience with, to this day, the kids I grew up with.

00:05:12:30 - 00:05:33:01
不明
So I want to introduce Emily, who's going to join me on stage in a moment. And I have a show, the same old podcast. Emily was a guest last fall, September, early October, and I didn't know her very well. I knew her by reputation, but we came out of the same industry, consumer packaged goods, and I had her in the show and we just hit it off immediately.

00:05:33:01 - 00:05:53:15
不明
The chemistry was great, the discussion was wonderful. I thought she was amazing how she thought about her team, her organization, their purpose, why she made the move from where to to Dick's to become the CMO. And so when when Adobe reached out to me and said, hey, you talk with the Los Alamos, we'd like you to come to this meeting, talk about what's on the mind of CMOs in these times of change.

00:05:53:20 - 00:06:14:45
不明
I said, can I bring Emily? And they immediately said, yes. So that's why we're here today. So I want to bring Emily to the stage with her story of how sports has impacted her life. So, Emily, welcome, Emily.

00:06:14:50 - 00:06:42:10
不明
Give me the old sports high five. Thank you. Jim. There was instant chemistry, and I appreciate you having me on your show. And I appreciate being here with you and all of you today. Thank you, Adobe, for making this happen. Thank you, Adobe, for making this happen. So I'll talk about the kiddos in a minute. But, sports changed my life in hindsight as a kid in a very personal way, because my dad was older than most parents, he had me in his mid-fifties.

00:06:42:10 - 00:07:11:56
不明
My mom came from another country, and I didn't realize it until after the fact. But I and my brother and our family also almost felt a little bit like outsiders, because our dynamic was very different than others in our town, and sports was a commonality that we could all rally around, whether it was the New England Patriots at the time, or the Celtics or the Red Sox not being able to win or local sports, it was something that just gave us common ground and made me, and I think the rest of my family feel included.

00:07:11:56 - 00:07:27:17
不明
So, that's an angle I also think about when I think about sports on the slide here. And I have a dear friend from home who knows my children, so you can tell I'm doing this. Leena, who works for Accenture. Thank you for coming. These are my little ones on the left. And in the middle is Izzy.

00:07:27:19 - 00:07:49:23
不明
She's ten now. And sports has given her tremendous confidence and a little bit of sass. And then my my older one, 14 Natalie has really found her social footing through sports as well. So it's just such a pleasure to see them be part of a team and learn all the lessons of sport and, grow into a strong, confident and strong willed girls.

00:07:49:27 - 00:08:11:43
不明
What country is your mom from? She's from England. Okay. Therefore the accent. Right? Yeah. Right. She had one, not me. So again, here's our plan for today. You just met Emily and myself with our short sports story. You're going to meet us a little bit more deeply before we jump into the bulk of our content. Today, we're gonna talk about dicks and how they're thriving as a company in these times of change.

00:08:11:43 - 00:08:27:20
不明
So we're going to flip into sort of more personal leadership and how Emily is thriving in these times. And then we'll wrap up and hopefully we'll have time for more dialog with you. So think about questions you might have and we'll go there. So not that table over there. Yeah there there are more than welcome. I may even make a mess of questions.

00:08:27:21 - 00:08:43:15
不明
I know you are so so that's our plan. And what we're going to do is we have five questions for each other. And she may not know. She may not know what's coming. I gave her a little bit of a hint and she did the same. So I'm going to let you start, Emily, with your first question for me.

00:08:43:20 - 00:09:12:27
不明
Okay? So I admired your career at P&G very much. Obviously with the podcast, you hear a lot of interesting ideas from CMO is all around the country and sometimes around the world. What's the craziest idea that you ever had that you wish you'd implemented, that you did not? What do you think she. Wow, you didn't have that many crazy ideas.

00:09:12:31 - 00:09:28:19
不明
But, I would have to say, one idea how we didn't we weren't not able to pull off. And this is an idea of maybe for all of you in publicly traded companies. And so I went to our CFO when I was CMO at PNG, and I said, how many shareholders do we have? And it was a lot.

00:09:28:24 - 00:09:52:12
不明
It was a lot individuals, companies, institutions. I said, why aren't all of them fierce advocates for our brands? Do they know who are all the brands we have? Do they buy our brands? Are they out there because they own part of the company? So how can we make advocates out of every single human being that owns our share?

00:09:52:16 - 00:10:14:21
不明
So he just looks at me and says, no fucking way too many obstacles, blah blah, blah, blah blah. But it's a good idea. It's a good idea. I said, can we send them coupons or know something like that? And we were not able to pull it off, so I won't get into all the details. So that's it was a good wild idea that that didn't come off.

00:10:14:36 - 00:10:35:06
不明
I will tell you, I two crazy ideas in my career. I mean, what's the best thing to do when you have a superior product? When you have a superior product, what you what do you do with it? Anyone sample it? Because if you build high quality trial not based on price, you have a much higher chance of building a consumer for life.

00:10:35:10 - 00:10:59:49
不明
So I work on two brands where I said, I want to sample this product to everyone. 100% of people, and I did it with a food brand when I first came to P&G costs $60 million in the 1980s, but I wanted every person in the country of the U.S. to sample the product, and we shipped it in the summer, and it had chocolate in it.

00:10:59:54 - 00:11:25:25
不明
So. So anyway, that's it. That's gone too long. It was pesky. Okay, here's here's an easier one for you. This is so cliché. Favorite hobby or pastime when not working at the sporting goods? So my dream, it's not happening. But maybe one day is to be a professional tennis player. Oh, I played growing up. That's how I also bonded with my dad.

00:11:25:25 - 00:11:47:38
不明
I love tennis, I love to play. I don't play enough, but I try to play as much as I can when I'm not working or with the kids. Tell the charming story of your dad taking you to play tennis with his friends. Oh well, I was in the podcast I mentioned my dad was older and he loved tennis and he would always play doubles with his friends who were around similar ages.

00:11:47:43 - 00:12:07:47
不明
And so when I was about ten, he was, you know, mid 60s. Some of his friends were early 70s and I used to think it was so cool that they invited me to play with them, play doubles with these older men, old guys, old guys. Then I realized what they really wanted was during the breaks, they would pull out their plastic folding chairs and I would pick up all the balls.

00:12:07:52 - 00:12:34:28
不明
They just wanted something to help them become the folds. All right, your turn. What inspires you? Oh, my. I mean, sports inspired. I'm not just saying it was. You're up here. It's why I love underdogs. I love comeback stories. So this is a good time of year with March Madness. Women and men. So fun. I love the early rounds, so sports inspires me for all the reasons we're talking about.

00:12:34:32 - 00:12:55:40
不明
I'm in a interesting phase of my life. My kids are adults and I have three granddaughters, two and under, and I, you know, any any one a year. Not many of you have or grandparents yet, but there is a there you go. Cheers. There is a special feeling when you have granddaughters and and just being around them is uplifting.

00:12:55:40 - 00:13:23:30
不明
The definition of inspiring is lift you up. They definitely do that. It's awesome. So you're okay. Favorite tennis player of all time? Stay on that theme. Well, consistent being in Vegas. Andre Agassi. Yeah. Andre Agassi I had his calendar in my room. I had his neon green shorts in my closet. I love Andre Agassi, women's tennis, Gabriela Sabatini.

00:13:23:30 - 00:13:49:17
不明
But if you had told Adobe, they probably would have him on stage with us today. You think so? I know, I bet they could have arranged that. That would be interesting. Okay, your turn. Most memorable sports moment you've ever witnessed? You're from Cincinnati. You must have seen a lot. I'm not from Cincinnati. I grew up near Philadelphia, but I've lived there off and on for 40 years.

00:13:49:22 - 00:14:11:23
不明
Oh, this is a special one. I was living in Europe at the time. Came back to the U.S. and saw Michael Jordan's last game in person in Philadelphia, and I did it with my kids and my younger brother Bob's kids. He had three kids, and he was he was so close to me. He was a doctor.

00:14:11:34 - 00:14:32:52
不明
I got leukemia at 41, passed away at 50, and I had that shared experience with him while he was sick, while he was still with us. So that for many reasons is the most memorable. So thank you, mother. So great one. Okay, what do you love? How long have you been CMO at Dick's Sporting Goods? It'll be two years next week.

00:14:32:52 - 00:14:56:04
不明
Here's next week. What do you love most about it? Sounds cliche. Love the people. The people there truly believe in the mission. We'll talk about that a little bit more later. Believe in the company. It's a growth company. So it's a company that takes risks, wants to invest in driving. Not just the future of retail, but the future of sports.

00:14:56:08 - 00:15:19:08
不明
And it's sports. So it's just a great unifier. And, something I'm very proud of. Okay, so your turn. So you talked about playing football as a child. What do you do today for sports? Tennis. Just like you. Yeah. I'm crazy about tennis. I'm not terribly good because I took it up as an adult, but I'm okay.

00:15:19:13 - 00:15:37:55
不明
And I don't like playing matches as much because I'm competitive, but I don't like, I like, I like what we call cardio tennis, where it's a cardio workout across courts with a group of people and some pros, and I do that in the nice weather when I'm in Cincinnati five times a week. Oh, wow. And I love it.

00:15:37:59 - 00:16:02:05
不明
It is like meditation. Nothing is in my mind but that moment when I'm with those people outdoors playing wonderful tennis on clay. I just love it. It inspires me. Amazing. My turn. You have a policy of no meetings from 12 to 1 every day at Dick's Sporting Goods. How do you typically spend that hour. Yeah, I think this is brilliant.

00:16:02:05 - 00:16:19:36
不明
My previous company talked about doing this for years and we could never nail it. But it is something that I try to abide by, try to abide by, and I think it's incredible for the company to really give everyone an hour to do what they need to do to recharge. In nice weather, I take a walk in that nice weather.

00:16:19:48 - 00:16:35:51
不明
Don't repeat this. I sometimes take a little quick power nap, scroll Instagram, watch the news. But it really is a reset and a great practice. I think for anyone at any company. Just could you take a power nap in the office? I do, how do you do that? You get on the floor. You have a cellphone? Yeah. The sofa.

00:16:35:51 - 00:16:57:45
不明
Okay. I was worried about getting on the floor and thinking that people thinking I died or something. Anyway. Okay. You're like, you're turning. Do you could collaborate with any brand. Who would it be and why? Oh, well, I'll relate this to, there's a few, but at this point, my life with three granddaughters, I would love to do something with Sesame Street.

00:16:58:00 - 00:17:24:48
不明
Oh, about business and marketing. And make it really fun. Make and make it uplifting and make it real and make it honest. Because one thing about our field, our function. And I work with these two gentlemen up front here, you can just change the arc of a culture of people, of a team through marketing. That's true. And and I think there's such positive power in it and we don't talk about that enough.

00:17:24:53 - 00:17:52:54
不明
So Sesame Street, I love that. Yeah. I think we have one more, one more, one more questions. Yeah, I think so. One more on the music track. Okay. Me too. If we could rewind the clock and take you back to being an assistant brand manager at PepsiCo, where you spent 16, 17 years, 17 years. What are some of the things you would prioritize being great at?

00:17:52:59 - 00:18:17:56
不明
I would prioritize some of the things I think I happen to fall into prioritizing, and there are some things I would go back and tell myself not to do. So the things I would prioritize then and now they haven't necessarily changed is building relationships. That is critical both inside and outside the company, and real relationships, mutually beneficial relationships.

00:18:18:00 - 00:18:40:30
不明
Understanding other functions deeply. They're talking about the CFO. I mean, but the CFO, but truly understanding what other functions do. When I was an assistant brand manager, I got very interested in supply chain and tried to learn really, truly how the products and the innovations we were working on at the time at PepsiCo got to market, and that helped me in spades in my career.

00:18:40:30 - 00:19:08:59
不明
One of the reasons I'm happy to be here, not just with the marketing and the Ecom team, but with the tech team, is understanding that world and their world and trying to understand the overlap and how we can help each other and benefit each other is incredibly important. And then continuing always to try to learn externally and apply other lessons from not just for other businesses but other areas of the world into your own work, I think, is really important.

00:19:09:04 - 00:19:33:51
不明
What I would go back and tell myself at that time is not to worry so much, just not to worry so much, and not to let work become such a part of your identity that it it can drag you down at certain points. That's pretty profound. What you just said. I just pause on that one. Well, it's true, we used to count the months who got promoted faster than us and PNG.

00:19:33:56 - 00:19:59:55
不明
Someone got a month ahead of me. Why? Why that happened? I mean, relax, so childish and so short term. So short term. Yeah. So short term. Okay. You've been here, what, 24 hours or so? Yeah, a little bit. Anything happened here that impressed you? Made you think, made you, that inspired you? The answer can be no.

00:19:59:55 - 00:20:19:13
不明
I mean, you probably spent half of that sleeping. I did spend half of us sleeping, but I had a fantastic dinner with some of my colleagues last night, and it was just nice to get out, talk. It was a restaurant. Good. It was very good. Where'd you go? We went to Del Frisco's. Okay. Steak house. Good conversation, good cocktails.

00:20:19:18 - 00:20:43:52
不明
Did you all learn something about Emily last night that you didn't know? You're. You're looking shy now. Anyone you learning anything now that you didn't know about Emily? Okay, I'm getting some nods. We make it back of the. Okay, it's your turn. It is my turn. Okay, okay. Best well end on this one. On this. Sure. Best sports rivalry and why?

00:20:44:01 - 00:21:11:05
不明
Oh, I mean, I love Penn State. I met my wife there. I went to PNG from there. And they used to have a great rivalry. Pitt, but no more. I'd have to say my son went to Ohio State. Ohio State, Michigan goes deep. It goes deep. Yeah. See I mean yes, Duke, North Carolina Celtics, Lakers. But it's deeper Ohio State, Michigan.

00:21:11:10 - 00:21:33:01
不明
And I have to say that interesting I have to say and it's a wonderful rivalry I love it okay. That's fine. Thank you. Yeah it was good. Everyone okay with that okay. Super. We're going to show a video now that's really fresh. You just had a big earnings. We did a meeting last week with your investors. You created this video I think for that meeting.

00:21:33:06 - 00:22:05:25
不明
So would you like to set this up in any other way than what I just did? Sure. So this is our investor video. Proud of it for a number of reasons. One, it'll show and I highlight the year we had, which is kudos to everyone at the company. It also highlights some of my favorite marketing from the year and some of the commercial campaigns that I'm most proud of, and I think it gives a really good sense of the energy of all of our employees, our teammates, particularly on the what I'll call the front line in our stores who really drive the business day in and day out.

00:22:05:30 - 00:22:18:53
不明
And, you get a little sense of what we're about. So take out your popcorn. It's 2 or 3 minutes long, enjoy it, and we'll come back in a few minutes.

00:22:18:58 - 00:22:40:16
不明
2024 was another incredible year for Dick's. We delivered strong and consistent performance by executing our our four key strategic pillars enhancing the athlete experience, offering differentiated products, strengthening brand engagement and enriching the teammate experience.

00:22:40:21 - 00:22:48:40
不明
With.

00:22:48:45 - 00:23:14:39
不明
What a year it's been. And we're just getting started. The convergence of sports and culture has never been stronger, with some of the world's biggest sporting events set to take place in the United States. This presents a huge opportunity as the expected momentum will only grow by 2030 and beyond. As a company deeply rooted in sport, Dick's is uniquely poised to seize this opportunity from a position of strength.

00:23:14:44 - 00:23:38:05
不明
That's why we're investing to drive further growth by attacking three significant growth areas. First, we're continuing to reposition our real estate and store portfolio. In 2024, we opened seven House of sports stores while also opening 15 field House stores. And in 2025, we look to open 16 more House of sports stores, as well as 18 new field House stores.

00:23:38:10 - 00:23:57:46
不明
Our second growth area is to accelerate our footwear growth through strategic investments in high impact marketing, teammate training and expertise while building a suite of technology tools to make the athlete experience more seamless.

00:23:57:50 - 00:24:25:02
不明
Third, we're accelerating our e-commerce growth through strategic investments in high impact marketing and technology so athletes can navigate how they to shop, where and when they shop, and in a way that is more convenient for them all. This brings us closer to our vision to be the best sports company in the world. Only the US team who.

00:24:25:07 - 00:24:31:11
不明
Okay, Emily. Yeah. Thank you.

00:24:31:16 - 00:25:07:55
不明
How do you feel when you watch that? Proud. Excited. Inspired. I don't know if everyone picked up on it, but this idea of going from a sports retailer to the best sports company in the world is something that we're all incredibly passionate about. It's truly enabled by technology, which is very relevant to this conference in general. And, the other thing I just find so striking, the map of all the sports moments that are coming up in this country in the next few years, whether you're in the sports business or just a fan, how amazing is that going to be?

00:25:07:55 - 00:25:35:12
不明
And just the energy and the enthusiasm and hopefully the purity of that excitement will really lift. I think all of us over the next three or 4 or 5 years. So when investors see that, what do they say? What are they, how do they react? They react. They react well to the growth story, of course. I think they're we're getting a lot of accolades for our House of sport concept and our field task concept.

00:25:35:17 - 00:25:54:08
不明
Did we dim the lights because I said investor? Yeah, I think that was very freaky. I'm going to get in trouble for this. But very positively overall. Yeah, super, super. Okay. You just as we said, you released earnings last week. It was if you haven't followed Dick's Sporting Goods, it was a record quarter all time.

00:25:54:13 - 00:26:17:06
不明
So a fabulous fiscal year. Lots of growth, lots of innovation, lots of spirit. And I want to put up here, your belief, your core belief of the company, the common purpose, your vision and your values. I lifted this right off the site. You can't help but see it when you spend 10s looking at Dick's presence online. So I want to start with this.

00:26:17:06 - 00:26:40:10
不明
Emily, this is a framework for your company, not the function of marketing. And I want you to talk a bit about the role of this framework in building the results you have gotten and the culture at Dick's, which is one which is, at the end of the day, your special sauce. Yeah. I'll take a step back and say, you know, another we're going to talk about lessons and reflections on careers.

00:26:40:10 - 00:27:01:26
不明
And one of the things I've learned over time is how important culture is. And it doesn't mean the culture is right or wrong in a certain company. It really is what fits your personal and what fits your beliefs, and whether the the words on the paper or on the website are real. And what I've been so impressed by and grateful to be a part of since joining.

00:27:01:26 - 00:27:25:32
不明
As I mentioned, almost two years ago, is these words on the page are so real throughout everything we do in the company, through the teammates, through the marketing, through the finance for the tech. Like truly, everyone believes in the sports change lives and the words of the common purpose. And you really see it coming through the teammates, the athletes in our communities, and delivering the shareholder growth.

00:27:25:32 - 00:27:58:19
不明
And then from, community perspective, it's also really encouraging and inspiring and proud of being part of what we do with our foundation, helping over 2 million kids access sports in this country, donating over $200 million, because we do believe that sports have the power to change lives. And there are barriers for many children to play. Whether it's equipment costs or registration costs or access to safe fields and really pushing that and being part of it and everything we do is something we take very seriously.

00:27:58:19 - 00:28:19:14
不明
And as I said, I'm just grateful to be part of it. So the theme today is thriving in an era of rapid change. So could you talk a bit about you're in retail so things change daily. Weekly? Obviously we have a lot of stuff in society now. It's changing very quickly. How does this help you stay focused as a group and what you're trying to do as a company?

00:28:19:17 - 00:28:37:24
不明
Yeah, it's a great question because you can I mean, yes, retail is is fast. I'll say CPG is similar and you can get caught up in being incredibly reactive and going from a marketing perspective, in particular, where the wind takes you as these new platforms come out and these, you know, it just changes almost by the month.

00:28:37:24 - 00:29:01:44
不明
But this does help ground us and stay consistent in how we're thinking about what is our role with our athletes, what are we providing our athletes, and how do we truly enable that sports change their lives and that we help become the greatest sports company? So it does give us a North Star that you can turn to in the moments, in the days and the weeks of chaos, which I think is natural for any company.

00:29:01:44 - 00:29:31:20
不明
And to your point, in a macro environment, it's only getting more dynamic. I'll say. One thing I remember from our podcast, which we did six months ago or so, is your two years at the company or so you came in and you're CEO, who's remarkable, said to you, don't hurry to change anything. Take your time, get to know us, build relationships, understand the business, get to know your people.

00:29:31:24 - 00:29:46:59
不明
So I'd like you to talk about that in the context of how you came in two years ago and created your priorities, your job scope. Of course, this had a major role in it, what we're looking at on the screen. But you talk a bit about your early months and the power of that advice. Yeah, I think it's incredible advice.

00:29:46:59 - 00:30:05:17
不明
I think it's also very consistent with a company that knows what its culture is and knows what will work and not work. Again, not right or wrong. Different. Very different from my other company where you get a new role and you're expected within 30 days to make massive changes that sort of how they operated. And it was very refreshing.

00:30:05:17 - 00:30:24:43
不明
Lauren Hobart, who is an incredible CEO, did say that to me. She said, don't change anything, just learn. Sit, understand and then figure out where you want it, where you want to lean in. And I think I took that to heart. My team could tell me whether that's true. But it is such an incredibly well-run company.

00:30:24:43 - 00:30:48:41
不明
And there are some the priorities are so clear that you don't need that person to come in and change. You need that person to understand where the environment's going and how we can be additive as a as a CMO and as a collective team to that and to continue to drive growth and find those pockets of growth where you can really lean into, it was not a marketing department that was broken.

00:30:48:41 - 00:31:11:48
不明
It was a fantastic marketing department. My predecessor was incredible. And so it's just taking that now to the next level, leveraging everything that's coming out in marketing from a technology perspective, from a macro environment, from all the tools we have to talk to consumers and the expectations of consumers that are changing. Now, I know one of the big, themes for Adobe is personalization at scale.

00:31:11:53 - 00:31:32:09
不明
That is an expectation of consumers and what we call athletes. Right now. And so how we do that is where I'm focused and not on change for change sake, which is a something I think a lot of leaders do still make the mistake. They change for change sake. We're showing us live now, starting in 1948 up to the present.

00:31:32:09 - 00:31:52:26
不明
This is the history of Dick's, starting with one store in Binghamton, New York. Great brands are not built in a day. This slide certainly proves that. But Emily, I would first like you to reflect on that and are there are two insights lessons learning we should draw from this walk through the history of Dick's. I'll just say I was so impressed.

00:31:52:26 - 00:32:12:19
不明
So Ed Stack who who started and grew the company after his dad opened that first store in Binghamton. When you go up to the store and Binghamton, which I had the the opportunity to do about a year ago, it is so striking to walk into this store and realize it truly could be any mom and pop sports store in any town in America.

00:32:12:19 - 00:32:37:22
不明
I mean, we had a few of these where I grew up, and the fact that it's now this almost $14 billion empire built by one man and his vision is just it's humbling and it's exciting. And I think it's just, you know, not to to get cheesy about it, but I think it's just such a great representation of the American dream of how you can build.

00:32:37:24 - 00:32:52:28
不明
Not cheesy. So that was that was it was interesting cause I did that a year in and it was just like, wow, you know, you're every day in these beautiful stores that are what Dick's Sporting Goods is today. And you go back to this first one and it's just it's so striking. That said, we're still a relatively new company.

00:32:52:28 - 00:33:14:13
不明
We're still a relatively new brand. When you think about when we really started marketing the Dick's brand, which was probably around 2010, 2011. So there's so much opportunity and the company has done so well, and it's really got a spot, I think, in the minds of athletes in America. But there's so much more to come. There's a great lesson, many lessons, what you just said.

00:33:14:13 - 00:33:33:01
不明
But any of you working in a brand always go back to the beginning. Yes. Where did it start? Why did it start? Who started it? What was their motivation? What was their purpose? What was the idea in their head? It's it's endlessly interesting. It gives you more credibility. And there's always insights in it. That's true. Now this goes through 2024.

00:33:33:01 - 00:34:01:01
不明
We're in 2025 now. And you've been here two years. Let's assume you're here a bunch of years. So what would you like the next block on this chart to be to represent your time as CMO and Chief athlete officer at Dick's? Dick's is the epitome of sport in this country. And you don't think of that now? I think we're sporting goods company.

00:34:01:06 - 00:34:24:29
不明
But you think greatest name in sports. I'd like Dick's to be top of mind. We're getting there. Ambitious. Good. Yeah. Okay. We're going to flip a little bit. We just talked about Dick's is a case of a company thriving in these times. We're going to talk about leadership and thriving in these times. And we have a great leader up here on stage with me.

00:34:24:34 - 00:34:41:12
不明
And I want to set an overall context about what's going on with CMAs at large before we narrow in on on Emily and I have the great joy of doing a show every week. So I talk to top CMA around the world. We get a lot of requests. We've had gotten a lot of requests over the last several years for me to be interviewed.

00:34:41:16 - 00:35:01:26
不明
So on the five year anniversary of the show, we flipped the microphone. And Jonathan Mildenhall, who is one of my favorite CFOs in the role and my favorite people in the world, interviewed me. And this is very Jonathan. He studied my career and he studied the shows. And of course, with AI, we can analyze these shows like crazy.

00:35:01:26 - 00:35:22:51
不明
I know what the big themes are in the last 12 months, six months and 18 months. He did that and he structured his interview of me, what he called the C print, the success, the C print for successful CMAs, and it's seven C's and I'm flashing them on the screen right now. And Jonathan, I talked about each one of them.

00:35:22:51 - 00:35:49:44
不明
Whoops. And so to me this represents to give this context a bit about what's going on with all of Emily's colleagues around the world and the the kind of analysis or compendium of the things that drive a successful leader, successful CMO in these times of change. So, Emily, I'd like to turn to you and ask you of how do you react to that first?

00:35:49:49 - 00:36:12:23
不明
And I'll stop at that. How do you react to that? And then we'll go on to something else. I think it's a great list. I think they all feel, very important. And leaning into them at different times and different strengths is going to be critical for any CMO now and in the future. I think the one that's really popping for me, that probably would not have been on that list ten years ago is commercial success.

00:36:12:28 - 00:36:49:19
不明
And the expectation, I would argue rightly so, of of CMO is not just to create brand campaigns, but to really help drive growth and enable growth and lead the growth, leveraging all the tools in our toolkit. Yeah. Is there any one of those of the courage, creativity, curiosity, commitment, confidence, community, commercial success that you think right now for you in March 2025 is on fire for you or needs to be on fire?

00:36:49:24 - 00:37:15:21
不明
I think as a team, and this is credit to the team, not to me. Our creativity is on fire in a positive way. We're launching a new campaign tomorrow. I wish it was today because I would show it, that I'm just so proud of building on what I think was an incredible year. Last year. You saw some of the clips in the video with our holiday campaign, with Dwight, and what we did with them, Will Arnett and Kathryn Hahn on the E-Comm campaign and our creative around the Olympics.

00:37:15:21 - 00:37:51:50
不明
I think our team is just on fire on creativity. Personally. Where I would be focused in the next year on commercial success and courage to really enable the vision that we talked about, going from sports retailer to sports company, because that requires different internal partnerships, external partnerships, it's a transformation. So it takes time. And in a questionable economy, you know, day to day, you've got to stay committed to the long term and not just the short term, which I think Dick's does very well.

00:37:51:50 - 00:38:06:23
不明
But that's one I think we're really going to have to do, and I'm going to have to stay true to is there a a beacon for you as you think about moving Dick's from a great sporting goods company to a great sports company.

00:38:06:28 - 00:38:28:26
不明
The athlete, I mean, it's somewhat an obvious answer, but it truly is the athlete. And what what does that mean to them and what do they need from us and from other partner brand to really enable their athletic journey and truly make sports something that can change their lives for the positive. You talked about creativity, being on fire.

00:38:28:31 - 00:39:01:42
不明
Say a bit more about why. What was the catalyst? What's driving it? Was there a milestone, a person and event? I think the team had the courage and the commitment going through some of the other words to feel that we we can and should be amongst some of the most iconic brands, at least in this country, and lean into celebrity in a different way and lean into sports moments with big spend on TV, with creative in a different way.

00:39:01:51 - 00:39:13:55
不明
And so it's just it's a confidence that I think allowed us to get there.

00:39:14:00 - 00:39:34:52
不明
Now, when I had Emily on the show six months ago, she shared four lessons with me that are profound for her and that she put together for a presentation she was doing with some women leaders. And I want to share those today with you. Get to know yourself and be comfortable with it. Find your style or personality and make it work for you.

00:39:34:56 - 00:39:57:05
不明
Set high expectations with support for people to reach them and develop a continuous learning mindset. So Emily, I talk we talked about these six months ago. Now as you look at them, is the list still valid and is there anything else you would add to this, or is there something in there that you would like to underscore today?

00:39:57:10 - 00:40:29:47
不明
Good list. This is a good list. Yeah. I didn't think it would change. To your to your point, when I talked about this originally, it was this specific to female audience. I don't think it needs or should be. I think the first two are the ones I keep coming back to that in any position, you really have to spend the time to get to know yourself, who you are, what makes you tick, what makes you frustrated, how you react under stress.

00:40:29:47 - 00:40:57:09
不明
How you react when you're happy. How you try to balance work in life and understand that. And I do mean be comfortable with it. That doesn't mean. And this gets to the second one, that doesn't mean you shouldn't or don't need to flex that when you're in different situations, particularly a corporate situation. But, you know, I'm relatively open that I'm quite an introvert, which is not traditional for a CMO.

00:40:57:14 - 00:41:15:39
不明
It's not traditional for a CMO. At a conference in Vegas. But you get to know yourself and you get too comfortable with it. And you you make it work for you. And I flex quite a bit in, in different situations to not be introverted. And then I need to retract to who I am and get my energy being alone.

00:41:15:39 - 00:41:38:51
不明
And I've learned that over time, set high expectations with support for people to reach them. This is something that my favorite leaders and bosses over the years have done for me, that it's not a test, that it's really giving people the confidence and the courage to do more than they think they can do, and making sure you're building them up so they can achieve that.

00:41:38:56 - 00:42:04:42
不明
I think that's the greatest gift a leader can give. I certainly have a lot of gratitude for the people that that did that for me. And then continuously learning mindset. I think that speaks to the theme of this this day and this conference. I mean, the world is changing. The world is changing so fast. I cannot wrap my head around so many of the things that are day to day in the news, but I think we have to try and not get overwhelmed.

00:42:04:47 - 00:42:22:26
不明
How do you do that? How do you build time for reflection and insights and thinking, especially in kind of job you're in, which is retail, you have to put it on your calendar. I live and die. By my calendar, I mean the calendar flexes a lot, as everyone knows, but I set I do set time to do it and I enjoy it.

00:42:22:26 - 00:42:47:30
不明
So that's not it's not a chore. Yeah. But you have to do it tactically and you have to do it pragmatically. Okay. I'm going to off script here for a minute. I want to go to your team over here because we're talking about personal leadership. But driving in times of rapid change leaders are really only effective if the people that they're leading are inspired by the vision, by the person, by the culture of what's going on.

00:42:47:34 - 00:43:10:08
不明
So I want to ask you all over there a volunteer, too. What's Emily like as a leader? And listen, she's a very honest person, so you don't have to be political here. I know you won't be, but what you like as a boss, anyone to stand up and go to the mic and say it's cool. No. Anyone else from the contingent can can weigh in?

00:43:10:13 - 00:43:30:48
不明
But I do think Emily is very, very, she talks about bringing, supporting her team and having people support her. I think she is incredibly supportive as a leader in terms of, sharing in the success, setting them up, setting high bars for the team, and then making sure they have the resources to go and get the goals.

00:43:30:48 - 00:43:53:09
不明
So I think that's the word that came to mind first. Did you ever find her napping between 12 and 1? I haven't, but now I sit outside her office. I'll be okay. I gotta get a couch. Anyone else? Thank you. Okay. Sorry to put you on the spot. I have a different thought.

00:43:53:14 - 00:44:14:39
不明
No, no one else. Here we go. Oh, boy. I'll get off this. I just got this stage. Come stand beside you, then you'll get up. I'm actually in a different part of the organization. Yes, I'm through, Emily, but I think what's impressed me and that I've seen her do is really prioritize. And the hard part of that as well, which I think is stopping to do things that may have been done historically.

00:44:14:39 - 00:44:32:36
不明
So I know you made a comment, Emily, about tech being very clear on our priorities, but we have a lot of them. And so really prioritizing and making sure the time and energy is invested on the most important ones is so important. And I think something I've seen you and your organization do well, thank you to that's I appreciate that.

00:44:32:41 - 00:44:51:28
不明
Hey, let's go to the general crowd here, not the Dick's Sporting Goods people, although you can ask questions too. So we have, you know, a few minutes left. We have mics here. Love to come to you. With anything on your mind for Emily or myself? We're both very open, transparent, transparent people. So anything is fair. Games. Anyone want to ask anything?

00:44:51:33 - 00:44:57:46
不明
David Xing, Shinji.

00:44:57:51 - 00:45:17:43
不明
It's a long walk to the mic. Hello, Emily. Hello. How are you? I'm great, thanks very much. I got a quick story about Jim Stengel first. Is that okay? Boy? Amongst friends, he took time to go. Time to go meetings wrapped up, buzzers going. He talked about being a competitive athlete. I was in Milan with him to flex, and we were presenting together.

00:45:17:43 - 00:45:38:21
不明
And at this party, Jim said, I challenge you to this bike race. I'm a professional athlete, as you can tell. And he must have bloody circled me about nine times. That little bastard. So, Jim, do not challenge him is anything is what I'm going to tell you. So that's a true story. The second thing I have for you is within this conversation, which has been delicious.

00:45:38:21 - 00:45:58:46
不明
Thank you. You talk about things that are on fire. I would probably rephrase that in this climate because I didn't know whether on firemen good or bad, but the that's just a note to self. But I do have a question for you. And it's this if you're talking about the thing that you want as your legacy to be top of mind, sports brand athlete seems to be your road.

00:45:58:47 - 00:46:28:37
不明
You're going in as somebody who is and Bill like Nick Lowe and isn't an athlete that's quite masculine and strong. So if 80% of the US population are in sports in some capacity at early age, what are the things that you would say in a rapidly changing time as how they access sport? What is the things that you would say in the themes that Dick would take on that would allow those who aren't athletic to feel athletic?

00:46:28:42 - 00:46:54:48
不明
Good question. Thank you. Fantastic. That's for you. Yes, I then I'll comment on what you I'm thinking. It's a great question. And you're you're genuinely having me thinking about whether that is that is an off putting word to some, to be honest. How would I encourage anyone to be athletic or be involved in sports and focus on the things that may not be, to your point, just about the physical?

00:46:54:53 - 00:47:16:22
不明
I talked to my kids a lot because one of them is not the best athlete, but being part of a team and the lessons they can learn from coaches and friends, and being there to cheer for each other and the community aspect of that. I would focus on messaging that piece of it and not just the strong, athletic piece of it.

00:47:16:27 - 00:47:38:40
不明
So that's where my head is going. But you've got me thinking about that. I mean, I went right to Nike as you were talking about that, and Nick has some experience with that brand. You know, I think everyone's an athlete, potential athlete, and I think they have been very inclusive and wide, you know, open minded about how they express that and bring that to life.

00:47:38:44 - 00:47:59:38
不明
So good question though. Very good question. Anyone else question from anywhere in the room. Here we come. It's, going back to tennis. Is there any other lessons from your matches that you bring back to your personal life, to the workplace? You know, you're about to go into the board meeting and you're like, if only I won that point.

00:47:59:43 - 00:48:16:55
不明
Maybe you can speak through, how those two worlds collide and how, you know, sports. You try to bring back that culture a little bit. So who are you? I love that guy. Where are you? Where? Rob Johnson, avid tennis fan. Okay, that's still hard, but super, super. I have a thought on that. You want to start?

00:48:16:59 - 00:48:42:49
不明
You start. I thought to you go first. It's such a mental game. Yeah, it just is 80% mental and I when I was at P&G, we brought on Roger Federer as an ambassador for the company, and it was in my tenure where we did that and I got to know him and his family and his agent, and I was having dinner with him once, and he just said, and this was at the time the greatest.

00:48:42:53 - 00:49:11:48
不明
He argues, not anymore. But he's so great, a great human being, one of the greatest tennis players of all time. He said to me, I never think about the last shot. I have the discipline to put it out of my mind. I never get down on a shot or a point. That was awful. And he also said, I always keep in mind that in any given day, someone I play may just have their day and it's not my day and I.

00:49:11:48 - 00:49:42:19
不明
And even when I'm losing, I keep thinking this might turn. So he his mental attitude of look forward, keep going forward, don't let anything drag you down. I'm down six 1 or 1 625. It might turn so and you could tell that in how he played. And I think it's great lessons for life, great lessons for tennis and and the guy and I think the other lesson he loved the sport.

00:49:42:24 - 00:50:06:46
不明
He loved it and respected it. And I saw him moved by many things of people who've gone before him. So he was in a career that he was extremely well-suited to and passionate about. I'll build on that. I agree with everything you said. What I find interesting with tennis is when I'm practicing or I'm going to clinic or I'm hitting for fun, I can hit the ball pretty well.

I can hit the ball pretty hard. Lena, sitting next to you is one of my tennis friends. So you can I can hit it when I get into a mess or people are watching me. Can't hit it. Tense up. Mental tense up. I don't like people. I get very it's just so that trying to remind yourself to relax and have fun and just think through, you know, what you're doing is just, I think such a good analogy, not just for business but for life.

00:50:38:08 - 00:51:04:18
不明
Great question. Question. Yeah. Yes. Hello. Really nice conversation I'm having. My name is David. I'm a founder of a company in medicine. Just a quick introduction. So we create, all in one DNA platform. I'm coming from Pakistan to attend this amazing, even amazing, overall session going on. I have two very critical questions. So we are a bootstrap company, and, up to pretty good numbers.

00:51:04:18 - 00:51:24:35
不明
Up to $15 million annual business rate, modulations. Yeah. Thank you. B2C market mostly, in our field of mobile app space and, you know, desktop when you spend and it's a marketing question. So you have to spend a lot of money to, you know, get customers in day one rows or 30 rows return or ad spend is very less.

00:51:24:35 - 00:51:43:41
不明
I'm talking about the B2C market. Most of the competitors generally, you know, raise a lot of money to, you know, make and make the maximum, you know, take most of the customers, right? And they make money after if they later on the year. So for a bootstrap company, how, you know, we should be doing our marketing in order to remain on top.

00:51:43:41 - 00:52:05:39
不明
That's one of the question because many developers have a lot of money to spend and get on top and they get drink. That's one question. Second, as a CEO of a company, I have a passion of music, right? Super crazy from last 20 years. I released my first song as well, but, as you guys are, you know, talking about this amazing.

00:52:05:39 - 00:52:30:32
不明
You know, you guys are professionals. CMO is and you know, and is somewhat your passion how to manage both things. And if I feel I'm super crazy in music as well and in my entrepreneur as well. Thank you. Great. So I'm going to take the first one okay. You take a second one I think first one. So the question was how do you balance your passion for music and entrepreneurship?

00:52:30:36 - 00:52:47:54
不明
You try to find time in the day or the week, and there's going to be some weeks that are out of balance and some things that are not. But I my guess is that your passion for music and being involved in music gives you energy to do the entrepreneurship. And so yeah, I think that's you find your balance and you find what works for you and what energizes you.

00:52:47:56 - 00:53:04:52
不明
That's that's the name of the game staying energized. Correct? Correct. Yeah. And your first question, marketing. When you're small and you're a startup and you're a challenger and people have bigger budgets and so on and so forth, I mean, I would embrace who you are. And you saw the slide up here. We had contacts about their belief, their purpose.

00:53:05:06 - 00:53:32:02
不明
You know, you can tell what that company is about. And everything they do emanates from that. I find so many young companies don't go through the discussions, the debates, the talking with consumers, customers to get to that clarity of who you are and why you are different. And then once you have that, it doesn't often take a lot of money to build affinity with people.

00:53:32:06 - 00:53:55:45
不明
And so so that's what I will do. Make sure you have the rigor to get to whatever your one pager is. You saw Dick's Sporting Goods today. Whatever that is. Because if you don't have that, you'll get very distracted. You won't build a brand, you might build a transactional business, you won't build a brand. Thank you. Yes. All this is a very tall Mike, right?

00:53:55:50 - 00:54:26:59
不明
Hello. I'm Jamie from kilonova. Also from Michigan, previously Unilever. So we've always been. Oh, yeah. Emily, I'm really curious. When you presented the sentences and, Emily, you had already talked about your goal of becoming the epitome of sports and your values as an organization around kids and youth, our country and where we're at right now is in a state of turmoil, right?

00:54:26:59 - 00:54:52:17
不明
With our people. To me, I thought you were going to say community, because sports has always been a way to bring communities together. So how do you, as a leader, make those hard decisions of when you join a conversation of where, like where we are today in our country, given the critical role that sports has played over the years and generations of our families and communities.

00:54:52:21 - 00:55:20:37
不明
Yeah. Look, it's a really good question. Community is a really important part of our strategy as a company. Also, the strategy for marketing, we have community marketers throughout the country to do just that. I think to your point, there is, nonpolitical purity to sports and this idea of community that it's hard for most people to argue with and is positive.

00:55:20:46 - 00:55:42:48
不明
Most people see it as positive for all. So leaning in there and enabling sports, both through our foundation and through the work we do with the company, is a place that you'll continue to see us push. Weighing in on the controversial issues around sports is not something that we we want to usually get involved with, just because we're focused on the bigger picture.

00:55:42:52 - 00:56:05:32
不明
Makes sense. Good question. Also, I just want to say thank you. Every time I go into Dick's Sporting Goods, I see the sign that says no guns allowed and it makes me feel very safe. So thank you. Oh thank you. It's great. That's good. Okay, we're going to wrap this up. I want to ask you, Emily, for one final thought to this audience that you want to leave them with from this wonderful discussion we've had today.

00:56:05:37 - 00:56:47:50
不明
Well, one, thank you for listening to Jim and me. Thank you, Jim, for having me again and inviting me. The world is changing. This changing fast. My thought is for any of the leaders in the room, we don't have all the answers. And so I think we have to go back to the basics on leadership, listening to our teams, enabling our teams, staying calm in the face of all of this change, and trying to wade through all the information out there to have some point of view on where this is all going, whether we're right or wrong, it remains to be seen, but cool under pressure and be good leaders to your team.

00:56:47:55 - 00:57:09:55
不明
Yeah, and one thing I would I love that one thing. You know, this little session we just had here today, a question gave Emily an idea. Right. And so the fact that you're out, you're listening, you're asking you're you're talking with people you don't normally talk with. More of that is needed. And we can't get into our holes and get into our igloos.

00:57:10:00 - 00:57:29:03
不明
You know, just so that's what thank you, Adobe, for making this happen. But we should be doing this more and more because we'll learn curiosity. We'll open our mind, we'll get ideas, we'll be better leaders, and I think I'll have a better world. So on that note, thank you Emily. Thank you Jim. Thank you Adobe colleagues. Thank you Dick's Sporting Goods people.

00:57:29:03 - 00:57:32:12
不明
Thank all of you. Great session. Really good fun.
