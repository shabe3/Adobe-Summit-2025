00:00:00:01 - 00:00:26:51
不明
Good afternoon everyone. I guess I don't need the mic, So, nice to meet you all. It's always interesting to do a session right after lunch on a massive multi thousand person conference, but we really appreciate everyone. Coming to this session and you're going to have some amazing content and hopefully we can also engage you some discussion after.

00:00:27:16 - 00:00:46:46
不明
My name is Prakash Raj Anand and managing director, Deloitte Digital. And I've had the amazing pleasure of being able to work with, Matt and Rebecca here who will do their intros. But you'll hear from them a little bit of story. We're going to get some, additional discussion going, and then we'll open it up for anyone that may have any questions.

00:00:46:48 - 00:01:11:34
不明
So over to you, ladies. Yeah, please. Oh thank you Matt. You go first. I'll deal with to click. Yeah. Okay. I'm Rebecca hood. I'm the director of marketing acceleration at the Home Depot. I am in the marketing operations organization. My team is responsible for delivering process and technology solutions for all of our marketers and creatives who are tasked to deliver great content for all of our customers.

00:01:11:34 - 00:01:44:26
不明
And we work really closely with Matt and his team. Thanks. So I'm Matt Pickering, director of marketing technologies. So my group, essentially oversees marketing data, content management, personalization and activation through owned and paid media channels. Yeah. Thanks for having us. I'll let you start us off. Mark Warner, over here. Okay. So, so the slide here really outlines, you know, kind of our, our journey and where we're going to and what our North Star is.

00:01:45:07 - 00:02:06:29
不明
So, you know, as you see over in the explores and contenders space, this is where we were kind of hovering in FY 23 and 24. And some of the key work we needed to do as a larger enterprise, having obviously more of a direct to consumer business, but then a little bit of, you know, like a business to business with our, our pro business.

00:02:06:54 - 00:02:33:04
不明
So we have, we have a lot of different data, a lot of different customer types. So one of the key things we need to do is get our customer data foundations in order. So we spent a lot of FY 23 beginning of 24 really building out, you know, well structured and organized enterprise data warehouse as we knew that was going to be the, you know, some of the foundational block and tackling we need to do to eventually unlock personalization at scale.

00:02:33:45 - 00:02:57:05
不明
Now, on the content side, we also spent a lot of time with our digital asset management, platform. You know, all of our metadata cataloging of assets and really working on some of those foundational items. Right. And so, you know, now in, you know, we're in our FY 25, you know, we see ourselves hovering, you know, somewhere in the contenders space, but obviously want to gravitate toward, the leader space.

00:02:57:05 - 00:03:18:18
不明
So I'll turn over back to describe how we're going to work on some of that stuff. Yeah. One of the major, components of our personalization strategy is our content platform. So we know that our customer is complex, our business is complex, and for us to be able to speak to them and deliver the messages that resonate with them, we need a lot of content and a lot of variations.

00:03:18:23 - 00:03:40:48
不明
And so we need a best in class content platform. As Matt said, we've done a lot of work with our digital asset management program. And now really focused on content and experience management. And we are implementing am, the thing to call out, you know, we want to enable our teams to operate really seamlessly across this content platform so that we can deliver those best in class customer experiences.

00:03:40:53 - 00:04:02:49
不明
But it takes a whole lot of people to make that happen, and that requires a lot of cross-functional work and a lot of coordination. And I think just the way that we have grown up over the years has not always been the most seamless integration of process and technology. It looks a little something like this. So this is what we in technology call spaghetti architecture.

00:04:02:54 - 00:04:29:13
不明
So if you want to get to the leader space, you can't look like this. And so this is just to show obviously like the classic challenge statement right here. Here's where we're at today. We obviously need to improve, get a little bit more structure and organized. But when I, when I think about trying to get to our North Star vision of, personalization at scale, getting into that leader space basically breaks down to these, these four categories that are represented up here.

00:04:29:18 - 00:04:56:36
不明
And I'll describe some of the challenges that we're trying to solve within each. So the first one being our data ecosystem. So today we, you know, have a lot of different customer data segmentation platforms. CDPs and they're very fragmented by channels. So marketing teams might have one solution or CDP, they're leveraging our online teams, leveraging another one for, you know, our, our e-comm business.

00:04:56:36 - 00:05:14:24
不明
Then, you know, we've obviously got these nuances where we have like a pro business and that's a separate org and a separate team. You know, they have different solutions that they're using. So you know what I always say is I'm kind of, you know, selling some of these things up to to my leadership is that it's one customer traveling between stores online and marketing channels.

00:05:14:38 - 00:05:36:34
不明
And if you're leveraging multiple tools to segment that customer and then internally you speak back to them, you're never going to be giving the customer the best experience that they can have. And, you know, obviously translating into better business performance. The second space is within our, workflow management. So today, from a content standpoint, we have a lot of manual processes.

00:05:36:34 - 00:05:53:01
不明
And you know, those all obviously had backstories like, you know, I'm sure many of you and your companies are, you know, deal with on a daily basis for teams needing to be small and scrappy. Budgets were tight. Right? But, you know, it's led to us, you know, again, being scrappy with solutions like, you know, PowerPoint and smart sheets.

00:05:53:06 - 00:06:17:11
不明
And you know, we we know we need to unify that that process a lot more if we want to deliver content and speed and scale. And then hopping over to our content management ecosystem. So, you know, this ties back to what Rebecca was alluding to. And you know what? You'll see more of the details of this presentation dive into, but leaning more into a proper content management system for marketing.

00:06:17:45 - 00:06:39:09
不明
And you know, that being a, and, you know, all that comes with, with that platform having more consistency around, you know, templating and process and, you know, we believe that'll be a key component to unlock the personalization speed and scale. And then lastly, from an activation standpoint, getting better in the way that we orchestrate those journeys to our customers.

00:06:39:14 - 00:06:59:51
不明
Like like, you know, with many larger companies, right. We're sending out pretty sophisticated marketing, you know, messages and trigger based messaging. But really to understand what the right message is for the right person on the right channel at the right time, we believe is is going to be critical to unlocking that personalization and speed and scale. And there's a lot of data science interplay there.

00:07:00:00 - 00:07:35:58
不明
You know, whether you have a more mature data science organization or whether you're leveraging some of the models that, you know, Adobe offers out of the box? We believe that combination of data, segmentation, content to eventually drive journey orchestration is really the key to our architecture. And, you know, again, whether you're a large enterprise, small or medium size, that combination of Am and ADP is largely I think, you know what everyone's striving after, you know, whether you're using all Adobe products or using a combination of both and are more composable.

00:07:36:03 - 00:07:53:35
不明
But that combination of content, data segmentation to drive the personalization, I think, is ultimately the key to unlock. And we know that we have a we have a lot of work to do to get our technology in order, as Matt saying, there's there's one customer. So why would we have different technologies that tell us how to talk to those customers?

00:07:53:40 - 00:08:17:55
不明
But the way that our teams operate and the processes that they leverage today is also very siloed. So in coordination with new technology, we're really looking at how we transform the way that we're working across this content lifecycle as well. So starting all the way up with strategy and planning. Historically we've had teams that plan how to talk to our customers separately, and they don't always coordinate those plans.

00:08:18:00 - 00:08:36:43
不明
And so we're really looking at how we leverage this marketing strategy to really figure out how to pull it through and individual channels, which do need their own strategy as well, and then sort out how to hand over a cohesive intake or strategy or brief to a creative team who will be able to take that, and execute on it.

00:08:36:48 - 00:09:05:00
不明
And this creative and content production space, we're doing a lot of work, obviously, implementing a for our, email and pay paid media channels. But it's a new tool. They don't leverage this tool today. They've got like 5 or 6 different tools that they're leveraging to build this content. So for us to really push toward content reuse and to enable them to be faster and to really increase the speed to market, we have to build operations and process and really change the way that they're working today.

00:09:05:00 - 00:09:25:05
不明
So there's a lot of process work happening here. The goal really is to create more variations of content so we can speak to more audiences in a more personalized way. With incremental content variations. We're going to need to be able to activate, publish, and really deliver that. So that's an increase on the teams that do this work.

00:09:25:10 - 00:09:51:52
不明
So really looking at eventually optimizing a lot of this with technology, which Matt can talk about in a second, but we're also looking at how can we just make the processes that they have today, more efficient. How can we automate where it makes sense? And then really underpinning all of this with the metadata that's needed for us to both track performance, give our measurement program more capabilities to glean insights that we haven't had access to in the past.

00:09:52:28 - 00:10:17:06
不明
And we also know that that data foundation is really important for us to be able to automate processes across, the entire content lifecycle as well as leverage AI. So really setting the foundation for how we're going to do that. And then because we're changing and really transforming the way that we're working across this entire content lifecycle, we need to really upgrade our workflow management program that we have today.

00:10:17:06 - 00:10:32:49
不明
So we leverage work front. It works great. But it has grown up with us in this siloed way. And so really making sure we can break down those barriers and using the technology to help us do that, is important. So that will be really key for us when it comes from when it comes to a planning process.

00:10:33:12 - 00:10:54:45
不明
How we track the projects through their lifecycle as well as manage all of our resources. So a lot of work happening across the content lifecycle. And we're really looking to anchor around that implementation of a, to really drive a lot of this change. And so that's sort of been the catalyst for how we're planning on implementing this and rolling it out.

00:10:54:50 - 00:11:33:16
不明
Okay. Thanks. So, so we talked a lot about the, you know, kind of the The wire and the why. So this slide focus a little bit more tactically on on the how and, you know, how we're rolling out our implementation of a, So phase one has really been focused on getting the foundation right, building those scalable, templates and components that will set us up, you know, to expand to, you know, whichever channels we want to push into, whichever, you know, kind of variants of email and paid social, we eventually evolve into, so we're, we're actually working on, on wrapping that up within the next few weeks, I

00:11:33:16 - 00:11:56:49
不明
think. I think we're down to weeks, not not even months at this point. So that'll that'll be great. So that's a to knock that out. And, and I think just showcasing value internally. Right. So like, you know, with, with any implementation it's, it's a mixture of selling the vision but also showcasing these iterative value drops to leadership to say, you know, look at, you know, what we've done in a short period of time.

00:11:56:49 - 00:12:33:31
不明
Look at the value this is creating and showcasing how that's eventually going to achieve the, longer term vision. So then our phase two is is largely going to be focused on building more scale, build building, you know, kind of working off that foundation, scaling out to more email campaigns, more paid social campaigns, but at the same time making sure that these parallel tracks of some of our CDP enterprise CDP work and am are eventually going to converge into one and get us to more journey orchestration and personalization at scale.

00:12:34:06 - 00:13:02:20
不明
In parallel with AMM, as I mentioned, some of the data challenges, we've also kicked off more of an enterprise, CDP. Workstream try to combine some of those, you know, different channels, siloed challenges that we have. And so one more cohesive solution, that's still, you know, running a little bit behind where I am is but I think we really want to make sure that we're thinking about those two things holistically versus in silos.

00:13:02:20 - 00:13:36:38
不明
And then, phase three, you know, is a little bit more blue skies. But but I think, you know, when you hear the keynote this morning around some of the gen AI capabilities, you know, I think we clearly see both the you know, the content space as well as the customer segmentation space, eventually taking on a lot more of the AI capabilities, making, you know, people's jobs a lot more, simplified and efficient and ultimately getting, you know, content and messaging in the hands of the right customers, through the right channels.

00:13:36:43 - 00:14:03:13
不明
So, you know, more tactically wanted to talk about, outcomes. Right. And okay, like, why does all this work that we're telling you about matter? Right. So, within this space on, on the left, within email and paid social really improving campaigns, speed to market. And building these flexible, reusable templates. You know, as Rebecca described, there's just a lot of manual process in place.

00:14:03:18 - 00:14:27:36
不明
And this will greatly streamline, people's jobs internally. A lot better operating efficiency. But again, it all ties back to the customer. Right. Like if if internally we are working more efficiently to get campaigns out the door in a more timely manner, with the right content, the customer is going to get a better experience and ultimately right in a, you know, a retail business.

00:14:27:36 - 00:14:49:31
不明
It's obviously all about all about the customer and delivering those experiences. And then within the social channels, driving more omnichannel, you know, engagement and some of that upper mid funnel strategy. And, you know, how we can kind of keep that messaging cohesive between all of these different channels. And then, Rebecca, I think you want to promote more.

00:14:49:44 - 00:15:12:52
不明
Yeah. I think from a, you know, the outcome standpoint, when we talk about making things faster, just to put some context around what we're doing with this phase one implementation, our goal is really to take there are a lot of different campaigns with different levels of complexity. Our goal is to take something that might have taken us ten weeks and our previous world, to take six weeks.

00:15:12:57 - 00:15:33:21
不明
So we're looking to trim that by about four weeks with the implementation of a lot of process, some automation, and then am and then obviously as we move over to the right side of the screen, which Matt will talk to you about, we'll look to shave additional time off of some of those standard timelines that we have. Yeah, yeah, I know I had a little on a little bit of this in the last slide, slide.

00:15:33:21 - 00:15:55:12
不明
But we, we really believe the CDP in orchestration is know going to be unlock to more of those individualized personalized journeys. And for us like we're in a very, you know, unique business where our customers are really organically traveling between stores and site, whereas with a lot of other businesses like I think like that can be more for travel, maybe, or an e-commerce first business.

00:15:55:12 - 00:16:17:22
不明
We want to build more of a brick and mortar presence or vice versa. You've traditionally been brick and mortar trying to build e-commerce, so for us, I think it's really key to engage and retain our customers by having that connective tissue, you know, between going where they shop. Right? So I mean, you know, for example, I could be more of a digital first customer or something even more of a store's first customer.

00:16:17:56 - 00:16:39:10
不明
And especially with the assortment that we offer at Home Depot, there's always an opportunity to either, you know, cross-sell folks or, you know, pair them up with a different product segment or just understand more about who they are and what they do. Obviously, with, you know, springtime coming up, you know, maybe I, you know, you understand that I go in and I, you know, buy mulch and fertilizer.

00:16:39:10 - 00:17:09:41
不明
So, you know, maybe I need some lawn tools or a lawn machine. Right. But, serving that more personalized, marketing is just giving the customer a better experience and help them helping them think less about what they need and make that shopping, experience, easier and less friction filled. Yeah. And we have a lot we have a lot of work to do from a technology standpoint, but really just putting a point on the fact that we have to prepare our teams to really operate in the same way.

00:17:09:43 - 00:17:34:54
不明
So just like to say we have this type of spaghetti workflow tech architecture today. But really when we look at enhancing the technology to build more cohesive experiences for our customers, we have to prepare people to do the same and to build the strategies and to build enough content, to, to meet those needs as well. Yeah. And I'll, I'll get I'll give a shout out here to our Deloitte partners.

00:17:35:33 - 00:17:59:36
不明
So, you know, Deloitte has been with us and, you know, working on the Am implementation, but they've also helped us with some of the strategic thinking, you know, through kind of the the scale and reach they have and industry expertise. So they've been really great partners. You know, working alongside us on the am am implementation. And what I've really loved about the partnership is that they're also teaching us how to fish for ourselves.

00:17:59:36 - 00:18:23:33
不明
Right. So, you know, eventually the goal is that, you know, we transition some of this work to our internal FTAs and staff up teams and build out skill sets, because whether or not within my tech team, you know, just being honest, I didn't have any Am people, so to speak, to to start. Right. So you know, we needed to onboard those skill sets, train up people who are already in in seats.

00:18:23:33 - 00:18:58:50
不明
And I think, you know, they've just been great partners in helping us think through the strategy, but also helping us, you know, eventually take the take the baton when we're ready. Yeah. So, to kind of sum it up, this is where we are today. We've talked a lot about all the work that we need to do to improve it and where we're trying to go is just a more streamlined, cohesive workflow, where the people can leverage the energy they need to deliver the best customer experiences that we can.

00:18:58:55 - 00:19:30:43
不明
So, thank you, Matt and Rebecca. So hopefully that that at least some the content was insightful. I wanted to just start off asking a couple of quick questions, and then we'll open it up to the audience. If you all have want to think about some some questions to ask. As we've gone through this journey, I was actually thinking back, it's been almost a year since we kind of got through this journey to thinking about some of the requirements and use cases and going through the process and all of that.

00:19:30:48 - 00:19:54:31
不明
I know that for us and our team, there's been a lot of lessons learned that we've been able to take away, coming out of the the year or so. And as we go through the rest of the phases here, lessons learned for you. Rebecca, I want to start in there. Yeah. I think, really making sure that we sell the value and get everybody on board is really important.

00:19:55:28 - 00:20:18:21
不明
There's a lot of change and that is very difficult for people to adjust to. And it's not just the technology and training is not going to fix it, and documentation is not going to fix it. It's really about people understanding where we're going, why we're going there, and what we need to do. So we need them to understand what change where asking them to do.

00:20:18:23 - 00:20:36:54
不明
We need them to understand why they need to do it and want to, and then really have all of the knowledge and ability, like Matt was mentioning earlier, they need to be able to adopt. And so I think, moving forward will be really important for us to continue to drive value and drive alignment. Would you add anything, Matt, or do you have.

00:20:36:59 - 00:21:04:21
不明
Yeah, I mean, I echo off that. I mean, I think what comes to mind for me is just instilling, teams and functions, people to think with an enterprise mindset. You know, and I was describing one of the previous slides of how, you know, we've got a bunch of siloed solutions by function. Right? I think you got to remember the historical context that people built those tools out for a reason and are very passionate behind them, and it might serve the one need for their function.

00:21:04:21 - 00:21:24:03
不明
Really well. But again, if you're thinking about Home Depot as a whole, right, and what's best for the consumer, what's best for Home Depot's business as a whole? Excuse me, you got to think with an enterprise mindset, right? So I think it's like it can be tough at times, I think, for, for folks to adjust that way.

00:21:24:57 - 00:21:50:06
不明
But I think it's really critical to achieving the goals. And the mission. And then the other thing I'll say is, is, you know, just making sure you have the right ecosystem set up, even, you know, outside of your working teams, whether it's with, implementation partner, obviously with the right support from Adobe and their folks, Adobe's obviously a big company, right?

00:21:50:06 - 00:22:20:35
不明
There's a lot of different departments and roles navigate through. But I think, you know, in addition to partners like Deloitte, I think Adobe can be really helpful. And their team is really powerful. You know, if you understand how to how to navigate between, you know, customer success teams and architecture teams and your account teams. So I think really getting that structured from the start and how the whole collective team is going to operate, leaning into something like this, I think was was a big key for us.

00:22:20:40 - 00:22:52:28
不明
Yeah. I mean, that last point is so important. I think, I know a lot of you sitting in the audience, are either have gone through a transmission or are, you know, about to embark on one, one of the thing or, I guess, two things that that really stood out for me was obviously our partnership. And then partnering with Adobe, as we were kind of building out what that that roadmap and a plan, was going to look like that work really cohesively and effectively, like we obviously had to fine tune it over a couple of iterations.

00:22:52:28 - 00:23:14:01
不明
That worked well. But the second thing was, which I think having spent a little over 12 years in sort of the Adobe space and, you know, this is probably my 20th year in sort of the CMS Dxp space and having seen so many retailers and CPGs having gone through this, the difference in our journey was we were very intentional at every step of the process.

00:23:14:06 - 00:23:40:30
不明
We're like, listen, we have to do this. Time is of the essence, but let's do this right. That that was the sort of the key critical component. And so every organization undergoing a transformation like this are going to have roadblocks and missteps. But at every step of the way, we took the time to say, okay, listen, we have to move fast, but let's also do the right thing because we are building for what needs to be, an extensible and reusable future.

00:23:40:30 - 00:24:05:08
不明
So that was also key, something that was important for me. Last thing, kind of ask you, building off of the keynote, the, the demo, those of you were there for the keynote, the last product demo that they did. You know, the three of us we caught up after at lunch, we're like, hey, they hit on a lot of the points that we're actually doing as part of our transformation journey.

00:24:05:13 - 00:24:27:18
不明
Gen studio for performance, marketing and content ops and everything else. Rebecca, start with you again. Like, vision excited early days. Obviously that two hours after the kick. All right. So really excited. This isn't going to solve all of our problems. Right. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. No, I think it really was eye validating, I think for the plan that we've put together, we know we have a lot of foundational work.

00:24:27:21 - 00:24:54:45
不明
There's a lot of foundational technology. We need our teams to be able to adapt and adjust to the new, you know, capabilities that are going to have. And that's really kind of that phase three of the implementation that Matt was talking about, you know, setting the foundation, building the capabilities across CDP orchestration layer. And then, yeah, Jen Studio just looks really exciting and particularly excited about capabilities within, paid social, which is always, can be difficult.

00:24:54:54 - 00:25:18:25
不明
So yeah. And for me, I think what, what stood out the most was just really how Adobe framed up like the harmonization of AP and am, I mean, and going back to what I was saying earlier and then this is the exact way that I pitched to my leadership internally, but it's the combination of the data component and the content component that's really going to drive personalization at speed and scale.

00:25:18:34 - 00:25:42:37
不明
And if you distill it that way and then look at how Adobe set up with AP and Am and again, it's modular, right? So you don't have to be invested in the complete Adobe stock, even though I'm sure right. Sitting at Adobe Conference, we you know, we lean that way. But, but but but but anyway, I think it's really just key to like to, to think about it through the those two tracks.
