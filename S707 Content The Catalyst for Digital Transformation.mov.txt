00:00:01:08 - 00:00:22:56

Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to today's session. Just before I started, I just wanted to let you know we've had a bit of a content velocity issue. Our, presentations didn't make it into the Adobe system for today. So, colleagues, this first lap time, just to show some visualizations. But I want to be respectful of your time that you've given us.

00:00:23:01 - 00:00:52:03
不明
So we'll be making a quick start. So in in context to today's session, I just wanted to cover off a quick prelude on how we all know and listening in today's sessions. And before arriving to the summit, how AI is is essentially reshaping marketing and the customer experience management process. And it's essentially offering us new opportunities to scale our marketing initiatives and drive significant innovation.

00:00:52:08 - 00:01:20:30
不明
You know, where are we seeing the transformative effects lying between the integration of creativity, workflow processes for content, tech and data, and which is driving brands into a new area and enhancing the customer fronts, centricity, but predominantly on the operating model and how the operating model is starting to integrate ethical AI practices across to enhance productivity, drive deeper engagement.

00:01:20:34 - 00:01:51:18
不明
But more importantly is how do we unlock efficiencies within the ecosystem to drive investment, to drive growth? And it's in this context that I'd like to, drive the conversation today. So introducing to to me on my left, on, on on your right, I'd like to introduce Claudia. Claudia is, director of the Innovation studio at AT&T. Thom Portman, joins us as, group vice president and head of digital channels for, digital channels for AB.

00:01:51:23 - 00:02:22:16
不明
And we've got Wendy Rogers, global head of delivery. For digital experience, everything from creativity right through to marketing technology stocks with Adobe to marketing operations for invoices. So just to start in, in this context, just to start with, with Tom wanted to ask you, you know, in your area how are you prioritizing and tailoring your, your products, the services and the journeys to your different audiences and personas?

00:02:22:17 - 00:02:43:08
不明
So before oh, wow, that's loud. Okay. Before we even do that, the three of us are going to move over there because I'm conscious that the people on this side of the room can't see us sound guy. If we're getting them feedback, it's all your fault. But, Yes. Good afternoon everybody. Remind me of the question, Bruno.

00:02:43:08 - 00:03:04:09
不明
And then we're going to keep on looking over to you. It's going to be like talking to the head teacher. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So it's essentially, you know, when you when you're thinking of of I can I scalability innovation. How are you. Whoa. Are you okay. How are you prioritizing. You know, the content and the journeys for the different personas and segments.

00:03:04:13 - 00:03:40:21
不明
So let's just put this into context for, for maybe this we're made up of 19 different divisions. We've got presence in 98 different countries around the world. And that gives us a huge, you know, 19 different go to markets with with that across across AB. So already we're starting to look at how we differentiate for each of our divisions because we've got lead times for sales that happen in a matter of seconds, matter of minutes for some of our fast moving products through to sell, sales lead times that take you know, years for some of some of the things that we sell.

00:03:40:26 - 00:04:06:12
不明
So we need to be looking at that differently for each of our divisions. We need to be looking at that, you know, very specifically for our customers. And the way that we're working through that within AB is looking at that division by division, what is their specific go to market and how do you deal with that now from a personalization side of things, were very much at the beginning of that journey and looking at, well, how do we deal with those different go to markets?

00:04:06:12 - 00:04:40:58
不明
How can we inject AI into that to speed up? And we're we're very much going through, you know, personalization, proof of concept at the moment. I think the big thing around that for for us is we need to learn quickly. I don't believe in the term fail fast or would rather learn quickly with that, what's working, what isn't working, and then move on from from that perspective and with 19 divisions, with that global spread, we need to be thinking about, well, what is it from our customers, specifically those territories and getting clusters to them, but then also recognizing that one size doesn't fit all.

00:04:40:58 - 00:05:06:30
不明
And I think, what was it, James Quincy's conversation this morning in the in the keynote, I thought was was very apt that, you know, one person's experience of Coca-Cola in one country is very different to in another country. And that's the same in AB, maybe not as much with having it over dinner, but you know, what they need from from us as a business will be very different in China compared to in Europe, compared to in the in the state.

00:05:06:30 - 00:05:30:20
不明
So very much on the beginning of that journey digitally, but, you know, looking to learn quickly in that space. Fantastic. Thanks, Tom and Claudia. From your perspective, if you could just describe the audience, your role at AT&T and, you know, how are you addressing and prioritizing? You know, your products, your services, your accessories in, in the sea of sameness that you're competing against?

00:05:30:25 - 00:05:58:49
不明
Yeah. So for AT&T, when we talk about content, it's just so important to understand what are the needs of the consumer and to also understand what is their intent. So we can match that intent. We have millions of visitors that come to the website on a daily basis, and we know that 85% of those visitors end up in a transaction, not necessarily in digital, but 85% touches digital.

00:05:59:00 - 00:06:21:29
不明
So it is extremely important to understand what is that content that we're putting in front of our customers on every single channel, and how that content needs to be cohesive from all of the different touchpoints and understanding. If I start in retail, how can I finish in digital or vice versa? So we start seeing that omnichannel need for a seamless customer journey.

00:06:21:34 - 00:06:50:47
不明
Fantastic. And been there. From your perspective, how are you finding or what strategies are you finding most useful? You know, we've heard from Tom very different industry to AT&T, but what are the common strategies that you would like to share with the audience that's delivering, you know, content velocity outcomes? Yeah. So, we tried to focus on three things, primarily on how we can bring value to the customer, how we can engage, and how we can really understand the need of the customer.

00:06:50:47 - 00:07:23:24
不明
When I say value, it's about finding the, differentiation that we can bring into the customer. And we do that by multiple things. One is, of course, we do it by, bringing in, the focus that we need in. And then, second, it's all about, kind of bringing the transformation that they need. So for that, we take a consultative approach about being a consultant, being a personal advisor to the customer, bringing the right, stories that we can show on how we have effectively done it, as well as, you know, the transformation, examples that we can bring in with the latest technologies.

00:07:23:24 - 00:07:53:40
不明
And it's all definitely about bringing in creativity and technology together, which drives the whole differentiation. Fantastic. So I think just in summary, we, we, we listening in on what are some of the foundational approaches and strategies to deliver content journeys to personas? But what I think be a good topic to address once you've got the foundations of your data, specifically your data and tech, what opportunities are you envisaging in your industry term for gen AI or the use of AI specifically?

00:07:53:45 - 00:08:17:56
不明
So yeah, I think it's a good point that the way that we're we're rolling out from a, an online transformation perspective across AB is very much getting those foundations in place, very much getting those, you know, more content. And of course, that's made up of data foundations in place across consistently across our business. And then our next step is then how can we accelerate that.

00:08:17:56 - 00:08:40:26
不明
So, you know, over the last was it 2 or 3 years we've been building the foundational capability so that our divisions can start migrating over to that. It's the year of migration for us this year. Where is the next release that we're going to be bringing you through? Is where can we inject AI into that experience so that we can be used in general AI for content creation and speeding that up?

00:08:40:39 - 00:09:03:32
不明
Again? I thought the the presentation, the keynote this morning was very interesting about how we can increase the velocity of that supply chain and bring that into it. Then from an analytics perspective, you know, we we know already and this has been around for quite some time from analytics side of things, AI is really good at finding consistencies, finding trends that we as humans just wouldn't pick up on.

00:09:03:45 - 00:09:40:14
不明
And by putting that that global ecosystem in place, we can find global trends that maybe somebody in, in China wouldn't necessarily notice in for somebody in the US, we wouldn't be looking at that globally. So it's all about putting those foundations in first and then leveraging AI to increase that velocity. And across AB. Fantastic. Thanks, Tom. Just for the idea from from your perspective, as you have visibility across the market, across industries, what are innovative use cases are you seeing with with generative AI that, you know, you could share with audience today?

00:09:40:19 - 00:10:14:29
不明
Yeah. So, I think, now as we all, it's more about, not working in silos and it's all about, the connected experiences that we can provide to our customers. So we see a lot of, general use cases which are coming in, first. And of course, in starting from the engineering side of it, where we are dramatically able to increase our productivity, by, in the entire development cycle, we are able to bring in, our accelerators and tools, which helps us speed, things which will definitely, speed up things and reduce the costs.

00:10:14:29 - 00:10:38:03
不明
That's one part of it. And of course, in terms of weather, in terms of, the chat bots, which are doing or rather bringing an edge into AI and in marketing, there are a lot of multiple use cases which are plugged in, and it's not just in one sector, whether it is in manufacturing, in healthcare, or in financial services, a wide range of use cases we are being able to, see right now and some of the tools are already being implemented today.

00:10:38:07 - 00:11:05:28
不明
Fantastic. Thanks for that. And Claudia, we're having a discussion on this, yesterday evening. When could you show share some of the methods, tools and some of the approaches that you're adopting at AT&T? Yeah. When we talk about gen AI and content creation, you can look at this at different ways, right? It's not just about your Firefly and creating images, but it's also about what are those smaller or features that can help you with productivity.

00:11:05:33 - 00:11:33:01
不明
At AT&T, we started using a couple of, features that are embedded within Photoshop that are actually Firefly, tools to start, like working on the backgrounds or adding or removing elements from a photograph. And just by using those simple features, we have achieved 15% year over year, increasing output without extending our headcount, which is like really impressive.

00:11:33:01 - 00:11:58:26
不明
And this is something that was already there, right? So also when we talk about AI and content, it's not only about the creation, but also think about how it can enhance your workflow efficiencies and how you start becoming more, product with looking you saw today in the morning like work front, right, how we have at AT&T being able to use work front.

00:11:58:37 - 00:12:25:51
不明
And what are all those capable leads that they keep coming with and how you integrate it with your different other tools. And you start creating and unlocking opportunities of efficiency. It's not just about creating content, but it's how everything comes together with your workflow. Fantastic. And, Claudia, just to continue on that, how are you linking the creative process into the personalization realm of the content delivery?

00:12:25:51 - 00:12:47:56
不明
And then aligning that or assigning that to different segments and personas? Great question. Because as we start seeing and you heard this morning like it's all about personalization, right? So the demands of content are going to continue to increase. And I don't know what's how is in in your industries, but I don't know, like if the headcount will also increase.

00:12:47:56 - 00:13:19:52
不明
Right. So how do we become more productive. So and personalization right. It is going to continue to grow with AT&T. We started our personalization journey a few years ago, and so far we have seen 38% increase in conversion by using personalized content. Now, where the opportunity lies is that we keep thinking about personalization on the leading unlocking space, but we have not yet the opportunities with the personalization on the buying state.

00:13:19:57 - 00:13:55:07
不明
So also in the morning in the keynote, the SVP of Lele was talking about the opportunities of unlocking that personalization and across the entire funnel. So that is a journey that we are on at AT&T and looking for us to how we're going to really unlock those possibilities. Fantastic. And I think the other thing that we talked about previously is the importance of experimenting with this, not just saying, you know, the the days of our we're going to invest millions and millions on something because we think that the business case is going to play out.

00:13:55:12 - 00:14:14:49
不明
That's not how we're doing it. AB certainly from what you said at AT&T, that is the way that you all go going. Either it's try things, you know, the the term that I don't particularly like, which is fail fast but learn fast actually what works well and then iterate from that. And again, that was called out in the keynote this morning, which really resonates with me.

00:14:14:49 - 00:14:48:32
不明
But you don't need to have, you know, a huge framework to be able to experiment with this stuff. As long as you've got the guidelines across the across the business and it's AB when it comes to it. I, I think, you know, we were very quick actually looking at how we can make sure we can leverage this, but leveraging it in a, in a safe way, in a compliant way, in a legal way, so that then our business feel comfortable with trying things out with with AI, but making sure that we're keeping ourselves safe.

00:14:48:32 - 00:15:11:07
不明
And we can talk about that more further. But, you know, try these things out if it works, great, if you can do it for a relatively low cost, if it doesn't work, your loss is quite low as well. Oh, sorry. Go on. Sorry. You bring an excellent point about AB testing. Well, I have a an example of how the things that we do, digitally on atw.com.

00:15:11:07 - 00:15:42:27
不明
Right. We let data drive our decisions and, the homepage is a very impactful real estate. And there's a lot of priorities that we need to prioritize within that one page in everybody in the business have their priorities. And there's like five different things that we need to position above the fold, which is really hard to do. So we turning to AB and run test and we merge with technology and AI and we use machine learning.

00:15:42:41 - 00:16:07:21
不明
So it's like does machine learning perform better than human dictated content. Me saying this audience, this should see creative A versus creative B, or it should I let the algorithm dictate what the customer should see. And by doing an AB test, we have a data prove us like you should let the machine learn that, machine learning drive the content.

00:16:07:26 - 00:16:35:45
不明
And since we've done that, our performance for click through rate and conversion from our homepage have gone up. And we don't have to have multiple discussions a week of what are the priorities. That's a fantastic example. And, you know, while we are in personalization, we discussed a B testing time. It'd be interesting for you to share how your tackling personalization through search as a different means to deliver more predictability on on outcomes.

00:16:36:00 - 00:16:57:07
不明
So well, talking about just wanting to go back to the a B testing, we're very again very much in our infancy with that at AB. But the way that we are approaching it and this people in this room from AB that I've been involved in, this is basically marrying up two sides of the customer. The sort of set up.

00:16:57:07 - 00:17:19:10
不明
And one is we actually go out and talk to our customers, you know, we serve our customers. We do, you know, across our divisions and talk to them, find out what is it that you liking about engaging with us? What is it that you're liking? Whether it's from a digital side of things, what isn't going so well and you know, almost a bit of friendly fire with that, but then also matching that up with analytics.

00:17:19:10 - 00:17:34:40
不明
And when I said about this being in our infancy, we're only just starting to do that. The reason why we're doing that is because a customer may say, I want it to work like this, and I and I want to, you know, work with you in this way. But the analytics may so it may say something completely different.

00:17:34:40 - 00:18:02:22
不明
So we need to have that conversation. But to understand both sides and be able to start looking at next steps with that. Because they may be saying that but their behavior is showing something different. So what do we need to be changing? Do we need to be having a different conversation with our customers? Do we need to be presenting it to them in a different way through our digital channels, or is it actually, you know, we just need to go with the analytics, but you all should be marrying those two up from a search side of things.

00:18:02:33 - 00:18:26:56
不明
Again, this is something that we've taken quite big advances in over the last. Was it six months since have brought in some dedicated search results for for AB, 89% of our customers on our site search for products. So they're looking for product information. Now that's saying, you know, both positives and negatives that they're looking to get straight to the products, finding the product information that they need, find the support that they need.

00:18:27:09 - 00:18:49:48
不明
But also, you know, a large proportion of our business is through industries. You know, we've got depending on who you ask, we've got 23 to 26 industries that we create content in and work through, as a, as a business. So why aren't we driving more content through our industry streams and driving that personalization through through there. And that isn't reflected through search at the moment.

00:18:49:48 - 00:19:09:34
不明
But that's where where we're going with it. Fantastic. And so, as part of your search roadmap, we we've had a discussion on another conversational AI element that's that we're looking to add on to your roadmap. Do you want to describe to the audience, you know, what advances you're looking to make there and the matching of search outcomes?

00:19:09:39 - 00:19:34:48
不明
It's it's quite cool actually. We haven't launched it yet, so I don't really want to talk about it too much. But is where, you know, we're using AI to drive the more conversational, search with our customers. But the things that we've been experimenting with this is, as we know, Jen, AI certainly in the search space can hallucinate, can give off results to to customers.

00:19:34:48 - 00:20:02:20
不明
So it's how do we balance that up with traditional search results, making sure that they're prioritizing the right way for our customers, but also through a conversational side of things as well. The other benefit that we're seeing from from that already is the the language barrier there. Again, that you saw some of that this morning, but not necessarily in search, is being able to provide search results in the customer's native language, which may have come from, you know, a different language to what they're searching in.

00:20:02:20 - 00:20:26:22
不明
So search in Italian. And the results are actually in English, but they get the results in in their native language, which is is pretty cool. Yeah. It's a lot more to come on that and Buendia from, you know, from your goal lens or aperture at the market. We've discussed AB testing for personalization and discussed content aligning it to different journeys industries.

00:20:26:27 - 00:20:45:04
不明
And then we've extended on search what what are the areas of personal in the realms of personalization? Can you share with the audience that are picking up a lot of traction but also driving meaningful outcomes? Yeah, I think with, definitely with the generative AI coming in retrieval, augmented search is something which we are seeing a lot of traction.

00:20:45:09 - 00:21:10:04
不明
And as I mentioned earlier, there is there is also the issue of hallucination and ensuring that the data is, intact and the right search output is provided. But there is a lot of scope there, and it is definitely moving to the next level, with the kind of features that are it is bringing in. So, we are seeing a host of opportunities where it's all about bringing, as I mentioned earlier, hyper personalization and scaling.

00:21:10:17 - 00:21:33:04
不明
The customer demands it, wants it, and definitely asks for all the data which is available, to be, you know, 360 degree format for them. And that's exactly what the new search techniques and are, is providing today. So that some of the that is one main thing, which we are definitely seeing in the search area. Fantastic. Keeping in with the theme of of personalization, I promise I'll go beyond this in a moment.

00:21:33:09 - 00:22:01:01
不明
So, Claudia, one one aspect, we were discussing, it's we start testing, doing the a b testing, we start learning. But where does that start for you? Does it start at when somebody does a search in Google, they land on your page. Where do you actually start tracking and identifying your your leads to start driving the personalization. So it should be in first customer touchpoint right?

00:22:01:01 - 00:22:34:52
不明
Is again, going back to that seamless omnichannel customer journey is understanding what cohort is interacting with your content and then driving that same cohort across the different channels. So we're like looking at AT&T, the usage of CDP to help us with connecting all of those different channels. Again, it's it's a journey for us. There's so much more for us to, to uncover and perfect.

00:22:34:57 - 00:22:57:05
不明
I feel like we are, even though we've been in the personalization journey for a few years now, is still feels relatively young. And, all of the different tools and technology that keep coming into the market are really going to help and support that. Right? And also, the customers keep evolving us to where do they want to shop?

00:22:57:05 - 00:23:23:13
不明
What is the kind of information that they want to receive? Not every single customer wants the same amount of information. So how can you personalize that? It's not just about the messaging, but it's about the amount of messaging. Also the journeys. Does this customer want to go through a flow that has 20 steps? Or these customer is savvy enough that they just want a bundle customized already for them.

00:23:23:18 - 00:23:47:08
不明
So in that personalization aspect, there's different different areas, that can be uncovered. So as you're describing, you know, some of the challenges as well, you seeing personalization that at an early stage, could you describe some of the challenges that you've you've picked up along your journey and you know, how do you tackle them and turn them into opportunities for yourself?

00:23:47:13 - 00:24:25:00
不明
Yeah. I think the challenges become with being such a big company with so many different products and the achieving omnichannel can be a hard part, right? Big company. But how do we uncover these opportunities and how you become that person that is able to champion change and be able to speak up and say this is what we usually should be doing for the customer.

00:24:25:04 - 00:25:04:24
不明
So it may take time, but sometimes repetition is what will get you to success. So for us is understanding what the problem is, but also the same time trying to start with a small, use case. Right? So if I can show you in the domain that I can that I control, which is at dot com, if I'm able to to come with a use case that shows you that by personalizing the content on the homepage and carrying that message all the way through the buy flow, if I can increase click through rate or progression, that is a win.

00:25:04:31 - 00:25:24:56
不明
And now I can take that to my peers on other channels and say, hey, I did this. What about if you help me and let's do these cohesive message from your paid campaign into the website and let's see how that goes. Right? So we pick a use case. We see that that conversion, the plethora and the conversion are lifted.

00:25:25:01 - 00:25:54:46
不明
Now I can start evangelizing this with data that will support that. This is what we should be doing. Yeah. And that really resonates with with me. And my experience at Airbnb is that again, starting small, showing an example and something that one of my colleagues at Abbey B says so many times seeing is believing with this stuff. So we can go into into board meetings, we can go into committees, we can go into steering committees and so on and talk and evangelize about this stuff.

00:25:54:55 - 00:26:14:09
不明
But it's still this start actually seeing, you know, the output, seeing how this would work. Then they don't stop me. And then they can stop buying into this. And I think, again, going with with divisions, you know, ab very different divisions, very different go to markets, as I mentioned earlier, trying out with with one of those seeing what works.

00:26:14:09 - 00:26:35:38
不明
And then that could potentially work for, for other divisions. The other thing that, I've learned in my time, not just to AB, but in general, one size doesn't fit all with this stuff. So just trying to go blank it. Well, we're all going to do this approach to personalization doesn't necessarily work. And you know it's trying to find the commonalities with divisions.

00:26:35:47 - 00:26:56:03
不明
And then they can distinct find themselves in those areas if that's even a word. Thank you Tom. Thanks, Claudia and Benji, if, if you could share with the audience today when when everyone's faced challenge, I think we could. It's fair to say we've since the beginning of humanity, we've been transforming, and we're just at a different pace of it today.

00:26:56:07 - 00:27:30:50
不明
Where do you see the biggest challenges that you're converting to? Opportunities. Yeah. So, I think whenever we convert from a legacy system to the new age martech system, sometimes that is the issue of having data going into silos, and then we convert them to an opportunity by giving the customer a 360 degree view of the data and then, ensuring that this is utilized to get, hyper personalization, which, which is really taking advantage of the challenge that we have and converting it to an opportunity, which we definitely see coming in many circumstances.

00:27:30:50 - 00:27:57:33
不明
And it's also about, for any problem that we see now, it's it's all about going with the mindset that you have to go with the composable architecture and have an AI for strategy, which definitely helps us. Transform any challenge into opportunity. Fantastic. And what are the efficiency plays that you use seeing, you know, when you're trying to convert, you know, the topics you've discussed into challenges to opportunities.

00:27:57:37 - 00:28:28:03
不明
What is the efficiency levers that you see, that customers are adopting and how are they unlocking the value through that efficiency? And what are the areas you see the investments heading towards? Yeah. So, some of the yeah. Definitely. There is a lot of, an analysis which goes into it in terms of, when we, try to do this for the customer, we do analysis and understand we do a lot of analytics around it and also around sentiment analysis and a lot of that we do so that we give the right amount of data.

00:28:28:08 - 00:28:50:15
不明
And also the customers. Definitely. Now even the, the, the click through rates or even the page time on the page, and a lot of other factors are there which, which are being tracked at the minuteness level now so that, there is no loss in the data, as you said, it's all about now, the journey and and several orchestrating the, journey for the customer end to end.

00:28:50:20 - 00:29:14:44
不明
And, a lot of these metrics are definitely tracked and, followed through so that there is no loss of data while waiting things. Fantastic. So I just wanted to lead on to another question. So we've talked about addressing strategy, addressing foundational elements. What about adoption? So from from your perspective, you know, AT&T comms is a massive estate.

00:29:14:49 - 00:29:46:57
不明
You've got a lot of different and, product owners, you've got a lot of different entities. How do you help adopt to the tech and data advancements you're making and communication, content and personalization? It's not an easy task. I said said before, you need to really become an agent of change and be willing to lead that for the rest of the organization, especially in times like now that we keep seeing the advancements of AI.

00:29:47:02 - 00:30:23:47
不明
How do you turn a company that is set in certain ways and the processes do not exist to bring that new technology? So if you're passionate about it, which I hope you are, because this is the future, is how you build that path and find a way to convince your manager, then your manager, to convince their manager and start building these relationships and start creating a process to bring everybody along into these new journey we're in, really in an era of revolution and is not going to stop.

00:30:23:58 - 00:30:57:03
不明
Oh, absolutely. And also another adoption tactic is internal talent. You know, how, are people geared to adopt this technology and take it forward and, and essentially reassign tasks of their daily jobs to the new tech that you bring in some from, from your your perspective in a, in a decent environment, in a decentralized business like AB, it's in my view, and the way that that I'm moving forward with this, it's all about the pull from the business.

00:30:57:14 - 00:31:18:25
不明
So when I talk about a lot, is if you're trying to force something onto onto individuals are for something onto a department, then you're automatically going to get, you know, push back for that. Anybody that's got kids will know about if you start trying to force them to eat the green greens at dinner, you know, it's going to end up on the wall at some point.

00:31:18:36 - 00:31:38:43
不明
At least it did for me. But, it's about how do you get them enthusiastic in it. And the way that we're approaching our transformation is very, very much about what are the challenges, what are the opportunities that you want to overcome or achieve across across your division? And then how do we build that capability to enable you to do that?

00:31:38:43 - 00:31:58:12
不明
Now, of course, we do guide them with with some of that to make sure that the releases that we're delivering, the capability that we're delivering is, is going to enable them to optimize. But fundamentally, it's about the pull pull from the business. You get that in place, then you know you're pushing against an open door. They're wanting to take this capability, from you.

00:31:58:12 - 00:32:25:21
不明
So always keep that in mind. And then I'd love to hear your perspectives on when when you'd be delivering more advancements in technology, which is driving a lot of efficiency to unlock value. What are you seeing the the opportunities for organizations in in talent and reskilling to really benefit from the promise of, AI or gen AI into their organizations?

00:32:25:26 - 00:32:46:03
不明
Yeah. So, as an organization, we are really focused on bringing AI first culture in our work, workplace and workforce, which means that we we use AI to transform the way we do our day to day activities in work, whether it's on the engineering side or on the to day applications that the team uses, as well as how you deliver to the client.

00:32:46:03 - 00:33:04:30
不明
So it's really, it's not whether you want to adopt AI today in our organization and emphasis, it's more about, you know, how how well you can do it. So it's all about changing the culture of the organization to adopt to it in, in the complete way that we are doing it. And we have done that in a significant way.

00:33:04:35 - 00:33:35:01
不明
Second is all second is about getting the team trained. So, we have ensured that, we have come completely trained and made our folks AI aware and then moving people to different levels of certification. So that, you know, technology, it is ingrained into them and built different accelerators which can enhance their productivity and, and the realization for the people that it is, not to replace them, but to actually bring them to a level which will, make them in par with the the person with the better experience and simplify their lives.

00:33:35:06 - 00:33:52:19
不明
So that is gone into the people. And I think it's all about the culture that you bring in. So that is the most important third is of course, the, I believe we need to have a responsible AI guideline and framework. And that should be in place to ensure that everything is within the checks and balances that needs to be there.

00:33:52:24 - 00:34:22:31
不明
So, Tom, I want to to refocus on, you know, you're speaking about pull from the business. Now we see that, you know, when we are driving long term transformations that are being delivered over multiple releases as the business starts to learn, adapt to tech advancements. There's something called AI out there, you know, how do you balance, you know, releasing the baseline capability while adopting, the demand from the business.

00:34:22:31 - 00:34:49:17
不明
And and I remember you discussing this as it's about distinct and about being caught. Yeah. Could you get into that a little bit for us I think so. So the there's two in the transformation that we're going through. There's fundamentally two streams. There's the build of the capability, which is all driven by the business prioritized by the business, so that then they're getting regular drops of capability on a on a monthly basis so that there's new stuff coming through.

00:34:49:31 - 00:35:09:22
不明
And the priorities of those, as I say it very much set by the business. Now then the second part is around the adoption, making sure that they've got the right skill sets, got the right resources to be able to adopt that, that capability. And there's reason why I call it adoption, not migration, because migration is just moving from one place to another.

00:35:09:26 - 00:35:32:45
不明
Adoption is about changing the way that they're actually going to be working, changing the the tools that they're going to be using and changing the ways that they're going to be interacting with their customers and really putting the customer at the forefront of everything that that they're doing. Now, what we're finding and what we predicted as a result of the adoption piece is they're starting to learn, there's all this new stuff that I can use.

00:35:32:45 - 00:35:51:52
不明
There's this new capability, but now I want more. Remember what I said about the pull? I'm wanting more of this. This is, you know, these are the types of tools that we're wanting that are distinct to our business. And what we're we're spinning up as part of the transformation is now what I foresee going into there are more businesses as usual.

00:35:51:52 - 00:36:11:15
不明
So a factory model where we're iteratively the third stream of iteratively continuously improving and the capacity of that, again, because they're the ones that paying the bill is down to the divisions. So if they want this capability to be able to be rolled out more rapidly than we increase the capacity, increase the cost, that goes with that. Unfortunately.

00:36:11:20 - 00:36:31:30
不明
Well, maybe you could help me with that. You know, increase the cost of that so that then we can roll it out quicker if we're having tougher years or if they're wanting to slow down, they're not able to take that change on. We can ramp that capability down. So program through releases, division adoption within the divisions and then moving into the third stream, which is continuous improvement.

00:36:31:35 - 00:36:59:30
不明
Thanks. Sam and Bonnie have we could if you could share with the audience some insights on, you know, some of our large customers who are on a multiyear transformation. You know, they they they see opportunity to drive disruption to their own transformations, through the use of AI engineer. How do you how would you safely integrate these capabilities mid transformation?

00:36:59:34 - 00:37:38:13
不明
How do you see. So sorry to be last. So how do you balance integrating new capabilities halfway through transformation. Yeah. So I think there are a couple of, customers. Of course we have long running transformation journeys and of course is one and, definitely, we kind of break it into parts and we ensure that, we have, we do have a continuous we, we kind of do something known as a studio model, brainstorming with them where we ensure that, a whole set of ideas are, completely worked through.

00:37:38:18 - 00:38:05:51
不明
And we, we also ensure that, the, the existing data, the existing functions, which are there are totally utilized and, and that kind of baseline for us to integrate into it, integrate into the newer capabilities and the new offerings. So it's a continuously evolving process. And whenever new offerings are defined, we keep in mind the existing, the opportunities which are there and kind of binded and tied together into it so that we can take it forward.

00:38:05:56 - 00:38:33:58
不明
So that's the process. And of course, studio model is another big thing that we are working on, and that will definitely ensure that the, the whole process moves into the, the future augmented. Yeah. Fantastic. Just doing a quick time check. We've got 20 minutes and we all plan for roughly 15 minutes of Q&A, with, with the audience, just to make it more interactive, address some questions you may have we may not have addressed or would like to address.

00:38:34:03 - 00:39:04:32
不明
So just like to we got the microphone in the middle. Just wanted to see if there's any hands up any questions up. Our panelists today. Go ahead. What do you think is the main difference between the A, B to C and A 35? The others. Well I'd stop. Yeah okay. So in my opinion B to C and and b to B it's, you know.

00:39:04:37 - 00:39:41:15
不明
There's not that much difference. There's just more complexity in the B to B side of things. Let's be honest there. I think over the last few years, few decades, the B2B side of things has become more focused on customer. And I think that's absolutely the right way to go. But what they're, they're, we're learning from that is, yes, we're more focused on customer, but there's more barriers that we need to be getting over as a as a business in the B2B space because the, you know, credit checks, there's, you know, there's more than one person from that business that are buying from us.

00:39:41:15 - 00:40:12:19
不明
So how do we deal with that? There's the whole documentation side of things, more complex products and so on. So I think it's the level of complexity, but still fundamentally we've got business buyers that are comparing their experience to towards Airbnb to, well, it's so easy for me to do this through Amazon. Why is this so complicated to do this through you as a, as a company, not AB because we're awesome, but it's but there is that comparison.

00:40:12:19 - 00:40:35:58
不明
If I, if I can do this this easily in my personal life, then I expect the same thing from A from a B to B side of things. So I think the fundamental in a word is the complexity. Morris. That's that's what it's down to for AT&T, I think is, is the between consumer and listeners is the amount of people that you need to serve.

00:40:36:00 - 00:41:02:40
不明
Right. So the product and the quality should be the same. But because you're not serving a family of four or you're serving a business of 2050 plus, what is that offering? There's still competitive. From a experience perspective. There should not be difference as to as an individual. How are you purchasing these products digitally or in a retail space and business?

00:41:02:40 - 00:41:32:57
不明
You should have the seamless experience as well. But from a product offering is very different. Yeah. And another thing, just that I've thought about from a B2B side of things, the the trends in B2B buying, you know, interestingly enough, from a procurement perspective, the procurement group, not the procurement team, the procurement group is growing. So you would you know, I would have thought until I saw these stats that the procurement groups would be getting smaller because you'd be able to move quicker.

00:41:33:01 - 00:42:01:35
不明
Actually, they're getting bigger. And that's because of, you know, the generational changes where we've got, you know, buyers that are coming through that are not used to the traditional ways of, of sales and going to the salespeople and so many turning up at their the factory door to talk about about things and so on. No, they want to do the vast majority of that research online and only really get in touch with the company that's selling at the the last few stages.

00:42:01:35 - 00:42:19:19
不明
And I think the the stats were that the buying groups were around between 4 and 6. They're now predicted to be more around, you know, 10 to 12. And that's because more people within the business that is buying want to have an input in. Well, I want it to be like this, and I need it like that and it needs to be compliant.

00:42:19:19 - 00:42:42:47
不明
It needs to be, you know, in sustainability considerations and, and all the regulatory side of things. And they're wanting to give inputs. So it's a group thing and not necessarily working well as a team. And that's another challenge from B2B and another point around this and you'll see how things come together is you ask what's the difference between consumer and business.

00:42:42:52 - 00:43:11:12
不明
But in AT&T there's lots of instances where a consumer owns a business. Yeah. So and when we talk about personalization, when that person comes to an outcome, what content should I be showing him? Should I be cross-selling him. Does he have two accounts that he has his personal accounts, his business account? Does he go to business.com, like all of those nuances are so interesting and opens a lot of opportunity.

00:43:11:16 - 00:43:35:49
不明
Yeah, especially for this audience. They require very different value propositions, from an individual from A, B to C with quicker, faster buying decisions. No one has to look over the shoulder to ask or confer. On the B2B sides, Tom's points, you've got six to 10 to 12 buyers who are looking for different things. So really, really interesting.

00:43:35:54 - 00:43:47:01
不明
Any any other questions from anybody. Hopefully that that answers your question. Any hands up.

00:43:47:06 - 00:44:20:51
不明
No. Anyone. Oh, sorry. Go ahead please. I was just curious. Like, what are what are the conversations you have? The creators, the creative teams, the research, sell them into it or insight into it. What's the best that I have to stay with it? Your. Is that. So there is an excitement there because you have identified an opportunity in an area that is very tedious, right?

00:44:20:58 - 00:44:51:02
不明
You spend hours removing a background when instead you can be creating beautiful art. Right? So now with a touch of a button, within seconds that background is gone. I'm not spending my time there. I'm spending my time doing actually creating stuff. So it is very exciting for them. And it's like it's how you talk to them about things and how you let them be on the driving seat.

00:44:51:07 - 00:45:06:54
不明
And I think that, I've never I've not met a creative team, you know, our marketing team that have been sat there waiting, going, well, I've got nothing to do. It's all right. I've got loads of time to be able to do this, this thing that you're asking me to do. It's always within the stack of things.

00:45:06:54 - 00:45:28:14
不明
So if we can, you know, free up time and make them, you know, make them availability for the more interesting stuff, the creative side of things, then, you know, more for it. I think in the experience that we've had at AB, certainly just in the AI and gen AI over the last year, it's been getting over the fear.

00:45:28:19 - 00:45:49:14
不明
You know, there's this, as we've all seen in the press, this, you know, the this AI is going to take our jobs, it's judgment Day, all of that sort of thing. And and moving on from well, actually, this is the seeing is believing this can actually make our lives a lot better. It's more of a, you know, stealing Microsoft term, more of a copilot.

00:45:49:19 - 00:46:13:43
不明
Get rid of the tedious stuff that you said, Claudia. And, allow us to to do more of the creative things and move forwards that way. One thing that I heard once and I found extremely, interesting is AI is not going to replace you, is going to replace the person that doesn't know how to utilize AI. So you have to be on the driving seat.

00:46:13:48 - 00:46:49:18
不明
Fantastic. Thank you. Go ahead. I'm curious to know how this might apply to smaller organizations, specifically nonprofits like local nonprofits and public sector area schools, utilities, that kind of thing. The relevance is I'm a digital marketer, and I'm looking at positions that used to be positioned on the relations, are PR specialists and public outreach people anymore. I started to notice that all of those job descriptions really are describing, digital marketers and social media managers, that kind of thing.

00:46:49:22 - 00:46:57:07
不明
Is there a place for is it affordable for those smaller agencies to be able to do this transformation?

00:46:57:12 - 00:47:25:49
不明
Alphaville. I think there's this might be a bit contentious for the Adobe colleagues in the room. I think there's a responsibility for the large software providers to to help with nonprofits, organizations and educational organizations. And, you know, you see that through through Microsoft. I don't know what Adobe do in that space, but I think there's a bit of responsibility that to to help them in that, that sort of space.

00:47:26:00 - 00:47:47:39
不明
Because I think that there is, as with large organizations, there is a real opportunity for smaller organizations to get a bigger bang from that book without having to invest. Well, quite simply, they don't have a hundreds of thousands, millions of dollars in technology to enable them to to do that. They just don't have the money to do that.

00:47:47:43 - 00:48:18:09
不明
Whereas if there's the right sort of leveling of that software, the leveling of that capability, which I mean, I'm sure there is, then they can get get more out of it. So straight answer to your question is yes. I think there is a an opportunity within education, within, local authorities, within, nonprofit organizations to really get more out of this if they, you know, the software companies come to the table with, you know, amicable or reasonable offering, which I'm sure they will.

00:48:18:14 - 00:48:44:28
不明
No pressure. Excellent. Hopefully that's provided answer to any any further questions. Go ahead please. Oh yeah. So you were mentioning off the ag testing and using machine learning for that question. I'm curious. One, you know, which software, which is the software that you're using for the latter part. And the second part is how to get buy in from the.

00:48:44:33 - 00:48:56:04
不明
Not everyone was happy to buy into how their model I how to get that buy in to test these things. We kind of get everyone.

00:48:56:09 - 00:49:24:14
不明
Great question. Because, our partners, you know, we operated in that way of that manual segment and prioritization for many, many years. And then it's like, hey, there is this little thing called machine learning. What is that? It's like, oh, it's heaven for us. So the way that we, we have a test and learn culture in our company.

00:49:24:14 - 00:49:49:42
不明
So that is a big, big, advantage. But even with that, you need to convince your partners. So one of the tactics that we've used and continue to use when something's seems very risky is, we say we're going to test it in 10% of the traffic, 90% is going to see the manual segmentation is 10%. Let me start with 10% of the traffic.

00:49:49:42 - 00:50:15:24
不明
I'll do the 5050 split on the 10%. If it starts working. We will agree in increasing the size of the audience. And that's how we started that. And and then you have the data to support the decision and it runs really, really well. We still have to turn it off sometimes when we have, commitments with our partners.

00:50:15:24 - 00:50:38:57
不明
So let's say that we're launching, the new Samsung device, and there is a partnership on a commitment with Samsung that says they need presence on the homepage 100% of the time. Then we turn off machine learning for that period of time. But we know that it's not going to be the same performance, but it's a business use case that we need to support.

00:50:39:02 - 00:50:47:37
不明
The testing anyone? Anyone else? We've got, roughly five minutes left.

00:50:47:42 - 00:51:02:17
不明
Go ahead and. So? So, which is what things? On your.

00:51:02:22 - 00:51:37:30
不明
Page. How do you see the the crystal ball question? Good question, good question. So my my personal view not ab so disclaimer in there is I think we've got what you described. There is going to be an era of hyper personalization. I think that you know what what Claudia answered in the previous question is within large organizations, everybody's vying for the same space.

00:51:37:30 - 00:51:59:22
不明
And, you know, we're certainly seeing that, AB with some of the behaviors in the past and addressing that through through personalization so that your experience is different to, you know, our experience different. So you all get your own view and that deals with, you know, almost cannibalizing AdWords and cannibalizing, you know, each other to, to get to the top of the list.

00:51:59:33 - 00:52:23:00
不明
So there's, there's that piece and that's we know that that's happening now from a high personalization side of things. I do think there's a there's a risk. And I'm interested to it'll be interesting to see how this plays out where from an SEO side of things, you start injecting AI into that to make sure that your content is, you know, more opt, more optimized.

00:52:23:00 - 00:52:56:04
不明
If you know the SEOs there, make sure it's got the right tagging and so on. And you're not telling me that the Googles out there aren't going to start seeing that ingrained. Hang on. You using AI to to do the AI SEO is that, you know, is that rank to the right level? Should we start dismissing that and that's something that I foresee will be starting to play out over the next few years, because there's a lot of really cool tools out there, some of them from Adobe, that can deal with the SEO side of things and put a AI in that space.

00:52:56:09 - 00:53:17:13
不明
But what's the counter to that? You know, and opposites. And I think it's going to be interesting to see where the balance of you still need to have the human input for from an SEO side of things to make sure the personalization is relevant. And actually it's coming from a human is not just putting rubbish in front of them because of an algorithm.

00:53:17:18 - 00:53:43:36
不明
Yeah. How do we balance that out? And I don't know, I think that's going to be really interesting. And I also yeah, I also think it depends on your product and who your audiences are. Right. I think that you need to listen to what your customers need. We did, I'll say, a year ago for one of our, programs, we did some personalization from a messaging perspective, and we went very, very niche.

00:53:43:40 - 00:54:09:07
不明
And we crafted like five different messages for five different segments. It didn't work like we didn't see increase in click through rates or conversion. And it's like as lovely of these messages are for all of these five audiences, why am I spending my time on creating all of these variations if they're not moving the needle? So it goes back into testing and understanding.

00:54:09:12 - 00:54:29:40
不明
What is your audience really looking forward? Yeah, and I think it really comes down to what we we've all been saying about the using the AI as the copilot, but it still has to be that human element. It can, you know, deal with, you know, the monotonous work. But if you don't have the human element in there, then you're going to be missing the point, missing fundamentally the customer.

I mean, you, you can have is indicate doing it, but it's all about orchestrating it also in to ensure that the direct message, the right focus goes in as well. So yes, the future is definitely for AI to replace a lot of work that we are doing with, AI, but it's there's a, there's more to go in that.
