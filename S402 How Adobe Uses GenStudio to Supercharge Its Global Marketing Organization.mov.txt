00:00:00:05 - 00:00:25:51
不明
The last few, folks kind of trickle in. Just a big welcome to everyone. And thank you for for joining us today. Hopefully you all have had a great, first official day of summit. And, there's been a lot of great content and incredible speakers and, and we're here to, to build on that. So, so first, I'm Heather Freeland, and I'm the chief brand officer at Adobe.

00:00:25:51 - 00:00:57:27
不明
And, I'm joined onstage today by Jason Oke, who's the global client president at Dentsu. And, you know, one of the reasons we wanted to do this session today is because, Dentsu and Adobe, officially about a quarter ago, entered into a partnership, as, as one of our preferred agencies. And the origin of that partnership came from, from an agency RFP process that we ran last year but started like a week ago to like.

00:00:57:32 - 00:01:28:02
不明
Exactly. We were just we were just reminiscing about that. And, and what was really special and different about the RFP process was that, you know, we decided to to lay down the gantlet and say, that for any of our agency partners, we want them to work with us to become the best in class example and the industry leading example of how to build the ultimate content supply chain, and also how to be customer zero using Adobe's own tools.

00:01:28:02 - 00:01:53:38
不明
And so, so when we connected with the Dentsu team, we were particularly excited about the work they had already been doing. With our tools, with other clients around the world, and what we could continue to to raise the bar for ourselves on, but then also what we could build together heading into the future. Absolutely. So, so we are excited to kind of walk you through that, that journey that we've been on and how we've been looking at it.

00:01:53:43 - 00:02:09:27
不明
But we also want to make sure this is an interactive session. I know there's a lot of questions going on to, so we'll speak for a little bit, but we really have carved out a lot of time for Q&A. So, so be sure to, to, tee them up in your mind as we go through the session.

00:02:09:32 - 00:02:53:39
不明
So, you know, I've, I've talked about a little bit the relationship that we're on and and one of the really special things about the, the journey is we are looking to really build a global ecosystem for the development of content and not only do we want that to be powered by, by Adobe's Gen Studio, but we really want to bring in all of the incredible new generative AI tools as well, and see ourselves as, as the what we refer to internally as customer zero, which is how do we both use the tools but also influence what, our product team's on what is built.

00:02:53:44 - 00:03:16:13
不明
And this becomes that much more important because, like many of you in the room, I'm sure we are dealing with the massive explosion and the demands for content. And, you know, you see it every day, but there's constantly the need for not just more channels, but we have more products for marketing, more languages, more formats.

00:03:16:13 - 00:03:40:08
不明
And of course, the demand for personalized fashion. So, so the content ecosystem has become not just that much more complex, but, but the demands for more content have grown exponentially. And as I'm sure many of you all can identify with the resources, both funding and people does not grow at the same rate as the demands for content.

00:03:40:20 - 00:04:03:48
不明
So it's incumbent upon us to, to really figure out how to make the most of these tools and products to really help, help accelerate that. So I'd love to hear maybe a little bit more from you, Jason, about what you're seeing. I mean, I know we're embarking on this journey together, but, but I'd love to hear your observations on what you're seeing across clients at Dentsu.

00:04:03:59 - 00:04:27:07
不明
Yeah, for sure. And I think, you know, listening to the conversations over the last day, I think we're all facing some version of this. But I think we're seeing this kind of four interlinked factors behind all of this. One is I think we're all dealing with a fragmented media ecosystem. Right. More and more channels. Just looking at my, my streaming bills every month, I think is one example of that, hundreds and hundreds of channels.

00:04:27:12 - 00:04:46:23
不明
The second thing is, you know, more and more customer segmentation, right? And I think now we're often dealing with dozens of customer segments because we have the increasing ability with first party data, to, to have, you know, really sophisticated audience strategies. But that just means you need more and more content to be able to speak to each one of those audiences and drive the right level of engagement.

00:04:46:28 - 00:05:04:13
不明
You know, the third thing is there's a demand for constantly refreshed content, right? Content gets stale really quickly, and especially with things like seasonality or trying to keep up with social media trends, news cycles, all those things that churn incredibly quickly. I think there's just a demand that we all have to be creating more and more content week by week.

00:05:04:18 - 00:05:25:06
不明
So as you can see, you know, on this slide with a relatively small number of variables, really quickly, you get to hundreds of thousands of assets, which is just impossible to do manually. Right? You have to have an almost an infinitely large team in order to crank out that many assets. And as Heather just said, none of us had an infinite budget.

00:05:25:11 - 00:05:48:38
不明
The fourth thing, though, is, you know, in an increasingly competitive environment, I think there's just a demand. Our products are launching faster and faster, right? Whether you're in the software industry, hardware industries like, like, you know, phones and computers, food and beverage, you know, trying to, launch new flavors, all the time, deals and offers, right, to respond to changing market conditions.

00:05:48:43 - 00:06:05:35
不明
I think we're all in the situation of just having to create more and more content to keep up with the demands of the business. And, you know, Adobe is a great example of this, Heather, because like you guys over the last couple of years went from launching products maybe a couple of times a year to launching new releases almost every week or even more than once a week.

00:06:05:35 - 00:06:34:05
不明
Absolutely. It is, the bags under my eyes probably, reveal that, but yes, it's the the pace of innovation, particularly in the, the technology world has just grown exponentially. And and it really is, mind boggling how fast that's coming. And, and again, the increasing pressures it puts upon us to, to increase the amount of content and, and diversity and how we're going to market.

00:06:34:10 - 00:06:57:12
不明
And, you know, it's so interesting for us is, you know, for a long time we, we kind of had this very linear creative process and, and what we see really is now a bit more of what I like to refer to as the spaghetti mass. I see a lot of people taking photos. This probably feels very familiar and maybe cathartic to know that you're not in this alone.

00:06:57:13 - 00:07:25:16
不明
We all suffer, from from this spaghetti mess. Because as we have infinite reviewers and approvers and channel owners and what have you, it just gets more and more complicated. But it's also more and more difficult to keep track of it all. And, you know, with the volume of content we're producing and the needs for personalization, we really need that, a system to help keep track of it.

00:07:25:16 - 00:07:59:24
不明
And, and also not just keep track of it, but help us drive continuous improvement to understand our own content operations and our own metrics of how we are performing as a marketing team in terms of how we're we're producing. And so we've made a big shift over the last couple of years and investing much more in not just kind of standardizing our workflows and implementing new tools, but putting a greater, level of importance on operations and program management to help make sure that we are, flowing everything's the system as efficiently as possible.

00:07:59:24 - 00:08:31:16
不明
And, and again, getting away from from that spaghetti spaghetti mess. There's still some spaghetti. Yeah. There's still some spaghetti. Yes. He is, our agency. So he knows our spaghetti. So, it's just spaghetti. Yes, exactly. So the the risk of not addressing this, though, is very real, because if you continue to have this complexity and you're not getting it under control, as things continue to get even more complex, it will get even, even messier.

00:08:31:20 - 00:08:55:32
不明
So I think what we, we need to do is and what the journey that we've been going on since we joined forces has really been to say, okay, how do we how do we get started in wrangling this and streamlining how we work together? So, so maybe take a step back, Jason, as you guys have embarked on this with us, how did you think about getting started?

00:08:55:37 - 00:09:15:22
不明
Well, you know, I mean, first just to to build on what you just said, right? Working that way with that spaghetti mass is not just time consuming. It's expensive. Right? It results in poor quality work. It results in teams being burned out and stretched to the max, and ultimately resulting in a poor customer experience. Right. And and none of us want that.

00:09:15:34 - 00:09:32:32
不明
So this is a very real problem that we need to address and we need to fix, for all of those things to, to be more sustainable. And, you know, when we first started working together, you know, we did a bit of an audit and discovery of how you were working and, and noticed things like, you know, content sitting in lots of different places.

00:09:32:32 - 00:09:52:31
不明
Right. So some things on SharePoint drives and drop boxes in an Am assets, in Figma, sitting on a, somebody's desktop, you know, on their computer, on a hard drive under somebody's desk or on a thumb drive somewhere. Right. You have content all over the place. And so you have no visibility really into sort of, you know, what even is the problem that you need to solve.

00:09:52:31 - 00:10:06:49
不明
So one of the first things that we had to do was to do a content audit, if you're going to operate with this kind of volume and this kind of velocity, you need to at least know what your starting point is. And you need to have one seamless view across everything. You know, it's not just us as an agency.

00:10:06:49 - 00:10:28:52
不明
Adobe also has an in-house studio. There's other agencies in the, the, the I.T mix, media agencies and, and other other creative agencies. And so, you know, we had to sort of step back and sort of diagnose what the problem was to begin with. Right? In order to get to that single unified view. So the very first thing you have to do is just to do an audit, right?

00:10:28:52 - 00:10:46:22
不明
Like how much are you actually dealing with? And you guys did a huge amount of work to actually give us very, very long, detailed spreadsheets about all the hundreds of thousands of assets that were being made all over the world. And so that was the kind of starting point, and, you know, it's not just counting the assets.

00:10:46:22 - 00:11:04:14
不明
It's also looking at what's your taxonomy, you know, what's your metadata look like? How are your assets actually being, being tracked all over the world. And so that was kind of the first stage to really just gauge the organization readiness between our two organizations about what's the problem and kind of how ready are we to to deal with this?

00:11:04:19 - 00:11:25:11
不明
So that kind of sets you up for success, right? The next thing was, we had to do, a real change management sort of exercise to, to sort of understand, like, how do we change together, right? Do we who do we have to bring along for this journey? Different departments within Adobe, making sure all the agencies are all kind of marching together.

00:11:25:16 - 00:11:45:33
不明
And so don't underestimate the change management that's required. Right? This isn't just buying a new piece of software. It really is changing the way that you do content. In the end, it's a transformation transforming the internal processes and the entire agency ecosystem. And you need to have a plan to, to what do you actually going to do with generative AI.

00:11:45:33 - 00:12:11:43
不明
Right. That's a huge part of this. And it's a huge unlock. But you also have to know what you're getting yourself into, right? You know, are you doing this to let your creatives, focus on higher value tasks by removing some of the mundane day to day things? You know, Firefly is great at that. Or you've seen some of the presentations today, you know, automating and, allowing you to do some of the day to day creative tasks really, really quickly so that your creatives can focus on more strategic things.

00:12:11:50 - 00:12:33:31
不明
Concepting. Ideating. But also just automating things like pulling metadata through writing content, tagging, bringing the data directly from your briefs into the platforms and into the deployment, frees up a lot of time for the teams to, to work on other things. So there's a lot of questions that we had to sort of ask going into this about what we wanted to get out of it.

00:12:33:35 - 00:13:05:09
不明
And that all ties into measurement and optimization as well. Right. You know what? You tag is what you can measure. So we had to think really clearly about, you know, what? What are we actually tagging? What does that metadata look like so that we can then track the right performance and efficiency KPIs. And it was really clear that, you know, they wanted to see certain efficiencies and certain productivity gains, not just for their own benefit, but also to be able to sort of tell that customer zero story that Heather talked about, to other companies, about the benefits that could be realized from this.

00:13:05:14 - 00:13:34:43
不明
So there's a lot of pressure on us as a sort of joint ecosystem to document what we were doing and make sure, that we were really clear on the benefits we were seeing. Yeah. So, yeah. And it is funny because I think, the when we embarked on this partnership, we saw this as much, as, an opportunity for us to change internally to it was not just asking, Dentsu to come in.

00:13:34:43 - 00:13:57:02
不明
It was like how can we raise the bar for how we operate overall? So it was definitely a lot of, of change management for sure. For sure. And I, you know, it is interesting to, I think the, the notion of what we're trying to do and what we're trying to accomplish together is not new, right?

00:13:57:03 - 00:14:17:29
不明
It's not and the need and how we build content together has not changed over time is just how we're doing it. Yeah. For sure. I mean, the content supply chain isn't a new idea, right? Like if you think about planning, briefing, creating, deploying, measuring those are things we've all been doing for decades. Right. So what has changed?

00:14:17:29 - 00:14:37:37
不明
Well, what's changed has been things like automation. And I, you know, systems platforms are changing every single one of those steps. Right. So you can actually have generative AI help you write a brief now. Right. Take previous briefs or take previous learnings and help you write new briefs. So that strategy process can get a lot faster. You can have generative AI help to create content faster.

00:14:37:37 - 00:14:58:21
不明
You can have, automated deployment, right. And and measurement and optimization cycles. So the whole thing can actually be a lot more efficient and a lot faster, but it's still the same kind of steps. Yeah. I mean, and it is it is funny because I think what's changed about them too is they're not totally linear. No ways either.

00:14:58:21 - 00:15:23:01
不明
And the need for agility and the need to kind of pivot with the moment, I mean, we as we're launching products into the market super fast, sometimes what we, are going to go to market with literally could change based on the technology days before we're about to shift to localization, as Jason feels very, very deeply, when we throw changes their way at the last minute.

00:15:23:01 - 00:15:47:22
不明
But I think we need to build systems that are not linear in the same way that they once were. So what I love about sort of, you know, Gen Studio, what I love about this is you actually start taking all of these tools that used to be separate things, right. As a team, you might be in work front and then you'd go into Creative Cloud, then you might go into Frame.io to do some reviews and go into Em assets.

00:15:47:27 - 00:16:06:16
不明
To figure out where your content was. What's what I love about Gen Studio is you're starting to bring all that together into one user experience, into one dashboard. You can actually have everything all at once. And it's not there's, you know, there's a high switching cost, right? If your teams are switching back and forth between platforms all day long, even if it's all within the Adobe stack.

00:16:06:30 - 00:16:29:42
不明
So I love what Adobe's done about bringing all these things together to actually start having the same unified environment where you can plan and create and produce and review and publish and measure all in the same space. And that really is a game changer. It's. Yeah, it's absolutely, helped us really streamline how we operate and, and we're continuing to grow and learn from it every day.

00:16:29:42 - 00:16:57:16
不明
I mean, I think one of, we had a working session yesterday with our teams and, and, you know, part of that was and this is, you know, any great agency client relationship, but just having open dialog about what's working and what's not, what we can improve upon and, and where we can get clearer about our role relative to yours, how we can get clear about how we're using our tools, how we can make sure those handoffs are much more seamless using our tools.

00:16:57:16 - 00:17:16:32
不明
And so that's just been, you know, that's an important part of the change that we're driving as well. So, you know, it's interesting. We're we've been using all of these tools for, for as long as they've been around. We've always been customer. Customer zero. But you know, let's talk a little bit about the the model that we've established.

00:17:16:32 - 00:17:47:17
不明
And and you know I mentioned before or Jason mentioned as well that change management is half the battle. And I tend to think about this in, in kind of five different dimensions. Because this is not just onboarding to new tools. This is not just kind of changing your workflows, but it is really examining every part of your entire content supply chain to see how it can evolve based on these new ways of working, these new tools, this new technology.

00:17:47:31 - 00:18:14:21
不明
And so the way we've done it is we've kind of evaluated things on first, kind of looking at our content operations. So how do we look, across everything from the tools we use to our workflows and what that looks like. Then we have examined all of our technology. Obviously, we have the gift of working for Adobe, so we get all of our our tools first and foremost, many before they come to market to help pressure test them.

00:18:14:26 - 00:18:39:38
不明
But we've had to look at every single tool we use and evaluate, how we use it as a part of the ecosystem. We've also been looking at like, what's the right way to pilot new tools and scale what we learn across the organization. And I think that's the other key piece of this is, as are using new generative AI tools, finding a way to seamlessly integrate them into workflows is not, you know, a foregone conclusion.

00:18:39:38 - 00:19:06:18
不明
And I think you do have to be willing to make some of those those changes. Now, this is an interesting like for a brand. Expression is another important piece of this, and this is one that's often forgotten. But one of the things that's really critical to being able to scale your content and go globally much more easily and much more seamlessly is having a really clearly defined brand expression.

00:19:06:18 - 00:19:25:15
不明
And we went through, a brand redesign, and we have been going through it over the last two years. And I think that's what's enabled us to be able to scale much more easily, to build templates, to put things in express, as you saw this morning, so that we can scale, to other markets or in other channels.

00:19:25:20 - 00:19:47:03
不明
And so getting really tight and clear on your brand expression and making and enabling you to use AI, to help scale it is going to and our other creative tools is really critical. We've also had to look at our whole content ecosystem. So previously we had literally hundreds of agencies we worked with around the globe.

00:19:47:03 - 00:20:17:34
不明
And if we wanted to get everything in one place, if we wanted to move quickly, if we wanted to examine our, our content metrics and how we were performing, we literally had to kind of consolidate so that we could really see things in one place and get the most efficiency out of all of this. And so we had to look at all of the partners, all of our, our whole ecosystem in doing this, to make sure that we were getting this right.

00:20:17:39 - 00:20:38:21
不明
And then finally, we've had to evaluate our talent and work model when you need people who are going to be willing to jump in and get their hands dirty with new tools, who are going to forge new opportunities on what you can do and build with them. You need people who are willing to to change and adapt at this moment, and it's incredibly critical to do that.

00:20:38:21 - 00:21:05:00
不明
And as I alluded to before, we also had to look at how we were set up internally to make the right investment in a streamlined content supply chain. From an operation standpoint, we've even identified entirely new roles, like creative technologists who, you know, they are the people who are who are helping run these pilots. And so, so there's a lot of different things to consider as you go through this entire, this entire journey.

00:21:05:05 - 00:21:27:23
不明
But, you know, as I said, the content ecosystem in the partnership with Dentsu has been really strong in terms of helping us to navigate our way, our way through this, for sure, to help us move further and and faster. Yeah. And I mean, we just see so many benefits to this. So, like, just even the workflow piece, getting that data, that workflow data is such a game changer.

00:21:27:23 - 00:21:44:59
不明
So you can start to see how efficient different teams are, for example, is, you know, they're one team who's always getting things done faster or more efficiently or with fewer reviews than another team. But then you can figure out, well, what's working over there and how do I put it across all the rest of the team or another team that has 15 rounds of review, or a team doing its thing?

00:21:45:04 - 00:22:14:24
不明
No one has that. I'm sure we don't. So, and so that's that's a huge thing. You know, we've also had situations where where maybe something went wrong or there was a missed deadline and you start pointing finger as well. Now you have a single source of truth. You can actually go and find out, you know, where the issues where whereas before maybe you would have had to go and pull timesheet data and go and, you know, look at email chains and look at work back schedules that are in various Excel spreadsheets and things like that, where now you actually have a single source of truth to go, well, you know, where do we

00:22:14:24 - 00:22:34:38
不明
actually miss a step in this process? You can kind of figure out and fix it next time. So again, having that single source of truth to pinpoint where the issues are can really change things. You know, the other thing that I think we love is that to come back to the generative AI piece, I think often, you know, there's a bit of a fear that maybe creatives are not going to embrace generative AI.

00:22:34:43 - 00:22:54:44
不明
Because maybe, you know, competing with how do they work or might replace them someday, things like that. And we're finding the exact opposite that our creative teams absolutely love the generative AI capabilities in these tools. And they're so excited by what it lets them do, right? Firstly, it takes away a lot of the mundane tasks, right?

00:22:54:44 - 00:23:16:13
不明
If you grew up as an art director or designer, you often have to be pushing pixels around, you know, taking things out of the background and all that can be done at the push of a button. With some of these tools that Adobe has launched a generative skill. And there's also, you know, just this ability to have something in your mind and see it immediately.

00:23:16:13 - 00:23:32:43
不明
You type the right prompt, and all of a sudden it's there. You don't have to sketch it out with, you know, in pencil. You can actually see it and that is such a gift for creatives to really be able to have it come to life so quickly. The other thing about this, just as an agency is it really is an interesting use case for an agency.

00:23:32:48 - 00:23:55:44
不明
If you think about the content supply chain, you know, it shows why you need to have a creative agency partner that can really do end to end creative. You need the right production partner who knows how to produce in these kinds of environments, and then to have a production scale production company called Tag, that is really an expert of this kind of stuff, and it has leaned into a lot of the automation and, and offshoring that's required.

00:23:55:48 - 00:24:21:04
不明
And you need to have the right software implementation and CSS capabilities, which we have through our company. Merkel. So it really becomes a great use case for why you need to have the right agency partner that can put all those things together to be able to, to help go on this kind of journey. Well, and it's it's interesting too, because, you know, what Jason was saying about generative AI, and kind of how that can can be such a huge unlock.

00:24:21:04 - 00:24:46:50
不明
I mean, we've used, a lot of this in all of our campaigns, but what we find is that it enables our creative teams to really focus on the big idea and not the minute details of of execution in the same way that they once had to. I mean, we used to have to, to literally handcraft every version of every resize every, you know, every different localized version.

00:24:46:50 - 00:25:14:27
不明
And now we have the tools. They can do that in a much more seamless, seamless way. And, you know, I think one of the things that we think about as we're, we're embarking on using these new tools is like, how do we kind of think about what might be next and how do we build systems that are scalable and flexible enough so that, that we can continue to adapt and change as the tools enable that much more for our teams?

00:25:14:32 - 00:25:41:23
不明
Because it's only going to continue to accelerate. And, and, you know, as Jason said, sometimes that can then that can create some, some fear. But at the same time, it should create a lot of excitement for all of us about what's going to be possible. I mean, Laura, our CMO, spoke this morning on stage about how creative can be the heart of building a brand and ultimately what enables to differentiate your brand and set you apart and drive deeper connections with your customers.

00:25:41:23 - 00:26:10:09
不明
And and so if we are all clearing the way for people to focus on the big idea, to focus on the work, not focus on how the work gets done, that's just a massive unlock. And so I think as we've built campaigns like some of the ones you're seeing here before, it's just that much more critical for us to, to be flexible, to bring these tools into bear and to be able to focus on the big idea of the creative and let the rest, the rest flow.

00:26:10:14 - 00:26:34:36
不明
You know, it's super interesting. I always joke that technology's a lot easier to change than people are. You know, I feel that very deeply myself. But it is, but it is also about creating an excitement and an energy about what's possible with our teams, and what they can be capable of with, with these tools at their disposal.

00:26:34:36 - 00:26:52:05
不明
So I'm curious to hear what you're seeing with other clients as well. Yeah. No. For sure. And I think this is the last slide. So get your questions ready. Because we'll start stopping for Q&A in a second. But you know, what's exciting about this is I think every conversation we have is different because this is such a bespoke journey for each company.

00:26:52:06 - 00:27:12:35
不明
Companies are coming in, starting in different places and have very different needs. Right. We've had conversations with clients in the food and beverage space, where you're all of a sudden talking about, can generative AI create the right melted cheese? Look for the cheese pull for my pizza. Or, you know, having the right freshness of a tomato or an avocado.

00:27:12:39 - 00:27:33:27
不明
But you can also have conversations about, you know, if you're a highly regulated company, very conservative company, like, how can I make sure that my generative AI content is going to be Ada compliant or is going to be FDA compliant? Right. So, you know, you end up having very, very interesting conversations. But I think there's four basic entry points, that we've seen, which you can see up there on the slide.

00:27:33:27 - 00:27:55:24
不明
The first one is people just being overwhelmed by that spaghetti mess. And you know, all of a sudden they need to create 500,000 assets. So I can't keep up with my content needs or I can't scale to meet the demands of the personalization. And, and all these different platforms, or I'm trying to be more global, but I can't keep the right local and regional nuances involved.

00:27:55:29 - 00:28:14:39
不明
The second thing is around that kind of content, asset management ecosystem often being really messy. And so, you know, what we talked about, you might have content on a SharePoint and on Dropbox and on people's hard drives on people's desktops. So I can't find the right content. I know we there's great content. I know we created the right campaign and there's assets.

00:28:14:39 - 00:28:33:20
不明
I want to reuse, but I don't know where they are. I can't find them. Right. And so that kind of content, ecosystem thing is a big one. The third one is around content analytics and not knowing what's working. I think a lot of people have invested in media analytics, over the last 5 or 10 years. So, you know, what media channels are working with with some level of sophistication.

00:28:33:20 - 00:28:55:40
不明
We often don't know what content is working. And how do you separate out your content, from your media channels. And so trying to figure out how do you measure content, is really, really important. And the fourth thing is around process improvement and automation, right? I was talking to a customer recently who said, I have a 2025 marketing vision, but a 1992 org chart.

00:28:55:44 - 00:29:15:19
不明
Right. And so, you know, my systems are outdated, they're broken. They're not fit for purpose. People are using word docs and Excel spreadsheets. You know, every every team is using a different process. How do I get everyone on one shared system and one shared source of truth, to be able to drive that kind of transformation like that, that would be such a, an unlock to helping us move forward.

00:29:15:24 - 00:29:36:53
不明
And then what's the right change management. Right. And so the other way to look at this is kind of the demand we're seeing from, from a few different, verticals. Right. So, so one of them is in a highly regulated categories like finance or, or health care, pharmaceuticals. Content governance is so important. If any of you work in those categories.

00:29:36:53 - 00:29:52:03
不明
Right. These are categories where if you run the wrong asset, you could get fined millions of dollars or you could go to jail. That's a pretty high bar for needing to get your content right. And so having that kind of right content governance, you know, what's being created and where it's being created and where it's being deployed is so important.

00:29:52:08 - 00:30:07:09
不明
And Adobe has put a lot of content of care. And you saw some of it in David's presentation this morning around some of the compliance layers. Right? You're not just having generative AI create stuff and put it out without any human review. There's a lot of guardrails that have been put in. Adobe has been really thoughtful about this.

00:30:07:22 - 00:30:25:08
不明
The same with the generative AI capabilities. With Firefly, you can make very brand safe content because, you know, it's been trained on, the right kinds of stock. It hasn't been trained on the open internet, on your on your baby photos. And so you, you have a certain level of safety, which is great. And we're finding customers really respond to that.

00:30:25:13 - 00:30:37:59
不明
The other use case is we're seeing a lot of is in the retail segment, right. Because there's a lot if you're working in retail, a lot of price item kind of stuff. Right. So bananas might be on sale in Phoenix and avocados are on sale in Chicago. And we just ran out of eggs in the entire country.

00:30:37:59 - 00:30:59:41
不明
So I have to pull all the egg advertising, and, you know, if you're a retailer, you might have tons of different banners across the country. So having the right geo location is really important. So there's a huge need for a sophisticated content ecosystem to manage all of that. Thank you all for joining. We appreciate it. And and we hope you enjoy the rest of the summit and contractually obligated to tell you to take the survey.

00:30:59:43 - 00:31:06:41
不明
There you go. Actually leave us a five star review like your Uber driver. Thank you all. Thank you.
