00:00:00:05 - 00:00:27:02

I'm Jamie Brighton and part of the Am product marketing team, and I'm joined on stage by two fantastic presenters from our customer, Kroger. We've got, Lamb and Fran, and they are going to introduce themselves over the course of the presentation this morning. So I want to take you back to a Saturday just before Christmas, a house full of people, full of family.

00:00:27:07 - 00:00:48:05
不明
Everyone's feeling the Christmas spirit. Everybody is in the front room watching some repeat on television, some Christmas special from about five years ago, as always, seems to be the way. And I decide that it's time to break into the Christmas cake that my mum had brought. And I had my eye on this Christmas cake ever since she arrived for the Christmas holidays.

00:00:48:10 - 00:01:09:05
不明
So I creep out into the kitchen and I take a very small slice full of juicy raisins. Hopefully all like Christmas cake. You're with me on this journey with the Christmas cake. I'm a massive Christmas cake fan. One of the best reasons about best things about Christmas for me. So I have my little slice of cake, and then I go back into the the living room, and I'm watching TV.

00:01:09:10 - 00:01:30:40
不明
A little while later, my wife Catherine comes in and she says, did you not think that maybe somebody else in the house would have wanted some of that Christmas cake? Now, I clearly defined that I had a small slice of this Christmas cake. So I'm thinking there's something going on here. So I head out to the kitchen and lo and behold, there is basically the smallest piece of Christmas cake left on the tray.

00:01:30:44 - 00:01:58:46
不明
And I'm looking around and suddenly I notice that there are some of those big, fat, juicy raisins on the floor. What's happened here? Clearly, I can understand. She thinks I've been a bit greedy, but, I mean, I like my food, but there's no way that I could eat an entire Christmas cake in one go. So I look around the kitchen, and lo and behold, the most recent addition to our family, an 18 month old border collie puppy dog tucked away in the corner of the kitchen and his dog bed, looking rather sheepish.

00:01:58:53 - 00:02:20:43
不明
Which is appropriate for a sheepdog, obviously. And looking rather full. So we have a bit of a laugh about this kind of audacious cake theft that has happened. And then suddenly I recall in the back of my mind that potentially raisins aren't the best thing for a dog to consume, so suddenly I'm panicking. What do I do when I panic?

00:02:20:50 - 00:02:47:07
不明
Google dogs and raisins 30s later, I'm in a world of hurt, a world of pain. Thinking that I've killed Otis. And that, you know, everything's going to go wrong. I also get distracted by some sort of kind of competition on Reddit about whose dog could eat the most raisins and survive, which seems a bit strange, but thankfully my wife Catherine is is a lot better under pressure, let's put it that way.

00:02:47:13 - 00:03:07:08
不明
And in her mind she's like, right, we've got insurance for Otis. The insurer is going to help us. So she goes to the insurers website. Within a few minutes, she's on a phone call, video call with a vet who reassures us that, you know, as long as we get Otis to, to a vet to be seen in a relatively short period of time, everything should be okay.

00:03:07:13 - 00:03:32:51
不明
They send Catherine a text with a link to the nearest 24 hour vet hospital, and actually help us to get an appointment for Otis. So we race Otis to the vets. This is at Christmas time as well, so it's out of hours. And the experience that we have with the vet is incredible. They're incredibly calm, despite the fact that it's late and it's over Christmas, and they've had all sorts of other crazy people bringing their, fur babies in.

00:03:32:56 - 00:03:52:10
不明
And they reassure us that everything's going to be okay. I won't go into the details of what happened to Otis. It wasn't particularly pretty, but he was okay. And two hours later, two hours after the the whole incident has happened, we find ourselves back in the house. Otis is feeling a bit sorry for himself, but he's okay.

00:03:52:15 - 00:04:23:17
不明
And, And there is Otis, actually, And I think Otis has hopefully learned a valuable lesson. We'll come back to that in a little bit in the presentation. But I've learned a lot, actually. I've learned that in critical situations, having access to reliable and authoritative information is crucial. Knowing, you know, I went down a rabbit hole on Google trying to find out information, but my wife had a very calm approach, and she got information from our pet insurer really quickly.

00:04:23:22 - 00:04:44:41
不明
And secondly, for me, as I was able to reflect on what had happened, it underscored this need for, relevant information and a personalized journey. And it was only really after we got back that I thought about how joined up the experience was. My wife was able to easily find the information she needed from the pet insurer. They had links with the 24 hour video vet.

00:04:44:52 - 00:05:11:23
不明
They were able to send us through geolocation to the right place to have Otis seen, in a really short period of time. So clearly not every interaction that you have with your customers is going to be about life or death. But I think there is one truth, which is every interaction that you have is an opportunity to, show that you understand who the customer is, and to effectively deliver real value to them.

00:05:11:23 - 00:05:40:34
不明
And that's what we're going to talk to you, today about during this presentation, if I can kind of signpost where we're going, you know, I think we want to make sure that we set the stage here for a connected experience. We understand how important it is to actually connect the experience. You're going to hear from Kroger about some of the work that they've had to do to transform their approach to technology and their business to actually take advantage of this.

00:05:40:38 - 00:06:05:06
不明
And I want to end the presentation, talking about a relatively new concept within Experience Manager and within the Experience Cloud, which is this concept of intent aware experiences and show you a few of the innovations that we're bringing to market and that we've launched as we've gone over summit, as we've come to summit to really help you as you're in your organization, to capitalize on this concept of intent to share experiences.

00:06:05:11 - 00:06:18:25
不明
So you joined us at 9 a.m., so you've already passed the test. But here's a question. Anyone want to guess what 5000 or 400 are on this slide?

00:06:18:30 - 00:06:23:51
不明
Shout out anyone please.

00:06:23:56 - 00:06:58:26
不明
Sorry. This. Yeah. It wasn't far off, actually. That's a very good one. Anyone? Anyone else? Person. Brilliant. That's about the level I expected after at 9 a.m.. After the bash. Thank you sir. So the average consumer, we as average consumers are subjected to 5000 plus marketing messages every day. We have about 400 milliseconds to sort that. The message that we're seeing think about whether we're going to respond to it.

00:06:58:26 - 00:07:32:04
不明
So we are inundate it with communications, marketing messages, a couple more stats promise that won't be too many more stats 80% and 70%. If anybody. Seamless journeys 80%. Oh, what? Yeah, I thought I had 80% of consumers say they want a joined up experience. And you know what we might call a seamless journey as a marketer? 70% of executive marketers say that it's challenging to actually to do that.

00:07:32:04 - 00:07:56:20
不明
And we did some research, in Europe last year, actually, that, was a bit staggering, which said that, 40% of organizations felt that just being able to get the customer's first name and put that into a communication constituted personalized action, which is clearly some way away from having a seamless, personalized journey across every interaction that you have with, with an organization.

00:07:56:25 - 00:08:19:30
不明
So we're going to try and address that in the presentation this morning. And we are, you know, obviously trying to address that in general with the experience cloud applications. So it's it's really easy to stand on stage and say there's a real problem because consumers want this and marketers aren't really, you know, doing it. But we know that there are some real, blockers and some real challenges to actually making this happen.

00:08:19:35 - 00:08:44:31
不明
Fragmented data and content, often not in the same platform as where your journeys are being actioned, limit your ability to actually execute across channels. Poor workflows often, prevent, you know, scaling and consistency. And, you know, that's not a, sort of reflection of your, ability to set the processes up. It's typically the way in which the, the products that you're using are not integrated.

00:08:44:31 - 00:09:20:19
不明
The technologies are not able to integrate. And then critically, you know, coming from where we have done with the category of digital marketing at Adobe, having the data to understand interaction and understand the feedback and provide that into your systems is critical. So what we often find is that organizations end up with a fragmented approach, and for the end consumer, it feels like a really disconnected experience, a disjointed experience, which leads to, as you would expect, poor engagement, poor overall kind of assessment of the experience and low conversion rate and lost revenue.

00:09:20:23 - 00:09:54:17
不明
So what's our approach to this? How are we thinking about helping you to organize your data, content and journeys together? We love a good market. Actually slide at Adobe. And I'm, you know, no exception to that. You've hopefully, you know, seen all the way from Shantanu and Anil's messaging on main stage all the way down to many of the breakouts that you've been in this week that, you know, we fundamentally think that you have to take an approach where your data and content are together in the same platform so that you can then, really start to, to action the journeys, and you can see some of the components that are, that are

00:09:54:17 - 00:10:24:18
不明
critical to this. I'm going to come back to this area of content, on on the slide that is there at the moment, because this is a new, a new concept, this idea of an intent aware experience. And there are various components that go into that, that you need within your, your content platform. But where, you know, where we understand, I think the idea around decisioning, making, you know, using systems to make a decision about what the next offer, what the next promotion is to serve up, to an individual.

00:10:24:23 - 00:10:48:07
不明
What we're where we're now in this journey is how do we actually orchestrate that journey? On behalf of the individual, how do we take that decision? How do we take the maybe the offline data science that you're doing in your organizations to understand customer lifetime value, next, best offer and marry that with contextual awareness of the specific interaction that somebody has with you at that point on one of your digital channels.

00:10:48:12 - 00:11:17:19
不明
So this is the technology approach. And then we think that you don't have to try and boil the ocean. You know, you don't have to invest in all of these technologies and all of these approaches. All in one go. There's a kind of a I think there's a maturity curve here, or at least a like a phased approach to, to this whole process, starting with making sure that you just have the ability to deliver a consistent experience and then starting to think about how you take that consistent experience across channels and segment it based on your audience types.

00:11:17:23 - 00:11:40:19
不明
And then, you know, moving beyond that to slightly more sophisticated. How do you use the intent? How do you use the signals that a consumer is giving off? On a channel? I say consumer, I mean digital citizen. If you're in public sector, I mean, you know, somebody in a buying group, if you're in a B2B organization, these are all, you know, applicable, you know, concepts of targeting and getting relevant information to them.

00:11:40:24 - 00:11:57:47
不明
And then, you know, I think a critical piece of the missing in, in these kind of campaigns, in this approach is how effective has the content been? We're used to understanding at a campaign level. You know, how effective, you know, how many sends we made and how many opens we got, and, you know, did it drive some conversion?

00:11:57:52 - 00:12:28:28
不明
But it's often, you know, often what's missing in that is an analysis of which assets actually moved our customers to interact with us to make a purchase. You know, and how can we use that to inform at a more granular level, what we're doing from an overall content strategy. So just that, you know, if we go into each one of these in a, in a, in a little bit more detail, what we're effectively saying is centralizing content management, which enables your teams to more efficiently create content.

00:12:28:38 - 00:12:51:37
不明
But then, you know, I think the term that we are talking a lot more about in digital marketing is how do I reuse or repurpose the content that I've already created? Many organizations that we speak to, they've invested in Dam, they've they've got an asset management capability. People upload assets with, you know, the best intentions, but they often download an asset to use it and then simply re upload the same asset.

00:12:51:44 - 00:13:09:46
不明
So we end up with duplication. And it can be very difficult for people to actually, you know, find assets that have been used in a previous campaign, let alone understand how much impact they actually had on the performance of that campaign. And then, you know, we speak to a lot of companies who they work with multiple different agencies every time they do a campaign.

00:13:09:46 - 00:13:33:32
不明
It's an entire new briefing, an entire new set of assets, which all gets dumped into the dam with the best, you know, intentions in mind, which clogs up the dam, makes it really hard to find that consistent, consistent, content. And that leads to errors. It leads to errors in the messages that you're putting out. It leads to a lot of, you know, duplication of work.

00:13:33:37 - 00:13:57:22
不明
So we centrally manage the content. Then I think the other concept here is, certainly something that's important to us at Adobe is gone. Are the days of your your dam being simply a dumb folder where you dump everything that you need for your campaigns and your, your assets. We very much think now about digital asset management as being a place to activate, brand experiences.

00:13:57:26 - 00:14:22:11
不明
Whether that's knowing that they that you have the rights to use the image that they're compliant with particular, you know, legislation in a market where you're, you're acting or being able to put the power of, you know, remixing an asset using generative AI through fire, fly into the hands of, you know, a marketer who maybe would typically have had to go and brief a creative agency every time they wanted to get a slight variation to a particular asset.

00:14:22:19 - 00:15:00:05
不明
But knowing that they can do that and make sure that it's on brand. So we centralize we provide the generative AI capabilities on top of that, that forms that like a single source of truth. If we then connect the dam up to the other applications, and I'm talking in in general terms here, whatever your digital marketing stack is connecting your, your dam and your content management capabilities to your email means that you have a single source of truth for managing the content and the experiences, and you should then be able to push that content out onto any of the channels that your email tool or, you know, your your mobile messaging tool is capable

00:15:00:05 - 00:15:31:43
不明
of communicating to. And then I mentioned the content effectiveness. Hopefully many of you are in the the main stage keynotes. Over the last few days, you've seen the content analytics capability that we're bringing to market. You know, there are some nuances to that product, the level of granularity that you can go down to in terms of understanding interaction with an individual asset, like an atomic asset that you're, creating through the automatic tagging of those assets using computer vision.

00:15:31:47 - 00:15:51:39
不明
Is going to be a game changer for understanding the performance of all of the campaigns and the and the assets that you that you own within your organization. So this is a the kind of general setup. The thing I think the, the landscape that you need to be thinking about, the place that we're operating in, what I want to do now is welcome, Lamb and Fran from Kroger to the stage.

00:15:51:48 - 00:16:15:34
不明
And I want to say as well that fresh from Kroger winning the conductor award, this year's Experience Makers award. So round of applause for Kroger. Fantastic work. Hopefully you're all familiar with the Experience Makers Awards. They are a great, event that takes place, at the start of the of Summit Week, but we accept submissions for that for those awards all the way through the year.

00:16:15:39 - 00:16:38:11
不明
It's a great way of showcasing the work that you are doing with your within your organization, you know, using the experience cloud technology. So I wholeheartedly encourage you to, to think about submitting for that for next year. So with that, I'm going to hand it over to lamb from, thank you. The other follow this amazing, British accent and the voice that's all I've got going or near is good.

00:16:38:16 - 00:16:58:51
不明
All right. So we're going to show you where we're headed when we call the email of the future and our path, our paths, and where we're going to go to. So first, some quick introductions. My name is lamb. I'm the leader, marketing technology at Kroger. And then we have I am Fran McCoy. I lead our digital communications team.

00:16:58:51 - 00:17:21:03
不明
So in charge of all of our email, mobile push SMS and. Yes. Yeah. And then, sorry about that. And in charge of my household, I also have an interior, so I. Yeah. Jimmy went like ten minutes on his dogs. I'm like, I'm gonna get, like, at least 30s for my little babies there. So, like, thank you so much for, looking at an interior.

00:17:21:08 - 00:17:42:52
不明
So, who is Kroger? We are one of the largest grocery retailers in the United States. That comes with a lot of complexities. So we do have, within those 2700 stores, we have, we're known as 20 different, banners or different names. So a lot of versioning that has come with that. We also have to support so much.

00:17:42:52 - 00:18:16:42
不明
We have 2200 pharmacies. We have field centers. We sell, we sell produce, we sell paper towels, we sell a lot. So a lot to support. We also have a path where we want to go to 1 to 1 personalization. We see personalization from a scale from relevant to one on one personalization. And our goal is constantly to move that lever from more from the relevant to more of the 1 to 1 true personalization with our customers getting them the right content at the right time, at the, at the right channel.

00:18:16:53 - 00:18:47:05
不明
So this is and also so our motto is, is that you're only as fast as your slow as process. We actually have a other an actual motto that like has like curse words in it. But I'm not going to show that today. Like literally like so we intentionally looked across the board and created a foundational layer of technology to make sure that we were, we were automated and we were using the right technology.

00:18:47:11 - 00:19:14:17
不明
And we did that with Adobe. And I got 10% off just for saying that last word. But like, but like, so, like, for instance, like we can have the all the data we want, we have all the data for customers are buying, but without like content, we can't deliver that. You can have all the content you want, but unless you have the data and the relevancy science models and you have the delivery systems automated, you can't get it to the customers.

00:19:14:22 - 00:19:37:28
不明
So we're going to show you our path to how we got there. Yeah. So for our vision, what we really wanted to do is identify what is our goals within our digital communications channels. And we've you email, mobile, push SMS, all of your outbound communication channels as the gateway to our digital properties and also the in store. Right.

00:19:37:28 - 00:20:02:27
不明
We have a huge physical footprint throughout the entire U.S. you want to make sure that we're supporting that as well. And we want our content to excite and inspire our customers. Food is something that a lot of people have a lot of passion about. They have history about they have nostalgia, about, so yes, promotions and coupon clipping is, is a history as well.

00:20:02:29 - 00:20:28:56
不明
But we want to speak to people how they want to interact with us from a food perspective, from how they go forward and shop. So we want to make sure that engaging with Kroger is easy and enjoyable and leverage a pool of content to serve customers that content at the right time. So make sure that the communications are not promotion centric or product centric, but customer centric.

00:20:29:09 - 00:20:55:32
不明
And speaking of their own experience as it comes to food, whether you be somebody who you know you're making your meal plan or whether you're somebody who's buying the fruit, the frozen food, whether you're somebody is cooking together as a family. So we want to make sure that we can relate to the customer through our communications and speak to them, how they best, want to interact with us from a food and, and, shopping experience.

00:20:55:37 - 00:21:15:05
不明
So we'll start with what we, where we at then pass. So, we call this email to pass. This is like five years ago. So essentially mass targeting right. Like the most basic of targeting you like avocados. We're going to like you buy avocados. So we'll target avocado emails to you. So like very basic targeting like just as relevant.

00:21:15:05 - 00:21:37:32
不明
You buy avocados you go right by eight avocados. There's a lot of avocado sales throughout the year. Like we avocados are on sale every other, every other week. So every single time there was an avocado sale, we had to create new content every single time, very minute. And then also manual tagging. We're like, oh, this email is about avocados.

00:21:37:37 - 00:22:06:47
不明
So like we had to tag it manually. There's somebody literally just like their job is to identify the tagging of each email where we are at now and into the future. So true. 1 to 1 personalization. We are we in. And we have stored all these content modules, that are available to the customer. So we have like thousands of pieces of content in a content in our content hub, what we call an ATM.

00:22:06:52 - 00:22:36:00
不明
So, every each customer essentially is each piece of it. Sorry about that. Each content is, scored for each customer, depending on how relevant for this. For them from 0 to 100. And then at every single day customer we sent out to the customers their most relevant modules, programmatic storage with a and then send we, connect that to Salesforce Marketing Cloud to then deliver the emails.

00:22:36:05 - 00:23:00:10
不明
You have a generic AI tagging. So like we we don't there's no somebody in the mail anymore looking at like, what is this email about? Or what is this module about? We have AI tagging that can within am that can say, oh, we can identify this as an avocados. And we have, beer and wings. This one is about fuel points and automatically tag those and that are, relevancy models.

00:23:00:25 - 00:23:25:44
不明
Then use those tags to that score for each customer to then deliver it to each customers. We have native connectors in and out of an from work front, Am from Am to all of our systems, YouTube, Salesforce, Mark cloud, all these are all connected and automatically deliver to the customer. All right. So how are we getting there?

00:23:25:49 - 00:23:46:07
不明
So we want to make sure that, you know, from, our build perspective that we are constructing, the gateway to move forward. And we want to make sure that we're speaking to both our digital and our in-store customers. And really key to that is not only speaking, but listening and understanding what the customers are saying.

00:23:46:11 - 00:24:14:13
不明
So leveraging, digital engagement, data shopping data, we're able to personalize that content for our customers. And a major thing we wanted to unlock with this effort was Azlan was speaking to, you know, we were producing one piece of content for one communication and then two, three weeks later producing another piece of content. So another avocado sale, and sending it again.

00:24:14:18 - 00:24:35:33
不明
Well, we want to our content to be more efficient. We want to make sure that we're eliminating single use content and our content can work more. And that way we can actually get more content into market, and we can have more breadth of content that we can then leverage that breadth of content to personalize for our customers. We also want to make sure that our content is flexible.

00:24:35:38 - 00:25:00:25
不明
Right. So with AMM, we've been able to load all of our content in, through, the metadata and allow our content to be modular. So it's independent of channel. We're primarily utilizing in email right now, but we've developed for the future. Or we can bring it into our other broadcast channels. And we want to make sure that we're prioritizing that content within the communication as well.

00:25:00:25 - 00:25:35:24
不明
So our content is not structured to just be, you know, one singular format. We're able to leverage different format and modularity for different prioritization. And what we're currently doing now is we as long was speaking to, is we use our own in-house data sciences to personalize that content. And we are continually evolving those sciences. I think last year we ran we, we went through 30 or so different evolutions of those sciences, in order to continue to personalize that content for our customer.

00:25:35:29 - 00:26:03:17
不明
And what this allows us to do is send emails that are personalized to customers in real time, so we're able to leverage those static moments in what has traditionally been a or, sorry, those customer moments, and when it's usually been a very static channel. Right. We're not generating or audiences two weeks out building up the email and sending it know we're getting a daily feed every, every day of what, content is available and, and what's most relevant for the customer.

00:26:03:17 - 00:26:26:40
不明
And matching that with our communications that are going out the door to populate that content. And so this allows us to have that more relevant communication and allows us to also incorporate live customer data. So channel that can go very stagnant very quickly is now much more relevant. And what's really unique that we're doing is we're actually building the entire email at the time of the send.

00:26:26:40 - 00:26:51:11
不明
Right? So everything is built in content fragments that are then compiled into the email at the exact time that we're sending it out, which is really the great revolution. And it also created a lot of efficiency from our build process, because we're not having to replace this content over and over and over again. It's it's building itself, feeding in through a daily, feed that we get.

00:26:51:16 - 00:27:13:39
不明
How we're constructing this within our communications is that we're making sure that, we're theming. So speaking to the agent tick tagging that we're doing, we allow our content to be cohesive and make sure that our communications stills have a theme to them. So they're not, you know, a sporadic mix of a different of different pieces of, promotions or what have you.

00:27:13:44 - 00:27:37:11
不明
And we want to make sure that we're structured to align everything within one communication. So, you know, currently we're doing, themes around whether it be sales, loyalty, seasonality, right, and expanding upon those and building upon those as we build out and mature and what's really enabled this is the automated tagging that we have that is running through Am.

00:27:37:11 - 00:28:03:02
不明
So basically our AI agents are looking at that content within and tagging it. And then that is and feeding back into the sciences. So finally, as I stated, all of this is automated. So we can build the email automatically. We can inject that content with the metadata. We can then that is all then paired with our decisioning engine and then build the email at the time of send.

00:28:03:06 - 00:28:32:53
不明
And what this is really evolved into is that we've moved beyond, communication measurement and communication deployment and moved to content measurement and content deployment. So, you know, we're looking at how content performs not only within one email we send, but across a series of different communications. Right. So we're making sure that we're evaluating what's truly resonating with the customer and focusing on what is driving those click through is what is driving that engagement.

00:28:32:57 - 00:28:47:02
不明
When I don't know if anybody here is a customer or not. But some of those emails can get pretty long. So we want to identify what is that true lever. And we're able to do this through the unlocks we've done through this system.

00:28:47:07 - 00:29:12:21
不明
So how are we going to how are we getting there? So here our focus is for 2025. First is continuous automation and enhancements in our Adobe systems. First, we're having all our counters within Adobe, work front planner amazing system. We, so at every single moment, we know all the content that should be available to the customers in work front because the calendars are integrated.

00:29:12:26 - 00:29:34:17
不明
Secondly, a tagging. So like I say, we're we're constantly evolving our tagging. So it's like gets smarter. It can identify each piece of content and what the content is about. It's just like more in depth and just like, oh, this is a this is that avocados are this is a hamburger. But like very in-depth, the colors of the email.

00:29:34:17 - 00:29:57:21
不明
What like what colors resonate with the customers. So we the AI tagging identifies all these metadata. And then we can constantly evolve our data scientists to say, oh, this resonates with customers. So we're going to like and customers are using, are buying these things. And then combine that all to get the perfect content for every single customer.

00:29:57:26 - 00:30:20:07
不明
Secondly, as I said before, like we can our data sciences can tell us at every single customer moment what email or what communication they should get. But like if we don't have the content for that, then we fail, right? Dog? We can say that like a customer buys a Puppy Bowl and cover my puppy food. Oh, this customer looks like they have a new puppy, so we should send them a puppy email.

00:30:20:07 - 00:30:41:56
不明
But without puppy email or without, like, dog content. We can't do that. So we're using Adobe Creative Cloud and Adobe Firefly to create, to programmatically create creative assets at scale. So we if we say we want a piece of content for a customer, it's available for that customer. Then finally evolving our, sciences, our air traffic control.

00:30:42:01 - 00:31:12:57
不明
So at every single moment we have 10 to 15 test alerts going on using test and controls. So we have a global control. And then we're constantly testing different sciences and different relevancy models to say, hey, this one using transactions and and using opens and then using clicks. Like if we combine the three and but like 40%, more engagement on email on opens and then like, so then we should send that content that customer.

00:31:13:06 - 00:31:34:36
不明
So we're like using, our, test learns to evolve our scientists to gauge the best content for every single customer, every single time. So then, like, if their sciences are good, we kind of push it out to production if, Hey, like these, this is, like, bring back engagement to sciences. We can pivot or deprecate that at every.

00:31:34:51 - 00:32:02:53
不明
So every month we, look at the sciences and then we, we, put, push out the ones that are working, and we deprecate the ones or pivot the ones that are not. Yeah. So what's the outcome? We've been able to unlock the 1 to 1 personalization, right? We're aligning with our customer interests and we're providing a personal experience for our customer based on how they're engaging with us as a brand.

00:32:02:57 - 00:32:26:41
不明
For content. Right. Our content is now more efficient, more flat, more effective. We're allowed we're able to go to that right time, right place, right channel. And we're making sure that our content frequency is based on how you engage with us. Some people want to engage with a daily communication from us. Some people want to just, interact with us when they're getting ready to put their shopping list together that weekend.

00:32:26:56 - 00:33:08:56
不明
So utilizing our personalization scientists, we're able to identify what those key frequencies and communication are and, communicate to the customer on the frequency that they want to. Finally, this is an unlocked a significant amount of production efficiencies, right between implementing and planning within work front, connecting that and flowing all of our, content creative into, am and then we have our own in-house sciences that are referencing all the campaigns that are stored within work front and looking at the actual content itself that is stored within Am, and then sending that over to our ESP as a decisions, which content is best for our customers.

00:33:08:56 - 00:33:23:00
不明
So it allows us to really, create a lot of efficiency where this was all manual previously, and now it's all automated and interconnected.

00:33:23:05 - 00:33:29:33
不明
Super. Oh, yep.

00:33:29:38 - 00:33:52:30
不明
Fantastic. So, you know, relating this back to that story, you know, why did the guy come on and start talking about his border collie? Here is a great example of an organization, a massive organization, thinking about how they provide authoritative content to their customers and, become a source of, dependability and truth in terms of the offers and the promotions and the relevant information that their customer organization needs.

00:33:52:35 - 00:34:10:36
不明
And I think, you know, while also seeing great benefits in terms of the production efficiency and the way in which they manage the experience. So there's a win win for the customer and, for the organization. So I mentioned in ten, to our experiences, I think we, we believe that we're now moving into this space. You've heard that.

00:34:10:36 - 00:34:36:46
不明
You've heard us talk about the evolution of customer experience management into customer experience orchestration. And we believe that, we as a technology company need to provide the tech to help you as a, as organization to actually provide these intend to our experiences for your end customers. What is an intent to our experience? Well, we could you know, we could debate the various nuances of this, at length, I think.

00:34:36:46 - 00:35:16:03
不明
But fundamentally, we think it uses AI to understand a user's needs, anticipate their goals, and enables you to tailor and adapt the experience, to provide that true personalization and truly relevant experience to them. So it takes into account the context which I think many, many experiences are missing at the moment. There's a lot of work done to understand, you know, the longer term decisions about what product to serve, what promotion to serve, but less about, less ability to take into account the immediate context of an interaction that you're having, with an individual or an organization on one of your digital services.

00:35:16:08 - 00:35:53:23
不明
So what do we think you need? So we saw this this diagram on the the overall market picture a little while ago. There are seven components. To this I'm not going to go into each one of those in detail, but I think that, you know, moving beyond simple kind of content management and experience management, combining your CMS and your the where that the place that you store your content with your data and analysis capabilities means that you're able to capture intent, you're able to take advantage of decisions, whether that's from a data science platform or from an agent that is helping you to understand, you know, decisions about an individual you're

00:35:53:23 - 00:36:11:00
不明
able to take into account context, the context of the interaction. And that could be as straightforward as the type of device they're using. Being able to serve a different version of a promotion based on the bandwidth that's available or the size of the screen or the, you know, the digital surface, you need to be able to to build the experience.

00:36:11:00 - 00:36:31:49
不明
Sounds basic, but, you know, you need to be able to sort of, pull together all of the assets, all of the templates, all of the relevant, elements to create an experience that will render correctly on the end device. And you increasingly need advice from the platform as to what to, what to assemble and how to bring that together.

00:36:31:49 - 00:36:56:03
不明
And I'm going to talk a little bit about some of the innovations that we're we're bringing to market in this space. You need trust and governance. You need to be able to actually, you know, you need to know that your teams feel confident that the, the, the assets and the content that they're selecting from within your, your content management, brand safe are relevant for the individual and meet the kind of legislation that might be active in a particular market.

00:36:56:14 - 00:37:16:27
不明
And then you need to be able to take action on that insight. And we at Adobe, particularly with an experienced manager where, you know, we're creating and moving our innovation roadmap to help organizations to deliver these in tend to our experiences. We have three pillars. So generation is more than just the creation of the original, content.

00:37:16:27 - 00:37:39:41
不明
It's about how you, reuse, repurpose and put to good use, all of the assets and the, the materials that you're creating. I talked about activation thinking beyond the kind of dumb repository or the folder that somewhere on the web where you simply place all of the assets that you've created to a, you know, a proactive place where you can activate the experiences that are relevant.

00:37:39:46 - 00:37:56:31
不明
And then optimization is that critical part, is a critical part of the overall thing. So optimizing the experience based on the real time data that you're able to get in, and make sure that every time you have an opportunity to serve, you're taking into account the latest interactions and the latest, you know, data.

00:37:56:36 - 00:38:19:14
不明
And that is underpinned by, you know, this idea of the content AI Foundation, which is where an experienced manager, we're able to tap into the agents that we're creating within the experience cloud and then a trusted governance layer that means that, you know, you are you know, that the content that is used can be trusted within all of the kind of governance controls that you have within your organization.

00:38:19:18 - 00:38:40:08
不明
So I just want to sort of for the last few minutes of the presentation, we've announced a lot of new capabilities for Experience Manager, specifically over the last few days. And I'm not sure that you would necessarily have seen all of those things in one place, because we've got lots of presentations about AMM assets and lots of presentations about a and sites and forums and all of the good stuff.

00:38:40:08 - 00:38:59:27
不明
But there are a few things that I think it's really kind of worth reiterating. If you are an Am customer, or you're looking at a some real, you know, some really kind of game changing capabilities that we're bringing to market. So the first is, a reimagination of the interface with an experienced manager, which sounds quite straightforward.

00:38:59:27 - 00:39:22:23
不明
But, you know, I think we, in a place where we want to open up experience manager to many more personas within your organizations. We've had some great conversations with customers this week where, you know, they are very clear about who the roles and the type of people within their organization would ever log in. Experience manager to author or manage content.

00:39:22:27 - 00:39:44:59
不明
And that is often, you know, at the exclusion of people in marketing or creative teams. We think there's a lot of scope for those types of persona within your organization to have access to the types of data and the genetic workflows that we're now going to be able to expose through, Experience Hub. The guys from Kroger talked a lot about the AI tagging of assets.

00:39:44:59 - 00:40:06:38
不明
We're we're working really hard in this area. You may have heard of smart tagging. We have new capabilities. I think one of the challenges with something like, smart tagging, which for anyone who's not familiar, it takes an asset that you upload into the dam and it applies various, you know, intelligently applies metadata to it based on, you know, computer vision and various other capabilities.

00:40:06:42 - 00:40:39:45
不明
One of the challenges of that, though, is it still relies on somebody who's looking for those assets who've been tagged to understand the particular keyword to trigger, to bring that asset up. And so these new enhancements are going to enable you to do semantic search, natural language search within your, repository. To have the platform actually surface all of the content that could be relevant, not just based on the specific kind of tag that you've used to search or the specific filter, and that has a real part to play in, something that we call content advisor.

00:40:39:50 - 00:41:03:52
不明
So, we've for a little while now, we've had the idea of the asset selector, which is a way of, you know, contextually bringing up assets that are available within your dam. Taking that to the next level, when you're looking for an asset, we believe the platform should be able to make intelligent recommendations to you about the right assets to use for the particular campaign or the particular experience that you're trying to create.

00:41:03:57 - 00:41:29:42
不明
This goes to the, you know, this goes further with the idea of experience building to take a campaign brief that maybe you've uploaded, you know, into work front or that you just have available that's governing how you're thinking about this particular campaign and have the platform then make recommendations to you about template, about assets to include content fragments to bring in, based on things like previous performance and an understanding of all of the content that you have across your repositories.

00:41:29:47 - 00:41:56:16
不明
And then something which, sounds a little bit kind of more tactical at first blush, but I think is, you know, just as important. And I'm going to have just as much of an impact is a direct connection between experience manager and Adobe Adobe Journey Optimizer. So with this new integration, you're able to create the content. You know, this comes back to this idea of a single source of truth for your content.

00:41:56:29 - 00:42:15:59
不明
Create the content. Once in an and then use content fragments in your communications in Adobe Journey Optimizer so that you know that you've got that consistency, you've got that control over the content that's being created, but you'll then able to surface that in, you know, all of the different channels that you have with your, with your customers.

00:42:16:04 - 00:42:22:57
不明
I'm just going to play a really short video of that. In action.

00:42:23:02 - 00:43:01:26
不明
Now let's go visit George, a lifecycle marketer, Ezekiel Bank, who has been working in Adobe Journey Optimizer on the campaign definition, email creation and mobile experience. Based on the campaign brief, George has designated existing student accounts without credit cards as the target audience in Journey Optimizer. George is ready to create the email for this journey, which will redirect to the secure Bank web page created by Christine, and a WhatsApp reminder that is triggered for any user who abandons the form for the demonstration will focus on creating the email in Journey Optimizer.

00:43:01:31 - 00:43:35:33
不明
Let's go take a look within Journey Optimizer, George can use the same content for the secured bank web page via the content fragment. Saving George time and ensuring content consistency across channels. Reusing shared content across touchpoints also makes any future content updates easy that can be made once at the source, so they're applied everywhere. George could also leverage email templates, insights, as well as images stored in assets for experience authoring and journey optimizer.

00:43:35:38 - 00:44:05:49
不明
But for this demo, we'll focus on using content fragments for email creation. George opens the Content Fragment selector in Journey Optimizer and selects the student card content fragment. In the Content Fragment selector, we can see that it contains multiple elements such as the logo, a banner, a title, and multiple variations of marketing copy. George uses the same logo and banner for the web page, but he selects the email specific headline and marketing copy description.

00:44:05:54 - 00:44:35:20
不明
After making the selection, the content is included in the email code and the email is ready. George now takes a look and previews the email writing journey Optimizer email editor. Everything is looking good. Now that the email is done, George needs to also create the WhatsApp message for his journey and journey optimizer. In this demo. We won't dive into this, but it is a new capability that is slated to be available in Journey Optimizer in the first half of 2025.

00:44:35:25 - 00:45:00:14
不明
Now, with all the components in place, the email, the web page, the WhatsApp re-engagement message and the campaign definition, George is ready to launch the credit card campaign. There we go. So just a short run through of some of those capabilities. So I just wanted to kind of wrap this up. You know, we've heard, I think a fantastic story from Kroger about some of the benefits that they've been receiving.

00:45:00:19 - 00:45:23:24
不明
This is not specific to retail. You know, Real Madrid's one of the largest football clubs in the world, has hundreds of millions of fans that they want to engage in various different, locations around the world, even including, you know, while they were with the club, actually at a game, they've seen, you know, an incredible increase in revenue by centralizing their content management and deploying it across those different touchpoints.

00:45:23:29 - 00:45:48:37
不明
Telmo is a telco out of Europe, using AI to drive personalization. Another winner of an Experience Makers awards. This week, and you can see from Vanguard as well, scalable content reuse has a real impact on their efficiencies and on their business. So what do we cover? We covered, some set up around why we think it's important to connect the experience.

00:45:48:51 - 00:46:19:50
不明
We heard from Kroger on some of the changes that they've made in the way that they think about technology and, and the process moving from, you know, thousands of very similar avocado emails to email of the future. And, yeah, I think that this is, you know, the message I want to leave you with here is that we are really looking to help you address that within the Experience Cloud, particularly with an experience manager and our integrations with the other applications to really enable you to understand customer intent and kind of capitalize on it.

00:46:19:54 - 00:46:47:11
不明
If I have a call to action, you know, where do you get started? We've been talking a lot of this week with customers about, you know, I can see where I want to go. Hey, I can see what 100 looks like, but I'm just not sure how to get to one. You know, and I think some of the, the slides at the start, the talk about this phased approach of consistent content and then thinking about, you know, segmented and then, sort of trigger driven, journeys are a great place to start.

00:46:47:16 - 00:47:12:24
不明
We think that, you know, scaling the content creation and management is critical. So having a like a secure content foundation, which then enables you to within the parameters of your organization, capitalize on things like generative AI, connecting your CMS with your, your email platform, your outbound messaging platform is, is critical. We obviously want to make that as easy as possible within the experience cloud, family of products.

00:47:12:24 - 00:47:38:11
不明
But also, you know, whatever ISP you're using and you, you know, you heard from Kroger that they're using various other ISPs as well. And then I think you also need to be thinking about this concept of content aware experiences because your, you know, your competitors are out there trying to be contextually relevant as possible with, you know, with their customers, with your customers setting your organization up, to think about these kind of capabilities is is critically important.

00:47:38:16 - 00:48:01:42
不明
So, you know, I think that that brings us to the end. We've got some time for questions just to finish the presentation. I'm afraid Otis did not learn his lesson from the, from the Christmas cake. This was him. Caught red handed, taking the scraps off the side. But, hopefully, we have sort of given you a bit of a lesson around in tend to our experiences.

00:48:01:42 - 00:48:14:20
不明
And joining up the dots today. Wonderful. I think that's all we've got time for. So thanks very much indeed. And, Fran, thank you very much for attending this morning. Thank you. Enjoy the rest of summit.
