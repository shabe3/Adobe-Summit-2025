00:00:02:24 - 00:00:25:54

Welcome everybody. I'm Ben Stobart and I'm joined by Ravi Powell. He's global CTO of Ogilvy One. Today we're cutting through the noise. Let's talk about AI and what it really means for enterprises. So we want to make sure that we're covering the spoke to rebrand business and customer relationships. Ravi, as we know, is in an inflection point.

00:00:25:58 - 00:00:50:24
不明
Years of digitization, automation. We're seeing a platform decay. Some describe it where you've got prioritized short term gains over long term integrity, whether that be brand or where the business is going as itself. But as you start to look at where AI is positions, what's your view of enhancing consumer trust rather than eroding it? And then how do you actually do that?

00:00:50:25 - 00:01:12:31
不明
What are your thoughts on that? I mean, I think it's a very timely conversation. As you know, that we're also going through our own AI journey as an enterprise. Every every organization, every brand will have their own journey, unique journey. But I think the core principles apply. So you're right. Sometimes we can be swayed by the euphoria of new technology.

00:01:12:36 - 00:01:33:48
不明
AI's happens to be this profound new change that we are all witnessing. But I think if you go back to simple, basic principles of how we made decisions for the best of our business, we could still deal with, you know, the concepts like platform, decay, etc.. So if you think about it, customer first and technology second to in this case I second.

00:01:33:48 - 00:01:59:19
不明
So you can still make the right decision to ask yourself the question. If I use I, am I using it to better the customer experience how customer interacts with my brand? You can look at your, you know, employee augmentation. So think about how you're going to extend the human agency or your employees so that they can partner with you in achieving your business objectives.

00:01:59:24 - 00:02:21:18
不明
And then if they have to deliver value, then you need to define value. So what that value is. So for any automation technology you would imagine productivity is a byproduct. Right. So that's there. But how do you define additional value. How do you create some you know ROI gains for your business or your, you know, overall objectives if you a marketing organization.

00:02:21:19 - 00:02:42:27
不明
So I think those three core principles that has always worked and I think that should work for this change as well. But it has to be underpinned by, you know, the transparent, ethical, secure use of AI that will give you, like this holistic, you know, set of principles to, to allow you to, you know, navigate to this, you know, change and ambiguity.

00:02:42:32 - 00:03:10:36
不明
Yeah. Absolutely. And I know you and I have discussed this a lot, that while you can talk about short term and long term in this ideal position of where AI is, this does seem to be two tiers of businesses, one where adoption is happening quite quickly and successfully, but where others are still falling away. So I wonder, while we talk about this conversation mattering now, which obviously it does, every conversation has got this in.

00:03:10:40 - 00:03:33:55
不明
What are the key steps an enterprise needs to take to futureproof the business? Maybe you can touch on that first point that we were discussing earlier in the week, which is understanding whether is AI the problem or is it something else? I think I don't think there is the problem. So let let me, frame this in, you know, kind of broad buckets.

00:03:34:08 - 00:03:58:14
不明
Yeah. So think about it this way. Like any transformative shift in technology leads to for us to ask these questions that has happened in the past when, you know, cloud came through or even even when internet came through. Right. So the three frames that, you know, we should look at are future proofing your organization. And Watson's, look at the roles.

00:03:58:19 - 00:04:18:36
不明
Look at the processes. And look at the ways of working. Right. So think about from the employee first perspective. So that's one frame. The second frame would be the look at your data strategy. Because most of the companies by now have a data strategy. They had identified this, you know, in the last decade or so that data is going to be the new oil.

00:04:18:37 - 00:04:40:11
不明
So they do have and every company has a data strategy, but they need to relook at it with the the, you know, usage of AI or the the introduction of a new technology into their landscape that relies on good data. And then the third frame will have to be. So how do you use the core, you know, aspect of your business which is being customer centric.

00:04:40:12 - 00:05:02:33
不明
Right. So how do you create growth? By being, customer centric or designing relationships with your customers? And between brand and customer, which are unique for your customers. So I think that's how I will frame these, these principles that that should help us, address your, you know, the the question you had. Yeah. So do you want to take us through those three pillars?

00:05:02:33 - 00:05:24:40
不明
Because certainly the one at the end which I took away was, was about relationships. But, what what about the first pillar? Because I think that when we talk about adoption and who is adopting early, why does the gap exist when some are adopting very well and some aren't? G, do you want to touch on that first piece?

00:05:24:45 - 00:05:49:02
不明
Yeah. I think there are, there are general, you know, scenarios and circumstances. So keeping that aside so that we do don't sound too generic and try and keep it, little bit more specific. If you think about it, there are two kind of, you know, spectrums. We can't touch on everything to let's take two kind of spectrum side.

00:05:49:03 - 00:06:13:08
不明
So there could be there could be a customer who is, you know, waiting on the fence. They want proof of value to emerge and then, you know, sort of dive in and see, you know, how they're going to take advantage of this. And there could be a customer who's looking at it from, you know, right. The trend get ahead of the competition and, you know, create enough differentiation so that they can win the right side.

00:06:13:08 - 00:06:37:57
不明
So in both cases, you would still have to go through the, the core. You know, changes or the principles if you if you look at from, you know, future of organization or future proofing your organization standpoint, why should the roles change? Why should the process change? So let's say in one case you buy a technology and you want to bolt it on top of your existing process.

00:06:38:02 - 00:06:58:49
不明
How's that going to, you know, affect or create value for you? If you had a bad process, your desk automating a bad process, none of us want to do that. I mean, you and I and our, our day to day go through, you know, we question our processes at times and we want to, you know, kind of relook at other work gets done and not necessarily there is a process let's automated.

00:06:58:49 - 00:07:21:36
不明
So you want you want to unbundle your current process. Think about the core steps of how work gets done. And then, you know, look at where the infusion of this technology is going to create some efficiency, some productivity gain that will lead you to, you know, look at so what what should the new roles on our roles that needs to change work.

00:07:21:46 - 00:07:45:00
不明
So here is an example. Right. The we are working in this creative space. So take creative as a discipline. So today creative comes up with an idea. But then they also have to run with the process of creating several variations and scale them out. If there are, you know, geographies involved, then you have to create several translations of the creative output.

00:07:45:05 - 00:08:06:47
不明
But if you if you change that process in the right way, the creative could now focus on perfecting that idea, create that unique, you know, on brand creative that you know, your customer is going to like, and then let the technology take care of, you know, creating new variations, creating, you know, translations, creating. You know, or solving the scale problem for you.

00:08:06:52 - 00:08:33:39
不明
So that's our goals and processes would change. But I will add one additional thing. And then, you know, while the workflow processes need to change ways of working also needs to change. So with the same example, when you unbundle, something and you look at, you know, where you need to infuse, intelligence into your process, you also want to figure out then how do you kind of validate that change because this is new.

00:08:33:45 - 00:08:54:30
不明
So we should, you know, lose the sight of, you know, this this is a new technology. And the proof points are limited. So for you to, you know, quickly validate that proof that, you know, there is ROI at the end of this, and then scale it. So having that delivery process or a rigor that works for you as an organization is equally important.

00:08:54:34 - 00:09:23:40
不明
So and in summary, I think the vision to execution, these are few, you know, areas one should look at to for be successful. And in summary I know we spoken about this a lot to change management of opening hearts and minds of, of people to absorb. That seems to be one of the parts as well. The ability for people to embrace the benefits of AI and AI is somewhat dependent on that human aspect.

00:09:23:40 - 00:09:50:31
不明
Coming in at the beginning, which I think is is one of the successes of change management and one of the successes of policies being changed and approaches being changed. It can only be changed if people are open to them. So I think that's a really fascinating part of the journey. Moving on to, again, something very technical, but also very, I suppose, relevant to the people element of AI, which I think is constantly the discussion.

00:09:50:36 - 00:10:11:51
不明
So data silos. So you make this phrase data silos aren't technical but they're political. And I think that's quite an interesting view whereby you can have this perfectly tied up box of this is our data, approach. And this is what we should do for good governance. And this is our approach for how are we going to use it is the vision.

00:10:11:56 - 00:10:40:44
不明
But taking data and moving it into an end to valuable product or entity is very, very hard to expand on that. This second pillar of data and how silos, while technical, rooted in a lot of the time in company politics, like I said, I think we need to relook at, you know, it as you know, as we are doing all organizations, all enterprises need to relook at their data strategies.

00:10:40:44 - 00:11:06:45
不明
So data problem is not new. I remember in 1999, first time I worked on data mining problem. So, you know, and we've seen several iterations of, you know, innovations in data space from big data to data lakes. And even in data engineering space. We've seen innovations. To me, I think most of the organizations have kind of reached a point where, you know, it's harder for them to now find new ways to break those silos.

00:11:06:50 - 00:11:26:35
不明
And some of those silos exist for socio political reasons, like, like, you know, you and I have discussed, somebody, you know, some company acquired in other companies or, you know, brought a new set of tools, governance definitions. You have different departments. Their incentives are not aligned. So, you know, they continue to work in their own silos.

00:11:26:40 - 00:11:49:08
不明
There is operational data, there is strategic data. So there is there is a genuine, reason why some of these, you know, islands and silos exist. What we need to do, when we look at AI, is kind of relook at these data governance strategies with, with a different AI because your data preparation changes. Your, your AI is as good as your data.

00:11:49:08 - 00:12:09:31
不明
So you need to prepare data. Your data needs to be clean. Otherwise you will be spending wasting a lot of time and resources and training and the AI will the bad output. You need to make sure that the data is labeled correctly for, you know, the models to be trained or, you know, in some cases fine tuned to work for your cause or your input.

00:12:09:36 - 00:12:35:53
不明
And then finally, you know, the, the new, spectrums of compliances that come with AI. So that's one aspect of it or one pillar of it. But then there are, you know, technical challenges. So you don't want to now, you know, the open your entire data strategy. You probably want a more holistic integration strategy. So take as an example, I'll take a couple of examples so that it becomes real.

00:12:35:58 - 00:13:00:24
不明
You have let's say any customer today has a data lake. But for AI, when you talk to a knowledge repository and you want to, you know, sort of discover or, retrieve information, we call it search use case, then you have lot of these unstructured, you know, knowledge documents available coupled with, you know, some structured or semi-structured, you know, data stores.

00:13:00:28 - 00:13:31:21
不明
To build that, you need new plumbing infrastructure on data. So where does that fit. So you're going to augment your current, you know, entire data hub strategy or data lake strategy with the new tools and technologies for you to enable this new application on the other hand, you can have a scenario where, if I take the tool that we are building internally for our teams, you may be looking to find something which just becomes a function call, and it could be just an API call to an existing system.

00:13:31:21 - 00:13:59:04
不明
So you don't need to break anything. You just make sure that your application has an API which is well-defined so that your, you know, I can just do a function calling. But if you had a complex query and you know, you wanted to for your, you know, agent architecture to then dismantle that query into reasoning planning and then identify how it is going to go talk to different data stores, come back, please summarize that.

00:13:59:04 - 00:14:17:25
不明
And then, you know, you know, bring it back to you. That becomes a complex use case. And for that to work you should have trained your, you know, AI to be able to reason to be to be aware that, you know, how is it going to go and talk to different data sources. So as you go on that spectrum, your use cases become complex.

00:14:17:30 - 00:14:54:55
不明
But and but that's where the value is. And you will have to unlock that value eventually so that therefore the relooking or, you know, inward looking for how you are going to enhance and improve your data. I call it a new integration strategy where you probably have to bring, you know, several data sources together instead of, you know, creating another platform and then bolt on top of it, a federated strategy where data products are still owned by, you know, if your your socio political structure allows for, you know, marketing door and a certain database sales to on a certain database so they can act like a data platform, you know, platform owners, but then

00:14:54:55 - 00:15:32:10
不明
make sure that is accessible and available for people who are creating these new valuable use cases for you. Pretty interesting. I mean, if you are to look back at probably some of the biggest core challenges of of our clients and even ourselves as we've gone through this journey is that it seems to be the same old challenges that we've had, which has been silos, one, unlinked strategy or strategy that doesn't link everybody together to have a common goal, and sometimes compliance potentially getting in the way of, of entities coming together through no fault of their own.

00:15:32:15 - 00:15:51:13
不明
I just find it interesting that the same challenges that come up traditionally are also coming up again. Now, we should get away from, for for those that are going to be successful in this space. So, I think the shared accountability is something that really is going to drive this. So it's funny, isn't it, how the same things keep coming up.

00:15:51:18 - 00:16:14:12
不明
Yeah. Just wanted to move on to, as you know, probably a more favorite subject of mine, which is about the end. The end result when we're talking about this is great. So how are we actually having return on investment? And you and I have talked about the tangible strength of let's not just automate, let's not just look at this as an efficiency and forget about it.

00:16:14:16 - 00:16:41:48
不明
Approach AI needs to strengthen customer relationships, but actually the benefit not just automating and taking out, effectively layers. What's your view on that? And then more importantly, how departments are able to take this back and show genuine growth, which shows genuine return on investment, which is sometimes been, a little bit of a hindrance for the martech space in the last 3 to 5 years.

00:16:41:52 - 00:17:02:25
不明
Do you want to talk a little bit more about personalizing the experiences but at scale, and how brands might struggle to use? Sometimes users effectively as they're looking at is just an automation grace? Yep. No, I think that's that's the crux. At the end of the day, you know, whether you you retrain your employees, create new roles or, you know, redefine your processes.

00:17:02:25 - 00:17:31:12
不明
End result is we want to make sure that, you know, we are able to create these strong bonds with our with our customers. I think the personalization, or creating these, you know, unique bonds, which goes beyond personalization as well because, you know, it's it's it's a different gradient where you are in the life cycle. So you may be looking at it, let's say if you on an acquisition, theme, you may want to look at what kind of dynamic content I can create using AI.

00:17:31:17 - 00:18:04:26
不明
But can I also help me predict the scoring of that dynamic content for a given segment, for a given channel, so that I know that, you know, I'm not creating inventory of waste, and I'm creating something that actually is going to work. You can look at it from a commerce lens and you can say, I've got 100 skills and I've got, let's say, 100 different kind of, you know, personas that, you know, I need to probably, you know, serve these product descriptions or SKU related information to and if you, you know, go through channels etc..

00:18:04:26 - 00:18:28:44
不明
So these become thousands of variations. Right? So how can I help me create unique product description as Ravi wants to see or Ben wants to see even the imagery or, you know, creative around that product. The tone and tonality of that, you know, product description. So can I help me create that sort of scale, or scale the personalization.

00:18:28:44 - 00:18:52:08
不明
Right. And then we talked about, you know, the translations, etc. if you add the geography or, or market regions to it. Right. The third is look at social space. Right. So, how can you be ahead and let's say, there's a, there's a solution that we're working on. As your a very influential a shield. Right. So every brand has influencers or who are great.

00:18:52:08 - 00:19:13:13
不明
Right. They bring in, you know, customers and helps with the acquisition. But what, if any comment creates negative publicity. So, you know, can I help me sort of identify that in time, create an alert and let the brand or brand manager know that this could lead to a negative publicity and sort of, you know, help me so nip that in the bud.

00:19:13:13 - 00:19:46:13
不明
So there are all of these different scenarios where, you know, you can use AI to address the personalization problem. If you switch to from, you know, more B2C cases to B2B cases, and B2B, we've we've sort of looked at personalization very transactionally. Right. So if today you and I get bombarded with a lot of, you know, vendors trying to reach, reach out to us for new technology tools and you will see a very generic approach, and both of us will be given probably the same message.

00:19:46:13 - 00:20:10:06
不明
It'll spectrum of our roles, irrespective of our interests, like, but within B2B, also identifying that buying group, identifying them as individuals, their interested and then crafting, you know, personalized messages that work for them depending on their roles and their interest and their intent, as well as on the channels that they are there on and would like to receive that message on.

00:20:10:06 - 00:20:33:22
不明
Like if you're a football, enthusiast, is it being published on one of those sites where you are. Right. So I think we can look at both spectrums and then use AI to genuinely, you know, create create a differentiation for, for the brand and businesses which really want to create these new avenues of, you know, forging, unique 1 to 1 bonds.

00:20:33:27 - 00:20:51:03
不明
Yeah. Look, you know, that you and I can talk for hours on this subject to, I know that we've been right at the coalface of having to do with this last thought. When we talk about strategy, we talk about design. Have you got literally one minute for us to talk a little bit about how you would approach this?

00:20:51:03 - 00:21:17:49
不明
We look at this with relationship design within Ogilvy and understanding all of the facets you've talked about that if you got a one minute closing for people to focus on, when we talk about design and bringing these goals together. Yeah. So relationship design is our unique proprietary methodology. That's that's our philosophy. Ways of working. But truly what it is is that it allows us to create a unique proposition for each business.

00:21:17:49 - 00:21:49:12
不明
So, you know, what does the brand wants to speak to their customer? What is their business ecosystem? What does their customer want and why they want to buy from this brand, what kind of data they have. So how do we create value using that data? Our technology investments, they have already made, and then come up with this relationship platform that creates unique, differentiated outcome communication, creative, platform, journey so that, you know, we can achieve the objectives that we can.

00:21:49:17 - 00:22:19:44
不明
But it all starts with what I call, you know, an assessment. So as a business, you may want to start with saying, are you ready? Have you looked at all aspects of your AI strategy. But as we talked about you know, people process ways of working. Have you looked at it from your data infrastructure, your technology infrastructure, even architecture blueprints that, you know, would you be able to introduce a new technology into an ecosystem where your IT teams may not be ready?

00:22:19:44 - 00:22:43:13
不明
They may they may have to develop new control centers. You know, being able to create trust with the business that, you know, we can identify the metrics that allows us to learn about how this model or how this AI is working in the production so that, you know, you don't have the trust deficit or erosion of what we call the trust with your customers by creating something negative.

00:22:43:28 - 00:23:04:45
不明
Or putting something, you know, which is not a quality product out there. Right? So I think those are the two crux, but relationship design sort of at the center of it is is our way of, you know, doing this for for our customers. Well that's great. Thank you very much. I know we're going to be talking more about this as summit, as we come up to that in the next few weeks.

00:23:04:49 - 00:23:22:54
不明
Yeah. Thank you. And and like I always say, you know, this is, an important talking topic for us as well as for all of our clients. So, you know, this space is evolving at a very rapid pace. And I'm sure, you know, we will we will continue to have more discussions around this. Thank you. Thanks once again.

00:23:22:58 - 00:23:46:48
不明
Thanks, Ravi. And thanks to everyone who joined us. We look forward to see everyone at summit. Please come up and say hi to us. In summary, making AI work is going to be work, but not doing anything is going to be critical to your business. So as we say, let's get beyond the hype, make eye work for us and not the other way around.

00:23:46:53 - 00:23:47:26
不明
You.
