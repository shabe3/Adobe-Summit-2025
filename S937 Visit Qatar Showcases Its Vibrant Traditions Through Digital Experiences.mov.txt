00:00:00:08 - 00:00:50:41

Good morning. Good morning everyone. Welcome. Everyone made it to this, first session. On the last day. We are very happy to, to have you here. And, we are going to talk about delivering vibrant digital experiences, for the third quarter, of course, with the help of, Adobe. Our particular focus is a little bit on setting up teams to, facilitate, actually, how we use the tools that we have at hand, in a more innovative approach to create really innovation for anyone that may have, been here yesterday and, what's the keynote, the Marriott keynote, where Marriott's, I think it was the global head

00:00:50:41 - 00:01:21:01
不明
of marketing orchestration, acknowledged a little bit around how important processes are. I think the session today will also give you a good idea or maybe some ideas in terms of how you can start setting up such processes and really taking the leap in that, and of course, we will give you some insights on the process that we went through when, we created our latest innovation, which is the generic concierge that you would see later as well.

00:01:21:06 - 00:01:51:44
不明
Introduction. So I'm the one on the left here. My name is Barbara. I come with, around 15 years of experience in digital marketing and, product management. Country. Director of digital experiences and products with Visit Qatar, which is Qatar's national tourism board. Previously, I spent most of my career actually working for airlines. So I have extensive experience in the, travel, the tourism and the transport industry.

00:01:51:49 - 00:02:16:22
不明
And, I led large digital transformations. I enable teams to deliver great products, a multimillion dollar revenue and, award winning innovations as well. And I'm looking forward to share with some of you, today the approaches that helped me to actually enable that for the teams that you should if you want to introduce yourself. Thanks for. Good morning again, everyone, and thanks for being here, especially after the bash last night.

00:02:16:22 - 00:02:36:36
不明
So we really appreciate it. My background is in tech for many years, from retail to automotive to travel. And my role is that I work very closely with Barbara to make things happen. So that's that's what that, Yeah. Thank you. Right. Okay. After we introduced ourselves, we want to know a little bit about you as well.

00:02:36:38 - 00:02:55:22
不明
So a little bit of interaction. I know it's difficult on the last day. It's just a show of hands please. And we are going to start very, Easy. So who of you here? Just a show of hands is working in the travel industry. Oh, great. That's the vast majority. Okay. That's excellent. Now we are talking about team size.

00:02:55:22 - 00:03:15:36
不明
And when I say team size, I mean your organization. So, for example, if you're working in digital marketing how big is your digital marketing team? If you're working in product how big is your product team? Soft hands please. Anyone that is working in the organizational team, up to 50 people.

00:03:15:41 - 00:03:52:44
不明
Okay, between. Nice. Thank you. One, between 50 and 250. All right. The majority more than 250. Excellent. Also, a few people. The last question, let's talk about your audience. Actually, let's look at, website visitors, monthly website visitors who has an audience, monthly website visitors of 5 million, up to 5 million.

00:03:52:49 - 00:04:20:33
不明
Thank you. More than 5 million a month. Excellent. Who doesn't know? Okay. No one. That's excellent. All right. Very briefly about, almost specifically tourism in Qatar. Last year, in 2024, we welcomed 5 million international visitors to Qatar, which is, the highest number that we've that we've ever seen. A nice increase also versus the previous year.

00:04:20:33 - 00:04:46:55
不明
And yes, it's also more than, they are actually, residents in Qatar. Our target is to achieve 6 million by 2030. So we are well on track to achieve that target. And, the success, actually is primarily driven by a mixed approach to attracting international visitors, mainly an audience of, families, couples, stopover visitors. We are attracting miles traffic.

00:04:46:55 - 00:05:06:30
不明
So focus on events is a very big, area for us, covering both large events as well as more midscale events and regional events, with a particular focus on sports events.

00:05:06:35 - 00:05:38:50
不明
Now, of course, all of this, is supported by our digital experiences that we are in charge of. As a tourism board, typically, we are placed, more at the, upper part of the purchase funnel or the consideration funnel. So people visit our properties basically to gain an initial overview to gain inspiration, to maybe get some facts right about the country, about, visa, what they need to take care of.

00:05:38:55 - 00:06:05:35
不明
At the moment, we are not, offering any transaction on our digital properties. So for that, we are actually handing over to all of our, partners. That's going to change soon. But for the time being, and there's no, there's no extra conversion on our website or no app. And of course, one of our focus areas is that we are going to connect our digital properties across the whole journey that a visitor does with us.

00:06:05:39 - 00:06:26:57
不明
So not only from the beginning, but more specifically also focused on the in destination experience going forward. And with that brief introduction, I'm going to hand over to Di you us to tell a little bit about the context on why we embarked on an innovation journey. Thank you.

00:06:27:02 - 00:06:33:36
不明
Okay, I if I come up this way, thank.

00:06:33:41 - 00:07:15:32
不明
So as we have seen in, in recent months and years, it's all about AI, data and everything else. However, the travel industry has been historically, a little bit slow in terms of, adopting innovation. And there are many reasons for that. You know, the old tech setting, the, the, non-digital native nature, of the industry as well as that asset heavy, investment as an entry barrier for some, you know, disruptors, because I think in other industries it's easier to disrupt, but obviously we have seen some major disruptors as well.

00:07:15:37 - 00:07:40:05
不明
However, we see that that is changing. And, these are some of the, highlights that you can see that everyone is getting on this, eye on innovation, you know, from Europe to Asia to America and everywhere else. I think there is that national shift that is is taking place. And everyone wants to, to, to actually be part of it.

00:07:40:09 - 00:08:04:53
不明
And as part of that, you know, what are the key elements that are really important? Is obviously AI, but behind AI is the data and, and all of that advanced personalization and having the right alarms, and so on. And in terms of obviously, again, you know, we all using AI now on our mobile phones, our kids are using it doing the coursework.

00:08:05:08 - 00:08:25:11
不明
I mean, I think it's very rare to see a company who has an adopted an AI internally or, seeing family or some individuals who, haven't actually adopted AI. So I think the industry's decided, okay, now is the time to do this.

00:08:25:15 - 00:08:53:52
不明
And for us, Qatar Tourism, the big question was how can we compete? Everybody is doing this. So from all those, organizations, so the pressure is high. The pressure has been high for us to do something different, innovate, make it big and be different. And for us, I think we have some unique challenges within within the industry and also visit Qatar.

00:08:53:52 - 00:09:31:58
不明
We have some unique challenges, which I'll go through as well, which is a bit, local, local to us. So the questions, here, these three really, you know, do we have enough traffic flow for our advanced tools? Is our infrastructure too complex? Will we see ROI? I think I'm sure you, all of you, are familiar with this kind of questions, but that the unique challenge that we have, and travel, I think, is the fact that we will not purchase a long distance traveled, you know, on a daily, monthly or even yearly.

00:09:32:03 - 00:09:59:37
不明
Right? So it's, but on top of that, if we do, we still will not go to the same place twice or within 2 or 3 years, we actually go back, maybe after 4 or 5 years, if we really love that place. So that does challenges is always there. And then the other challenge that we locally have is we are competing with mass, every other destination locally with lots of innovation behind them.

00:09:59:37 - 00:10:24:28
不明
So they are innovating. They are using technology to do everything they can. So we have to do something of a different, and in terms of again, going back to data, you know, was we saying that is all of our data is there enough traffic data coming to us? Do we have the right data? First of all, we collect in the right data, and then I'll be using the data in the right way.

00:10:24:28 - 00:10:45:43
不明
So three three steps of having the right data is storing it correctly and then using it correctly. And in terms of this question, I guess that of possibly very familiar to you, to you as well, ROI is a big thing because every time we want to invest something, we have to go and get the signature.

00:10:45:43 - 00:10:53:38
不明
Okay, you're going to spend this much. How much? You're going to give us back?

00:10:53:43 - 00:11:17:45
不明
And on top of that, I think we have even more challenges. And some of it, I think is unique to us. Some of them you may also have the same, challenges. So, for example, we have a lot of data, right? You I'm sure you have the same, situation and managing data. The bigger it is managing, it becomes a bit more difficult.

00:11:18:00 - 00:11:38:07
不明
And in our case, another challenge that we have is you're not the custodian of all the data that we have, the information we have, because we have our own events, we have our own things. But at the same time, we work with thousands of other partners. There are events there offers and you know, their experiences. So all of that again.

00:11:38:07 - 00:11:58:44
不明
So we we deal with it the aggregated. And then the transaction, as I said earlier, doesn't happen on our website. It happens on their website. So again we lose some sort of some sort of control there as well. And again, you know, this need of going somewhere too far, what is the difference? What can I do?

00:11:58:44 - 00:12:19:13
不明
The is this really was there are people who I've seen or talked to that gone to Qatar. They loved it. And they want to go back to because they love the culture and everything else. But then they said, okay, you know what, I want to see somewhere else as well. So we want to see what we can do to bring them, or at least they encourage other people to, to come, to us.

00:12:19:17 - 00:12:45:11
不明
And in terms of, just imagine we've done all the great work and now comes to fulfillment. So, you coming from Las Vegas, you're going to just imagine you're going to Australia. But you said, you know what? I stopover in Qatar. Great. So you're there with us. Good. But we realized that we still don't have enough engagement with you as a as a passenger coming to Qatar with.

00:12:45:11 - 00:13:12:12
不明
We felt that there was not enough depth about the engagement that we had with you. So that's where we ask ourself. Do we have the right tools? Are we collecting the right data? Are we doing the right things? Are we running the right campaigns? So this list, I'm sure you're all familiar with all the Adobe great tools in place.

00:13:12:17 - 00:13:33:58
不明
And we said, okay, great big tick box, you know, done. And we've got the right tools. And we're good to go. But then we realize, no, we still are not delivering what the ambition of the country was, right? The ambition of the tourism board. And we realized that we still need to do more. We still need to do more.

00:13:34:03 - 00:13:58:46
不明
And then what we realized was that possibly we're not using the tools correctly. And I think that I've seen in so many, organizations that I worked with, that you buy the license for a lot of money, then you pay a lot of money to implement it, and then, you know, using it the right way usually doesn't happen.

00:13:58:59 - 00:14:25:51
不明
I think that is where what we did was we worked with Adobe, to do, sort of an assessment tool, you know, to see how mature we are in terms of using the tools. And I think that has helped us a lot because we've streamlined our processes. Our collaboration, I think has increased within the team so people know what to do and not, you know, do the same job twice.

00:14:25:56 - 00:14:45:54
不明
And also I think collaboration we all talk about collaboration, but it has to be useful collaboration. And I think having that sort of process and the assessment coming from some outside tells us, okay, you're doing great here, but actually you need to do something else here in order to make sure that you utilize the tools that you have.

00:14:45:59 - 00:15:06:50
不明
And I'm pretty sure you may have the same challenges that you got, the tools, you implemented it, but, it's not being used in the right way. All right. That's it for me. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'll take it from here further. So, yes, you have the tools, as you said. But still, it's not working the right way.

00:15:06:50 - 00:15:22:55
不明
We use the Adobe. I think it's called maturity assessment. In order to really play that back to us as well. What we were kind of thinking already we knew or something, you know, we were not using it the right way, but, it really helped also to have that as an assessment done, in a structured way.

00:15:23:00 - 00:15:39:04
不明
And obviously Adobe gives you a lot of, options and also to, to help you, to put you on the right path where you can then also measure, how you are progressing. And I'm looking forward to the, the next assessment, very soon, because I know that we have advanced quite a bit as a team in that regard.

00:15:39:09 - 00:15:57:23
不明
But how did we do that basically because that didn't just, happen because we wanted to do it. But we said, okay, we really need to plan it a little bit better, too. So we really need to, go from something that seems to be very unstructured at the moment, to something that is a little bit more structured.

00:15:57:28 - 00:16:16:19
不明
But then again, not so structure that it actually creates silos within the team. We do actually work both with teams that are based on site in, Qatar as well as remotely. So that is a little bit of a complexity there as well. So we said, okay, we need to transform really the, the way we work.

00:16:16:19 - 00:16:35:09
不明
And translation is always a big word. Right? And, I think I'm also going to just take a moment here to really focus everyone about, what we are going to talk about over the next few minutes as well. So we are not going to tell you how we specifically used, the Adobe tools to create personalized journeys.

00:16:35:14 - 00:17:00:35
不明
I'm going to briefly mention that, but I think everybody in the summit is talking about that. And, as we've also seen in the in the keynotes, in future that's probably going to be taken care of by an agent. Anyways. We also not really going to dive deep into how we automated our processes. We are really focusing on, an innovation part, right?

00:17:00:35 - 00:17:22:44
不明
How we create or how we enable to the teams, with processes, with certain frameworks to really use the tools that they have already for more innovative approaches. So that's what, the focus is going to be, and when we talk about, transformation, of course we can, we can do it in a big bang and we can announce that.

00:17:22:44 - 00:17:53:52
不明
But it's it's a journey for the team anyways. So that's the journey that the team has to go through step by step. And it often is involving actually, more of a mindset change than anything else. There are a few very crucial characteristics that I would say are part of that transformation. And from my experience, if you are not getting those things right and you are not getting your transformation right, I'm going to mention them.

00:17:53:52 - 00:18:14:45
不明
So one is when you change the structure of your team, you need to ensure that the team has, a certain size, usually that is between 5 and 9 people. Why is that the case? Because beyond nine people, you actually have a lot of complexity in terms of coordination. You have inefficiencies, and the teams are actually not able to manage themselves anymore.

00:18:14:49 - 00:18:40:34
不明
Anything below five. Usually you lack certain skills in order to be able to deliver an end to end experience or an end to end product. Actually, with the the team itself, number two, also very important, often underestimated. But I think a crucial point, you have a stable team, right? So teams that work together on a long term ongoing basis and not that are not changing very frequently.

00:18:40:34 - 00:19:14:14
不明
This is so important with regard to, team dynamics, with fostering really commitment, responsibility and also a really deep knowledge about your, your own product, about your experiences, etc.. And number three is again, something very important. You need to have one goal that the whole team basically work towards. Again, this helps with alignment, avoids conflict, it avoids competing priorities or just ensures that the team knows what they are doing and that they're working in the same direction together as a team.

00:19:14:19 - 00:19:37:53
不明
So based on that, we knew in order to solve the problem that we had with regard to under utilizing actually the tools that we had access to from the Adobe suite, we had to restructure our team and we had to create or restructure the processes of, interacting. So starting with, the team structure, as I mentioned earlier.

00:19:37:53 - 00:20:19:40
不明
So we needed to create something that is, more structured, but not a silo. What you see here is a very simplified approach. So you have the different, that product teams, the product teams, AI and campaigns as well, which are working as team teams. They are, creating their products. And then you have, martech, which is 90 experimentation or AB testing and personalization in our case, the content team and the data team, which are working as, platform teams to support those other teams, they are providing basically their product as a service to the other teams.

00:20:19:45 - 00:20:47:18
不明
And, some of you may be familiar with, this, structure from standard product development, team structures. What we did, we apply this to all of our teams. So our campaign team had a product or not a has a product owner. And, that product owner is basically, handling campaigns as a product that.

00:20:47:23 - 00:21:06:38
不明
Now, the rest of the responsibilities of the team are pretty much standard, for some of the team or for most of the team, you would have, developers. Not for all of them, but you can have an equivalent. So, for example, for the content team, the equivalent of the developer is of up editor or content editor.

00:21:06:43 - 00:21:20:02
不明
So basically the ones that are executing apart from that they will work the same way as you are already probably familiar with from, product teams.

00:21:20:07 - 00:21:56:31
不明
Yeah. Now, the next area that we needed to tackle was the interactions between the team. And here, these are basically the key points that we tackled, starting with goal setting and KPIs. So all of the teams reviewed the KPIs, we reduced the KPIs that we have. And, we created a, what we call a customer journey to be that really helped us to, visualize or help the whole team to visualize what everybody was working towards.

00:21:56:35 - 00:22:20:29
不明
We also moved to more regular Plannings. We created quarterly Plannings. And we also introduced something that's probably a lot of you also have heard of, which is OKRs for us in particular. This was important because we wanted not only to focus on KPIs, but also on increasing our maturity. And this is where I think, okay, as can be a very helpful tool.

00:22:20:34 - 00:22:44:17
不明
And the other point that was very important and I think has helped the team a lot and I've seen it, if it's not implemented go wrong oftentimes is that all of the teams had to work on, specific aligned cadence that really helped them to plan, to manage their dependencies and to, yeah, really, have have the right rhythm basically to work.

00:22:44:17 - 00:23:11:26
不明
And as long. So that's it. Some people call it people process and technology. For us we used the terminology tools, the team structures and the interactional framework for the interaction within the team. And from here on we said, okay, we're gonna take the inspiration from, the approach of launching an MVP, just testing and learning from whatever you implement.

00:23:11:31 - 00:23:49:52
不明
And we took the leave and decided to try it. Our new structure or new processes, with, specific campaign actually. So that's what we did. And we created a lot of very beautiful, personalized, tailored customer journeys, starting from when our customers are interacting with a pet at lending on our website, creating tailored welcome, flows or nurturing flows, as we call them, retargeting them based on if they're dropped off, if they continue to a certain partner.

00:23:49:57 - 00:24:19:16
不明
So all of that tailored really based on, behavior, segmentation. And also depending on the stage of the journey that, and we have the, dream plan book stages that we usually refer to if somebody is, you know, just getting inspired about a destination, really going already more detailed and planning or already, ready to convert, basically.

00:24:19:21 - 00:24:43:59
不明
What we wanted to ensure, obviously, is if we get our main focus was actually that we get the maximum learning from the team, which is also why we decided to go, during a campaign, because that helped the team really to get enough or access to enough traffic in order to generate learnings very fast. Yeah. So, that's something that I can definitely recommend in order to, for the teams to really get those insights very fast.

00:24:43:59 - 00:25:04:51
不明
Usually it does help if you leverage certain either campaign windows or seasonality windows, where you know that your traffic volume is going to increase a little bit. And you are able to generate learnings much faster. There's one thing that we also wanted to ensure, which is, we wanted to have a bit of a challenge and not only focus on one channel.

00:25:04:51 - 00:25:26:39
不明
So not only website, but we wanted to go multiple channel, which is why we said, okay, starting from paid advertising, we are including that in our personal journeys already, because that is ultimately what we want to get at and we want to take that learning already. And I think most importantly is that we we didn't want to wait until we had the perfect structure or perfect, journey setup.

00:25:26:44 - 00:25:52:20
不明
There were a lot of ideas that the team had, but at a certain point we just had to say, okay, let's go ahead. We will launch it and we'll will then see, how it goes, and take the learnings. So all of that, all of those personalized experience, of course, were, realized with Adobe. So we used a target and campaign for that.

00:25:52:25 - 00:26:21:09
不明
As I said, I'm not going to go into detail on how we set it up. I want to ensure that we continue. And, I'm going to tell you a little bit more about the next stages of the innovation journey, that, team that, through. So obviously, with all of the personalized, experiences that we created, we, or we very heavily relied on our headless content management that we were already very successfully using.

00:26:21:09 - 00:26:54:32
不明
So we use content fragments, for example, across multiple channels, very successfully. Ready, website app, emails as well. And for us, it was only natural for the team, it was only natural to then go and see if they can use, the same structure in other channels, or maybe not channels, but, engagement or interactions. Which is where they came up with, new idea and I would call it, you know, they tested the waters.

00:26:54:36 - 00:27:19:26
不明
So what they create was, a video component, which is what you see here. So on the left hand side in the video, you see beautiful, moving images of cats, with specific points of interest. And on the right hand side is where you see the specific, the point of interest being called out using the content fragment that we already have in place and that we used very successfully in other channels already as well.

00:27:19:31 - 00:27:43:55
不明
So it was something fairly easy for the team to, to use. The key, driving metric here was engagement, which nicely improved as well. Of course, applying all of this, the personalized journeys, the new interactive video component that we tried, brought a lot of, you know, learnings or, you know, learnings always start with challenges.

00:27:43:55 - 00:28:07:58
不明
I would say, and then you may say, okay, some of them is something that you could have, or that the team could have foreseen already, which is fine. But I think every team, as they go through a transformation, it's always very powerful for them, actually to experience it themselves, because you really realize how they are taking this as a challenge and really trying to solve the challenges that they are.

00:28:08:02 - 00:28:41:27
不明
That they are, you know, that the barriers that they are experiencing. So some of the challenges, that you see, on the slide here, probably, again, not unfamiliar to you. So we faced fragmented visitor identities. Of course, the team was able to find a quick fix around that to allow us, at least not only to always fall back on, the usual identifiers that, you know, the complexity of the content variations.

00:28:41:27 - 00:29:05:26
不明
Yes, definitely a challenge. It was manageable for the campaign that we did. Considering that the ten apps that we selected for paid media, owned media, our website, all of the, translations that we usually have to apply and we are translating into eight languages. So it was manageable for that, sort of trial, but we knew it was something that had to be tackled ultimately.

00:29:05:26 - 00:29:32:58

And in the term data silos, of course. Also nothing, surprising, the limitations with regard to the integration of the Adobe suite and our CDP, which is outside of the Adobe ecosystem, is also something that we faced. And then again, one of the main major challenges that the team, still came across was that there's just an abundance of, an abundance of the content that I information that we have actually available for our customers and visitors.

00:29:33:02 - 00:29:55:31
不明
And how do we better guide the visitors to find that content? The video component was already a big step in that direction, but we were still not where we wanted to be. Which is why we pushed further to innovation. Right? Again, I'm not going to talk about how we are going to fix data silos or how we are going to better integrate our ship with Adobe.

00:29:55:31 - 00:30:22:11
不明
That's not the focus of the session. We are going to, look more at the innovation journey that if we went to. So with the initial experience that the team had, rolling out this, new component, which sort a good impact on the metrics, that became a little bit more, confident, a little bit bolder in terms of the, the ideas that I brought as well.

00:30:22:15 - 00:30:58:43
不明
And, what I did as the next step was really to focus on the metric again, that I want to influence. That was key to really be laser focused on one metric. In our case, that was engagement. And look at the outside and perspective and not, and set out to really look at a user perspective. They did extensive user research, then, finding various pain points along the journey, and also from that research to uncover that finding the right information was really one of the main major pain points that the customer saw, that the potential visitors actually went to.

00:30:58:47 - 00:31:25:16
不明
So then, as I said, they started to become a little bit bolder with regard to their suggestions. And the next idea that I had was, why don't we offer, a chat bot? Yeah, the initial idea was very basic text based chat bot. And this is actually where I thought I would and still think basically that we are going to see quite a massive shift in terms of how customers, how visitors are actually interacting with content.

00:31:25:21 - 00:31:52:27
不明
So we know that there's already, hardly anybody actually engaging with, you know, long written, content on websites. We know that the shift towards videos has already happened. And I, I see that that shift is actually going to continue and it's going to move towards more conversational interaction with content, even away from from videos.

00:31:52:32 - 00:32:12:03
不明
So despite the fact that we had or the team, had this, innovative or, you know, I wanted to go a little bit more in the innovation direction. They still wanted to validate their ideas. So they did, use a mix of methods in order to validate what they came up with, interviews as well as service.

00:32:12:08 - 00:32:38:01
不明
And they found very well that the concept actually resonated with the vast majority of respondents. We were actually quite surprised about how positively they were that was, received. There were digging deeper into, you know, what would be the use cases for or what do you see the primary use cases for that? And that was really organizing and scheduling checks and also getting recommendations on travel ideas.

00:32:38:05 - 00:33:00:13
不明
So that's what the team then also focused on with the initial iteration of of our solution. Ultimately, that even went deeper and used the service that it did, in order to really identify, basically the priorities for the next, the next features as well.

00:33:00:18 - 00:33:30:31
不明
There was one or let's say two other, very interesting, points or takeaways from the user research that the team did. And again, I think I have to say for the team going through that research themselves themselves was very, powerful. One of the points that came out was that the research journey for travelers is often actually part of their travel experience.

00:33:30:36 - 00:33:58:41
不明
So when they do the research, they're actually building up excitement, rather building up the excitement of going to the destination, ultimately experiencing it. So, as we know, travel, after all, is an emotional business and remains an emotional business. So for us, it was about really streamlining and finding the balance not between eliminating that step for the customer, but streamlining it to the sufficient extent to make it a little bit easier for them.

00:33:58:41 - 00:34:32:49
不明
So that was one of the crucial points. The other aspect that the survey or that the research revealed was, which is also quite interesting. And again, maybe to a certain extent specific to travel, is that we noticed that travelers actually switch between different personas when they travel, depending on the context, of their travel. So what's the reason they are traveling for who they're traveling with and many other factors.

00:34:32:49 - 00:35:02:36
不明
Basically. So that means, Barbara, for example, she's not always a meticulous travel planner, but it really depends on the context, of her travel and, and in that regard, and that basically meant that there was an unlimited spectrum of different personas, of different nuances that the traveler can actually, assume across all of the different, for, archetypes that you actually see here.

00:35:02:41 - 00:35:32:19
不明
And the more important thing is that an individual actually switches. So it's not that, you know, this individual can always be addressed as a meticulous planner. It really depends on the context. And when you have this sort of the or the need for this flexible and really, yeah, nuanced approach, then generally comes in and, yeah.

00:35:32:19 - 00:36:02:36
不明
You think that that could be a good, technology maybe to solve that problem, which is why the team actually explored that and faced the dilemma. Because, yes, we needed something that is very flexible. But at the same time, we also need something that ensures that the content that we display, that the assets that we display the descriptions is accurate.

00:36:02:41 - 00:36:35:30
不明
We cannot show wrong information, we cannot show wrong imagery, opening times, etc.. So we really needed to find something that was able to combine the flexibility of and, with our existing content structures, translation structures as well. And this is again where we went back actually to our, content management tool and the usage of, content fragments ultimately.

00:36:35:30 - 00:37:05:49
不明
And, I'm going to show you what we came up with. What does the future of tourism look like? It's personal. Me visit Qatar's AI concierge, your travel companion, designed to turn your journey into an unforgettable experience. It listens with cutting edge speech to text, to say the word and instantly discover everything Qatar has to offer.

00:37:05:54 - 00:37:26:19
不明
It understands. From exclusive events to hidden gems, it tailors your journey from start to end, making each moment in Qatar uniquely yours. It guides change of plans. The shuffle mode. Instantly adjust your itinerary until it's just right.

00:37:26:24 - 00:37:59:39
不明
It connects. Craving culinary excellence directly. Reserve your seat at Doha's Michelin star restaurants. It's there for you. Your interactive AI concierge provides real time local insights reflecting Qatar's warm hospitality, ensuring every moment of your visit is seamless and unforgettable. Meet the future of tourism meet. Visit Qatar's AI potential.

00:37:59:43 - 00:38:29:06
不明
Okay, thank you. So I think that gave a good, idea in terms of what we created. The problem it solves for us really is, is access to the right content at any stage of the visitor's journey. It's the only AI concierge that we've seen that really integrates text, voice. You have rich content, a map, a virtual human, conversational and a planning interface.

00:38:29:06 - 00:38:59:30
不明
So you had the trip planner as well? So it really creates a truly interactive experience. It includes generic must see attractions and Qatar points of interest, restaurants, as we've seen. But it also includes events. So I've pulled in specific events, and specific limited time offers as well, and then puts that in their recommendation, power through the, content fragments that we already use and other and other channels, basically.

00:38:59:35 - 00:39:26:32
不明
And that's something that is only, accessible at the moment for a visit Qatar or visit our own channels, not, for example, on TripAdvisor or Booking.com. So this content is really proprietary for us. As I've shown it has grounded really an extensive research just to ensure that, you know, we offer the right features to the customers and design it in the right way for them to to really use it.

00:39:26:37 - 00:39:54:50
不明
And, since its launch, basically it has already helped customers in more than 1 million interactions, which I think is, showing the great engagement and a great adoption of, our visitors and potential visitors. We see it and our success metrics as well, which are quite impressive. So, with the launch, we noticed that, we have a six times higher engagement rate for somebody that is using the icon.

00:39:54:55 - 00:40:23:52
不明
Let me say, they are six times more likely to engage, visitors that use their concessionaire on our channels are four times, spent four times more time on the site itself on our website. And are really interacting with the content. So they are not, not only interacting with the, concierge itself, but they are going really deeper into the, other areas of the website.

00:40:23:57 - 00:40:34:58
不明
And in total visits, on average visit more than three times per pages than somebody who doesn't use the concierge.

00:40:35:02 - 00:40:58:49
不明
Okay. For us, it's a journey. So just to give a little bit of an outlook, what what we have, what kind of other plans we have, next for this product and maybe other related products. We are going to move into, identical, of course, without telling, too much about that. There's one other area that is of particular interest to us.

00:40:58:49 - 00:41:25:26
不明
And, I think Dallas has alluded to that earlier, because we also aggregate a lot of content. We don't only own the content, but we aggregate it, which comes with its own challenges. Regarding QA in particular regarding the, the quality assurance of that content, we are looking very much forward to leverage, better workflows in our content supply and, and, and leverage actually AI powered workflows in that regard.

00:41:25:31 - 00:41:57:35
不明
All of that, in particular the concierge. But any other experience on our website and our app and our in destination experience is based on the data that we feed into it. So that's a continuous focus for us as well, to continuously evolve, clean, structure that data, our own data and the data of our partners that we get, and the last one is that, while we have rolled out our experience across multiple channels already, the different channels have different maturity levels.

00:41:57:35 - 00:42:27:43
不明
And that's something that we want to, yeah, align as well as for the channels that's going to catch up, a little bit of something we want to push. And we also are rolling out in other channels, including, WhatsApp, very particularly. And just to summarize some of the key takeaways from what we presented. So the travel industry, as we've introduced with, is, becoming open for innovation, which I'm quite pleased about.

00:42:27:48 - 00:42:49:08
不明
I think everybody in that industry should be prepared for that, regardless of the size of their teams. Tooling is very important because it builds the foundation to enable your teams. But it's not the only thing that is important. So it's really about building, the team structures and interactions and processes that, enable your teams actually to use the tools in the right way.

00:42:49:08 - 00:43:13:40
不明
And we saw a few examples in terms of what has worked for me. In the past. One recommendation has always one of the important things is to take learnings. And for learnings you need to test, you need to, experiment and you need to get the data in in order to get that fast. Usually it helps if you leverage the time window where you have a lot of traffic.

00:43:13:45 - 00:43:44:30
不明
That can be campaigns or certainties or narratives, which also means that you need to work backwards from those, time windows. And last but not least, I think, yeah, it's often about just taking the leap and not waiting for the perfect setup, but allow actually your platform to grow with the maturity of your team. So this is one of the paths on how to use existing tools to create something a little bit more innovative.

00:43:44:30 - 00:43:58:01
不明
Some of the examples, so I'm happy to connect after the session, during the summit, on LinkedIn, whatever. And also open to take any questions. Right now if you have them. Thank you.
