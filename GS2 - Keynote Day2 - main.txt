Thank you Rachel. Hello everyone, and thank you for being here this morning. In yesterday's keynote, Shantanu and Anil describe the Adobe AI platform where data models and ultimately agents support all your marketing productivity and creativity endeavors. Now that technology comes to life in Adobe Experience platform and all its associated applications, really unleashing agent AI to deliver unified customer experiences.

00:00:41:23 - 00:01:16:19
不明
Now, last year, we introduced the AI assistant. It's a technology that allows you to use natural language, to seek insights from your customer experience data going forward. We are supercharging the AI assistant with agents. So I'll spend a few minutes describing what are agents. Well, to start with, they are powerful software artifacts that are both intelligent and autonomous.

00:01:16:21 - 00:01:51:08
不明
You continue to engage with them through conversations, but they go beyond answering questions. They can actually do things for you. I mean, you have to tell them, what do you want? What are your goals? What are your constraints? And then they get to work often in the background, and they'll proactively make suggestions, filling in gaps. And it turns out that Adobe Experience, platform applications are a natural fit for such agents.

00:01:51:11 - 00:02:24:02
不明
So sure enough, we are tightly integrating them into all your favorite applications, like the real time CDP, Adobe Journey Optimizer, Customer Journey Analytics, and Adobe Experience Manager. Now all of these capabilities will be surfaced through the AI assistant. So thereby you have a uniform interface across the board. Behind the scenes, the AI agent orchestrator will manage all these agents for you.

00:02:24:04 - 00:02:51:22
不明
So maybe let's take a look at a few of the agents that are on their way. The first is the audience agent. So as the name suggests, this is your ally when it comes to audiences. And it is tightly interwoven into real time CDP. And while the familiar air assistant interface, you will now be able to create and manage audiences.

00:02:51:24 - 00:03:30:23
不明
So let's take an example of an online travel website and say an audience specialist goal is to increase garden tools through cross-sell. The specialist can ask the AI agent to find customers with flights, cruise or hotel bookings in the next six months and then filter the ones that have a higher propensity to add got into. So if you see that the directives are pretty simple, that the practitioners are providing to the assistant.

00:03:30:26 - 00:04:13:16
不明
But what happens behind the scenes is a lot more complex. Now the agent begins by analyzing your stated goals and constraints. It reasons about your intentions, and then it generates an orchestration plan, picking up relevant, attributes and events from unified profiles. It may even build some descriptive and predictive models on the fly to estimate audience sizes. And eventually the agent explains the plan to the practitioner, seeks adjustments, and then based on your feedback, it can update the plan and then go into action.

00:04:13:19 - 00:04:55:07
不明
So in effect, you as a practitioner are specifying what you want, and the agent focuses on the how. And of course, all of this is managed by the agent orchestrator. Behind the scenes. So next up is the journey agent. Now this is embedded within Adobe Journey Optimizer. So just like the audience agent, this also accepts your directives in natural language to create and manage journeys so it can handle, you know, basic things like, hey, what are my top performing journeys?

00:04:55:09 - 00:05:28:15
不明
Or stop all upsell journeys? But it does go further than that. So if you take travel and hospitality, you know it's an industry with loyalty. Tiers like gold, silver, platinum. And when customers risk losing status, brands have to bring them back into the fold. So how do you incentivize them to kind of stay on track? That's the goal is and the constraint is that, you know, loyalty programs run on an annual cycle.

00:05:28:17 - 00:05:57:07
不明
So when this problem why are these goals and constraints is proposed, I stated to the agent it will design a journey to entice certain customers that could go that are off track with relevant offers. It will look up the past travel behavior. It will look up their loyalty status. It will combine that with industry knowledge as well as with brand requirements.

00:05:57:09 - 00:06:27:03
不明
And then it will recommend when and how to nudge customers. Deciding on the right offers the timing as well as the channels. Now these recommendations with explanations will be presented to the practitioner and they can refine them iteratively. So I think you will see a pattern here that you are always in the driver's seat. And you have an autopilot that you can switch on.

00:06:27:05 - 00:07:02:23
不明
So now that you've built your audiences and crafted what you think are the perfect journeys, that's awesome. But we know that experimentation and marketing is an always on exercise. As, customers change or, you know, markets evolve. You want the ability to play with new ideas. And to that end, we are building the experimentation agent. Now the experimentation agent, it lets you quickly cycle through ideas, deploying the ones that prove effective.

00:07:02:25 - 00:07:39:12
不明
So again, let's take an example. Say you want to increase the new subscriber engagement. You present this to the agent. In turn it gathers insights from your customer experience data as well as prior experiments. And they'll generate multiple ideas or hypotheses. It even predicts results for each hypothesis. So let's say one suggestion that the the agent makes is to incentivize subscribers with small rewards for completing certain tasks.

00:07:39:15 - 00:08:09:10
不明
You like the expected lift. You choose to run that experiment. And at the end of which, it's going to summarize the results in a way that are pretty easy to comprehend. So at that point, based on real world validation, you can either productize that experiment or you can continue to iterate further. So with that, let's look at how maybe it is using agents to enhance their Bonvoy guest experiences.

00:08:09:13 - 00:08:21:04
不明
With me on stage. I have Rachel in our senior Product Manager for generative AI. Over to you, Rachel. Thanks so much, Andrew.

00:08:21:06 - 00:08:46:01
不明
I'm excited to show you all a host of new capabilities that are coming to Adobe Experience Cloud that will help brands deliver unified and even more personalized consumer experiences across all touchpoints. Before we get started, I'd like to thank Marriott for allowing us to use their brand for this vision demo, and all data and workflows that I show are fictitious.

00:08:46:03 - 00:09:17:03
不明
To protect the privacy of Marriott guests. Now, Marriott business travelers are really as loyal as any in the hospitality industry. And empowered by new Adobe capabilities, they're finding smarter ways to inspire Bonvoy business travelers to extend their trips. I mean, how many of you all are sticking around in Vegas after Summit? All right. A couple of you. Well, let me show you a glimpse of the experience that Marriott can deliver.

00:09:17:06 - 00:09:45:16
不明
I've just finished booking a work trip to Las Vegas. After booking, I receive a notification to extend my stay. Now I'm just thinking business right now, so I'll swipe it away. But later, when I'm in my confirmation email, I notice that there's an opportunity for a points bonus if I extend my trip to when I tap through. I see discounts on local Vegas activities.

00:09:45:16 - 00:10:18:05
不明
And what is that, a discounted helicopter tour? I'm going to extend my trip with this activity. And now I'm all set for my Vegas work trip. Now that Marriott upsell experience was delivered to guests at scale, leveraging several new Adobe capabilities, why don't we check in to see how we put it together? I'll start by finding the right audience to target for my goal of extended business trips.

00:10:18:07 - 00:10:46:10
不明
I'll do this using audience agent, a new goal oriented way for practitioners to create and refined audiences. An Adobe Experience platform. I'll start by asking audience agent through AI assistant to help me expand my extended stay plan with additional audiences. It looks like Audience Agent came up with three audiences based on my goal and looking a bit more closely.

00:10:46:17 - 00:11:18:06
不明
Luxury travelers will play really well for this campaign, so I'll add that to my plan. Once I'm on the canvas, I can actually simulate engagement across the different channels using machine learning on the fly. And it looks like I have a pretty good opportunity for email promotion. I'll definitely be capitalizing on that later. Last, I'll optimize my audience just by focusing on profiles that have a high propensity to convert.

00:11:18:08 - 00:11:45:24
不明
And with that, I just got a pretty sweet upgrade, and I didn't even have to pass by the front desk for it. Now that my audience is optimized, let's sculpt the journey that these business travelers are on. Rather than starting from a blank slate. I'll just prompt AI assistant to create a journey to incentivize business travelers to extend their trip to include leisure time.

00:11:45:26 - 00:12:19:15
不明
Now, AI assistant is using past journey performance data as a reference to help me come up with some basics for my use case. It even identified the two audiences that I just optimized. I'll indicate further that I need a FOMO inducing push notification, a personalized confirmation email, and discounts on local activities. Fantastic. That saved me a lot of time with just a few short prompts to AI assistant.

00:12:19:18 - 00:12:47:08
不明
I was able to publish a draft of my journey all the way to the canvas. Easier than room service. Okay, but we're not done yet. We now need to continuously optimize the journey that these business travelers are on. Using experimentation. And to do this, I'll use experimentation. Agent. Now, the metric that I'm trying to move is booking extensions.

00:12:47:10 - 00:13:14:27
不明
It looks like experimentation agent has already come up with a pretty promising hypothesis for me that promoting discounted excursions instead of a points bonus will drive more booking extensions. Using this information, I can add an additional treatment to my journey and then based on simulated performance, I'll either roll this experience out to everyone or I'll go back and find another hypothesis to test.

00:13:14:29 - 00:13:28:18
不明
But for now, I'm ready to pack my bags and go back to you. Angel. Thank you. Rating. That was awesome.

00:13:28:21 - 00:13:54:24
不明
We are truly thrilled by the uptake of our AI capabilities on the AI assistant. An overwhelming number of you have adopted it, and we've heard from you that you are seeing significant productivity gains. Here is a quote, from a customer that is quite representative of what we are hearing. Yeah, assistant has saved us hours troubleshooting data journey and audience management.

00:13:54:27 - 00:14:28:07
不明
Even on agents, the early feedback has been equally promising. We've seen great success at triple an artist. They saw 165% increase in car rentals, while targeting just a fraction of their prior audience sizes. So in this case, less is more. Wegmans. They also saw three x higher engagement rates using AI powered audiences for mobile campaigns.

00:14:28:09 - 00:15:05:02
不明
Now, just as marketing practitioners have the AI assistant, your brand customers will also soon have a similar technology at their fingertips. And we are calling this the Adobe Brand Concierge. Now, we are all familiar with the power of commodity LMS. At Adobe, we are taking this technology a step further. Brand concierge is really the fusion of generative AI with customer profiles and your brand's asset portfolio.

00:15:05:04 - 00:15:53:04
不明
So much like the assistant, this is also conversational. It's multimodal. It has insights into your customer's buying patterns and preferences. And it also knows about your brand's offerings. It knows about, you know, the inventories of products and other assets. So all of this really allows for personalized engagement and decision making. No more generic answers from commodity LMS. So when my daughter goes online shopping for Tops, the brand concierge can recommend the colors and styles that match the bands she bought in-store a few weeks back.

00:15:53:06 - 00:16:22:15
不明
So see what I just did there? Now, if my daughter hears this, she would want all her favorite brands to have the brand concierge. Now over to Rachel to see this in action. Thanks so much, Andrea. So many of Marriott's premium properties can offer a personalized concierge experience in the lobbies of their hotels. But that type of experience isn't really scalable across all hotels in their portfolio.

00:16:22:17 - 00:16:51:04
不明
Or is it if done digitally? Jump ahead with me to the last day of the conference. I've now shifted from business to leisure mode, and actually sunglasses helped a lot with the bright lights at the end of the conference. I receive a push notification about a celebrity chef dining experience. And can I just say I love that Marriott knows that I'm a foodie.

00:16:51:06 - 00:17:24:18
不明
It's in my consumer profile. When I tap through, I enter a multimodal conversational experience that's powered by Adobe Brand Concierge. And will you look at these brand assets? There is nothing generic about this experience. It looks like the dinner is tonight at Marriott's partner, Cosmopolitan Hotel. Let's get a little bit more information about it. Can you tell me more about the chef?

00:17:24:20 - 00:17:59:06
不明
Okay. This looks fun. I have to meet this guy. Let's book an 8 p.m. reservation for four tonight. Anyone want to come with me? Great. Well, Marriott was able to confirm my reservation instantly by linking me to a booking agent that's linked to Adobe Commerce. Well, back at Marriott, with Brand Concierge deployed to over 9000 properties, they need a really simple way to analyze across all of the guest interactions.

00:17:59:09 - 00:18:33:10
不明
Bill of course do this using Adobe Customer Journey Analytics. New data insights agent. I'll simply ask AI assistant, analyze brand concierge requests. This is looking across all 9000 properties. I can even filter down just by business travelers. Seems like everyone's really interested in these experiences. Last you may have noticed this Real-Time refresh button at the top. And yes, it does exactly what you were hoping it does.

00:18:33:12 - 00:19:08:11
不明
When I select this all data and visualizations update to show in real time, there's no better way to get a pulse on what's happening right now across your entire consumer experience. All right. Well, it's time for me to turn in my key card and check out. Back to you, angel. Fantastic. Thank you. Rachel. The. Thank you. So, in addition to the brand concierge, what you also saw is the evolution of analytics.

00:19:08:13 - 00:19:42:10
不明
Conversations are the new way that both the marketers and decision makers, they draw insights from data. And as you heard that the data insights agent is enabling that shift. Now it certainly covers your basic scenarios like, you know, what's my revenue by product category this month or in a certain region? But it really shines with sophisticated capabilities such as forecasting, anomaly detection, causal analysis, and remediation.

00:19:42:13 - 00:20:16:03
不明
So to give you one example of its power, it can compare audiences against stated goals and explain what are the potential reasons for any of the differences across this. Now, these are difficult things to do without this kind of a technology available to you. Now, this kind of an analysis can be applied to whether it's a purchase, customer onboarding or order fulfillment finance and really enable your teams to take action quickly.

00:20:16:05 - 00:20:55:15
不明
So I'm sure you can appreciate how AI is transforming marketing. This technology will allow you to create more personalized and impactful customer experiences. We really look forward to seeing how you will leverage these innovations through our applications to drive unified customer experience. Thank you so much for your great partnership. And now I have the pleasure of welcoming Hillary Coke, Vice President, Global Marketing Operations, Acme at Hillary, who's amazing story.

00:20:55:17 - 00:21:32:03
不明
Now, over the last two days, we've heard a lot about personalization at scale in the age of AI and much of what we've shared has been in the service of consumer brands. But we have thousands of B2B customers who also rely on Adobe technology. So to tell us more, let's welcome Amita Huia, our senior vice president of product.

00:21:32:05 - 00:21:52:19
不明
All right. You. Woo! Thank you. I like that. Thank you. Angel. How great was Hillary? She can hear you. Yeah. Let's let let's let's give it up for Hillary. That was, that was absolutely incredible. And I loved her telling the story, and I thought that was amazing. All right. We're going to switch gears. Rachel talked about it, and they'll talk about it.

00:21:52:21 - 00:22:11:17
不明
B2B this is an area we have continue to invest very, very heavily in. We're incredibly excited about the announcements we're about to share with you. But before we even go into it, let me just set a little bit of context. Number one is we understand B2B is different than B2C. Let me just start there. We understand the foundations are different.

00:22:11:21 - 00:22:35:19
不明
We understand the needs are different, the pain points are different. And we have been focusing very much on how do we truly take this to the next level. And we also understand the complexity of B2B is going up from a journey point of view, different channels. Everyone's coming in through different spots. So all this complexity is rising, and we fundamentally think we're on the precipice of a different era of B2B.

00:22:35:21 - 00:22:57:13
不明
I want to show you what I mean by that. So here's our view of the evolution and where the opportunity really lies. If you rewind the clock, rewind, rewind, rewind a ways back, there was B2B 1.0. It was basically digitizing the customer record. I'm going to bring this manual records. Deterministic people enter stuff. Incredibly important, incredibly important for B2B.

00:22:57:16 - 00:23:14:29
不明
Right. But it was largely kind of more sales oriented and it was really deterministic and manual enter about 4 or 5 years ago, maybe B2B 2.0. So a lot of companies have said, hey, this isn't working for me. I'm going to go do more account based stuff. So enter ABM. But the problem there, it was just top of the funnel.

00:23:15:02 - 00:23:33:12
不明
Right. And everybody started looking at B2B is more than just top of the funnel. This is where I truly believe we are at different stage and we call it B2B 3.0, which is all about AI orchestrated journeys. Fancy name I know. What the heck do I mean by it? Let me tell you four things that I mean by it.

00:23:33:15 - 00:23:51:26
不明
Number one, B2B is not just about marketing. It's not just about sales. It's not just about top of the funnel. It is about the whole funnel. How do you bring these teams together? What sales, marketing, customer service, how do you orchestrate? So number one full funnel. Number two, it's not enough just to have lead or account. It is both.

00:23:51:29 - 00:24:11:22
不明
There will be lead flows that come in. There will be account flows. How do you understand both and orchestrate against those. Number three how are you proactive learning where those accounts are in their journey. And this is the problem we see with so many customers today. They're like, I don't know, I'm getting this from this sales rep, this marketing outreach.

00:24:11:28 - 00:24:34:10
不明
How do you fundamentally have a view, a single view of where that account is in the buying group and through the journey? And lastly, how do you fundamentally do real time optimization predicated on where they are? That is B2B 3.0. We are incredibly excited today to announce integrated B2B go to market orchestration. I know you're sitting here saying, okay, what is it?

00:24:34:13 - 00:24:56:17
不明
We're going to show it to you. We're going to walk step by step, but there's three parts of this that I want everybody to understand as we walk through each chapter. Number one, the data foundation. It starts with data. B2B is different. It's fundamentally different B2C in many ways. And you have to have your data foundation correct. Number two, if you have your data foundation, they want personalization to same as B2C, but it's different.

00:24:56:20 - 00:25:15:16
不明
You have different types of content. We're going to walk you through what personalization looks like in the future of B2B. And number three, as I talked earlier about how you see this real time engagement, how do you take insights to action? And most importantly, I want to leave you with one big thing. As you see, the demo that I'm about to walk through, it has to be on the same platform.

00:25:15:18 - 00:25:31:17
不明
And yesterday you saw so much around Adobe Experience Platform, but this is the investment we've been making. How do we continue to put B2B as a first class is and built on a platform so you can do these things natively. But again, let's show it to you. That's the goal of today. So Amy is here going to do an amazing job of this.

00:25:31:17 - 00:25:47:06
不明
And we're going to start. Let me tee it up first. We're going to start with what I started chapter one the Data Foundation. It starts with a notion of what is an account and what is a buying group. And from there this notion of hey, I'm a marketer, where do I actually see this real time view? So Amy, over to you.

00:25:47:08 - 00:26:11:23
不明
Thanks, Tim. It. I'm so excited to show you how Adobe is reimagining the way businesses orchestrate. They go to market machines, fundamentally improving how they plan, create, engage, and measure with AI powered experiences. But first, I'd like to thank ServiceNow for allowing us to use their brand to showcase in our innovations today, and to let you know the data you'll see is fictitious.

00:26:11:26 - 00:26:37:06
不明
So as a marketer at ServiceNow, I'm looking to cross-sell my HR service delivery into my existing customer base. But one of the hardest things to do when planning across sales strategy is identifying the right accounts to target, right. Well, with this new dashboard in Adobe Journey, optimize a B2B edition, ServiceNow marketing and sales teams can access a single view of their top accounts, eliminating the need to gather data from multiple sources.

00:26:37:08 - 00:27:02:03
不明
So let's take a look. So as you can see, I can quickly assess my top accounts by engagement level, and I can dive into more detail if I need to. And if I scroll down, I can quickly see what accounts are surging and those at risk, as well as buying group highlights. Now, these incredible insights help me to unlock a more precise go to market plan, and it's even easier for me to take action now.

00:27:02:05 - 00:27:25:29
不明
Using audience agent, I can quickly get started with any of these out of the box actions right here, but I want to know who to cross out to. So why don't we go ahead and ask the question? Can you recommend accounts to cross-sell HR service delivery? And let's see what it comes back with. Amazing. It's suggesting that there's 36 accounts ready to target.

00:27:26:02 - 00:27:45:13
不明
But you'll also notice it's recommending the ideal personas to form the buying groups in these accounts. Now that's pretty intelligent. And if you're wondering what a buying group is, it is the group of individuals and roles within an account that are involved in a purchase decision for a particular product or service. Now, these personas are definitely related to my buying groups.

00:27:45:16 - 00:28:04:07
不明
So let's go ahead and create them. Now that used to take hours, but with the help of audience agent, I did that in just a few moments. I mean, talk about a productivity booster. So as I'm viewing my buying groups here, I can quickly assess their status using insights such as completeness, score, and contact coverage. And again, I'm really happy with these.

00:28:04:07 - 00:28:27:15
不明
So now I just want to add them to a journey. You might notice that the agent is also recommending two of my existing journeys to add my buying groups to. Now this is definitely my cross-sell motion here, so I'm going to add them and done. I mean, being able to accurately predict accounts and operationalize buying groups with such ease is a complete game changer.

00:28:27:18 - 00:28:47:04
不明
Back to your main. Awesome. Perfect. Thank you. All right. That's just chapter one. Thank you. Amy. I was thank you for walking through that. That's chapter one. She walked you through the data foundation. How do we think about accounts? Most importantly, how do we think about this buying group concept? Layer two. So what is chapter two? Chapter two is I have my data foundation personalization.

00:28:47:06 - 00:29:04:02
不明
Again we think about it a lot in a B2C context. Same thing is true in the B2B context. And three things I want you to pay attention to as you walk through this that are requirements of B2B personalization. Number one, how are we using AI to infuse into this to truly do the personalization using the new agenda capability?

00:29:04:04 - 00:29:25:10
不明
Second, content for B2C and B2B is different, but yet you still need a supply chain. So what a lot of what we've invested into is not just the data side, but how do we bring content in from a B2B point of view to truly drive personalization? And third, what you're going to see the notion of interaction in B2B is changing as well.

00:29:25:13 - 00:29:42:13
不明
If you're a B2B buyer, you're coming in. Maybe previously you were always clicking lead forms. Even this is becoming more conversational. So when you heard about concierge, you heard about it yesterday. Angel talked about it. We are also doing this in the context of B2B, that next generation conversational experience. So let's show you this now from that point of view.

00:29:42:15 - 00:30:03:08
不明
Awesome. So let's jump into the journey. Now you'll notice that I have three unique paths delivering contextual experiences to each of my buying group members. Our first path is to target our decision makers with a paid social ad to book a meeting. Our second path is to add our HR practitioners to a journey in Marketo. Engage to view a webinar.

00:30:03:10 - 00:30:32:11
不明
And our last path is to retarget our IT influences with an email with some tips and tricks. Now we know paid social is a critical channel to engage key account stakeholders. So let's preview my ad and you might notice that it's coming from Adobe Gen Studio for performance marketing. Adobe makes it so easy to generate and activate high performing, paid social content using gen AI to automate the production workflows and data insights to create engaging experiences.

00:30:32:13 - 00:31:01:02

But I also want to preview Adobe Brand Concierge B2B edition, our new conversational platform.

Now, that is truly cutting edge. Yeah. I reckon we clap for that one too.

And as each of these interactions occur, we're updating our buying group engagement score so that once it actually reaches a desired threshold, we can automatic alert sales to progress the conversation, creating an even tighter connection between sales and marketing. Back to you. Perfect. All right. So that is the personalization layer. Oh, yeah. Please, please. That's awesome.

It's even not just about sales. The customer sales team, the customer service teams, etc. how do we take this insights and democratize that for everybody to know where these accounts are? That's part one. Part two is every part of the B2B journey needs to be measured and optimized, just like how we think about B2C today. Super excited. We're announcing the new B2B capabilities within Customer Journey Analytics.

Awesome. So let's bring the sales experience to life. So here my sales rep has received a notification that HR decision maker from a K account is not engaged.

Now account qualification agent helps to guide the rep to invite Rachel, the HR decision maker, to an event happening in Las Vegas. But it even goes as far as creating a personalized email to send to her so he can view it.

I mean, it looks awesome. So he can send I mean, how easy was that? It really is just a few taps away for account progression for our sales teams. Now, but you might be wondering how can you measure and optimize these complex journeys?

And as they scroll down, they can get more insights, such as understanding what stage each of their buying groups are in, such as qualified, who are ready for sales outreach. This totally boost sales velocity.
