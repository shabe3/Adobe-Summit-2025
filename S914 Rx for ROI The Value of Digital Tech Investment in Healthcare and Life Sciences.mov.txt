00:00:01:13 - 00:00:29:36
不明
So we're probably the last thing between you and cocktails, right? So hopefully we're going to make this, you know, somewhat engaging, somewhat entertaining and hopefully educational. Now before we get started, tradition with me at least. How many of you have been here? How many of you seen me before? Okay, that's pretty good. How many of you have actually been to.

00:00:29:42 - 00:00:55:30
不明
I mean, this is what we call the health care super session, right? And this is my eighth from when we first started in 2017. Who's been here to one of those? Anyone? Wow. True fans. I'm going to come talk to you later. Anyway, we start with a selfie, so I need everyone to stand up and, you know, ham it up for the picture.

00:00:55:35 - 00:01:00:58
不明
Or do you want us?

00:01:01:03 - 00:01:31:36
不明
To get in here. West. Oh. Thank you. That's better. There we go. All right, everybody ready? Don't fall off. One. Two. Three. Health care. All right. I didn't know what we were saying. Very close to the edge. All right. Thank you all for, indulging me. My name is Tom Swanson. I'm the head of Adobe's global health care, strategy and marketing team.

00:01:31:40 - 00:01:57:22
不明
Like I said, I've been with Adobe for eight years. Prior to that, I was an Adobe customer. Right. So this actually is my 11th summit. And yes, it is better as a customer than it is as an employee. Right. So all of you enjoy it, right? As much as you can. Today, what do I do with my thing?

00:01:57:23 - 00:02:21:46
不明
We're going to be talking about, I mean, long title, right? But what we're going to be doing, we're going to have a panel discussion with my three closest friends here where we're going to be talking about kind of how we all buy into personalization. Right. And that personalization is important, and personalization is something that we all need to do.

00:02:22:01 - 00:02:44:46
不明
So what we decided to do was kind of mix things up this year a little bit and talk more about the return on investment. Right. It's like once you've made the decision right, that we're going to undertake this journey to kind of change how we engage our customers. And you'll hear all here, all of us kind of use the term customer today intentionally, right?

00:02:44:47 - 00:03:11:46
不明
Even though we're all in health care. Right? We're not going to be talking about patients or health care professionals or or plan members or anything like that, because we think it's really important to be thinking about your customers as customers. Right. And the fact that they have a choice and that that choice is something that they're going to make kind of in the split second that they're engaging you at any particular time.

00:03:11:51 - 00:03:34:34
不明
So when we talk about customers and customer engagement, we're talking about each of you, right? How many of you raise your hand? How many of you consider yourself a health care consumer? Right. You better be all of us. Right. Because because we are in some way, right, engaged with a health care ecosystem that is providing us some product or service.

00:03:34:39 - 00:04:06:27
不明
And so what we're going to do today is talk to these three experts. And I use the term very loosely for Blaire and West, but Laura is absolutely, an expert. Right. That I'm talking about, kind of, you know, what we did to set up this panel was ask them to come up with, use case, like, what is it that you kind of determined here's an opportunity for us to use Adobe Tech to accomplish something, right?

00:04:06:27 - 00:04:27:34
不明
So I'm going to ask each of them to kind of introduce themselves, talk about or kind of list the use case that they were approaching. And then we'll we'll get into the questions. My hope, right, is that, you know, the Q&A that we do back and forth is engaging enough to get us to about 2015, 20 minutes towards the end.

00:04:27:39 - 00:04:51:21
不明
And then we've got microphones set up here for each of you to ask these expert questions. Right? Once once we get there. So with that, I'd like to introduce Blaire McCracken. Blaire share a little bit, about yourself kind of at the company or with what your role is, what your use case is. And then I'm going to ask you a surprise question, a surprise question.

00:04:51:21 - 00:05:13:12
不明
Oh, no. Hi, everybody. My name is Blaire. I work for CVS health, and I like to talk a lot, so you can tell that it's okay. Cheer. I'm already hoarse at the end of day one, and I have my fancy honey tea here to help me through the session. My role at CVS health, is, is sort of, in the white space.

00:05:13:19 - 00:05:39:36
不明
So I lead our marketing technology Center of excellence for the marketing team. And that means that I get to work with colleagues across the entire enterprise, connect dots, and figure out different ways that they're going to use the technology and help amplify all of the great work that they're doing. I also love to throw myself on various projects to try to help boost them along when I feel like they're going to give us extra value or right on.

00:05:39:36 - 00:06:08:55
不明
So what use case did you pick? So mine is a little bit different because of the nature of my role. I'm not activating use cases, leveraging the stack. And instead what I focused on over the last 12 months was creating something called the Value Scorecard. That value scorecard showcases the actual value that all of the marketers have driven using the tech, and puts that into a full dashboard that we can then use to continue to justify investing.

00:06:09:00 - 00:06:34:34
不明
As we move forward. And I felt like it was, a passion project. So I have I have lots of good ideas about how other people can do it. The only problem is it does involve math, and I'm sorry about that. How many of you, return on investment or being able to justify. Right. The investments that you make is important.

00:06:34:39 - 00:06:58:48
不明
Yeah, all of us are two hands. Right. And so awesome player. That's going to be a great topic. My surprise question for you is what zodiac sign are you? I'm a Leo that says so much. So what do you think about Mars retrograde right now, you mean? Well, I only really care about Mercury going into retrograde because that impacts the tech, you guys.

00:06:58:58 - 00:07:19:54
不明
That's right. It does. It does. It impacts the tech. Thank you. West. West is from Novo Nordisk West. Introduce yourself. Yeah. So obviously I'm not Erica Higgins. She apologizes. She can't be here today. And I did promise her, I would assure all of you that I'm in no way representing her intelligence. I'm only here to represent mine.

00:07:19:58 - 00:07:42:21
不明
So, no, don't hold anything against her. But, I've been at Novo for just under 20 years. I've held positions in brand marketing, both on the HCP side. On the patient side, I've held positions and market access. But for the last eight years, I've been in omnichannel engagement. The last four actually leading that, that team of about 25 people, you know, leveraging the martech stack to deliver customer experiences that matter.

00:07:42:25 - 00:07:58:49
不明
So it's it's been a fun ride. Experiences that matter. Okay. So what's the use case that you chose. Yeah. So I think, you know, I'll focus my responses around ADP and that, you know, customer data platform and how we're leveraging that. Okay. So the use of data when it comes to making decisions and better engaging your customers.

00:07:58:49 - 00:08:24:10
不明
Yeah, that sounds way better than right. So you've got ROI and data driven decisions. Perfect. What is a little tidbit about you that no one in here would know? Even the people that work with you, even the people that know me. Yeah. No pressure. Well, I'm a first generation American. Actually, both of my parents are, immigrants, World War two refugees.

00:08:24:10 - 00:08:47:17
不明
So my brother and I are actually, first generation Americans. From where? My mother's from Poland, my father from Germany has. Dick. That's a great story. Thank you. Man, he even surprised me. That was good. So our last but most fabulous Laura Cutler. Introduce yourself. Yeah. Hi, everyone. My name is Laura Cutler, and I'm from Johnson Johnson.

00:08:47:22 - 00:09:09:30
不明
I support our customer engagement and digital transformation team at JNJ supporting kind of all of North America. So, I've had the privilege to help support a few digital transformations in the last five years there. So the use case for today will be content supply chain to how can we really look holistically to think about how we can drive faster speed in both content creation and review.

00:09:09:30 - 00:09:35:06
不明
So excited to hone in. Fantastic. You'd actually think we kind of planned this, right? Content supply chain, operational ROI and data driven decision making. So surprise question for you. So, you know, what was it February 3rd with the Super Bowl? Were you happy or said, I'm from Philadelphia, by the way. I live downtown. Big bird stand.

00:09:35:06 - 00:09:58:13
不明
I grew up outside the city, so I have two brothers. We are huge eagles. It was amazing. I got to go to the parade. So anyone out there who is from Philly or an Eagles fan? Go, birds. Anyone who's a Chiefs fan. Sorry. All right man they've won. They won three out of the last four. That's enough for anybody.

00:09:58:13 - 00:10:24:38
不明
So it's all good. Any Kansas City fans you can go I'm a Broncos fan. So you know I hate Kansas City with a deep, deep passion. All right so let's get into the questions. And Laura, I'm going to start with you. Right. You were talking about content supply chain and kind of the first scripted question. And you guys have learned very quickly that we go off script at a moment's notice.

00:10:24:43 - 00:10:49:52
不明
How do you identify, right, the business opportunity that you saw. Right. You're like, okay, we have this need, and Adobe is a good partner to help us satisfy this need. And then how did you get leadership on board? Right in order to actually undertake the project that you did? Yeah. So it's great question. I think in my experience, you need both bottoms up and top down.

00:10:49:57 - 00:11:10:27
不明
To really get the buy in and to get that activation kind of across the enterprise. So when we are tackling the content supply chain, we actually took one brand and looked at how can we really problem solve for this one brand. We looked at all the cross-functional kind of stakeholders involved our marketers, our viewers, our agency partners, and figured out each of their unique pain points.

00:11:10:31 - 00:11:33:23
不明
That then led us to think about how what we need in terms of process and change management, and then how we can bring technology and accelerators to help support that. So we started with one brand. We were able to show the value, with the new technology within three months. And that was we then were able to take to our executive committee, where we were able to get buy in for full enterprise wide scale.

00:11:33:23 - 00:11:53:22
不明
So that's where I think we took, kind of an idea of one brand to then full scale as opposed to maybe one after the other. And I think the reason for that of the value, that I saw was technology is always changing. So if you take it one brand at a time, it could take, 18 brands, it could take years.

00:11:53:34 - 00:12:10:03
不明
So you have to get to that scale quickly to be able to really see the value and the impact that you'll get back for your enterprise. So, that really is kind of the the bottoms up approach of how it can work, the impact that it could bring to the business, but then taking it to that executive level for a top down push across all brands.

00:12:10:08 - 00:12:32:22
不明
Well, what I really like about that, Laura, is, I mean, you kind of approached it from a bite size perspective, right? Because I know a lot of times when, you know, as a health care organization, you're like, oh my gosh, we have to do a better job of engaging our customers, right? And giving them kind of the content that they want.

00:12:32:22 - 00:12:57:05
不明
At the time that they're choosing to engage us. That can be incredibly daunting, right? And it's always the question that we at Adobe always get is, where do we start? Right. So in the fact that you kind of said, all right, we're going to do one brand, we're going to focus on that. And then once we actually have some wins, that's when we're going to take it to leadership.

00:12:57:06 - 00:13:21:15
不明
Exactly. That was great. So Wes, same question for you. Right. So when you were talking about how do we use the data to better engage our customers, you know, how did you start that project and how did you get leadership by it? Yeah. So, you know, I think for us, you know, I would actually go back to the beginning and it started with the vision of what omnichannel was going to be at Novo Nordisk.

00:13:21:19 - 00:13:47:13
不明
And when, you know, we got to the point where ADP came out and came up as a conversation, you know, I kind of framed it as like, you know, the technology has caught up with this strategy, like what we've wanted to do, what we've been aspiring to do with what we had. This technology, you know, will allow us to now, you know, put that in the market at scale to use all that data that we've been collecting, to really better understand our customers, and be much more intentional with what we're putting out in the market to deliver that customer experience.

00:13:47:13 - 00:14:05:22
不明
And so I think the, the, the buying of the original vision of omnichannel put us on a path of success that it wasn't really, hurdles to get executive leadership. But with each new investment, it was building on this vision and this overall idea we're going to go to. And we saw value along the way. So this kind of next iteration, it made sense, right.

00:14:05:22 - 00:14:20:51
不明
You know, we talked about what we wanted to do with our customers, how this technology will actually accelerate that, and do it much better, much more efficiently at scale to deliver the value we were looking for. Yes. We still had to do a business case and get that all sold in. But you know, it wasn't a surprise.

00:14:20:51 - 00:14:36:55
不明
It was like, okay, this makes sense. We're building on the original vision. We're getting closer to, you know, a true omnichannel experience. And, and we had that support to kind of carry through with our brands and all that, that we're doing this. But we had the door. Let me dig a little deeper into that question. And this is officially where we go off script.

00:14:36:55 - 00:15:11:49
不明
Right. So he's going to be surprised. I mean, I have a question too. So fast it no, no no no, ask your question. Okay. Well, my first question is how long did it take you to get the organization to agree on what omnichannel meant? A great question. When we get there, I was, you know, you and what you know, because there are some days where, I do wonder I think a lot of people hear Omni, they think digital, they don't even include the field force, but, but we're working towards it.

00:15:11:54 - 00:15:30:05
不明
Depends on the day. I'm glad. It makes me feel less alone in the world. We actually had someone say, well, I need that omnichannel tactic. As if it was one tactic in a plan. I was like, you know, you need to invite me to the next meeting because I think we need to guide that person before it goes too far down the road.

00:15:30:05 - 00:15:57:01
不明
Yeah, I do a lot of are you sure it's omnichannel and it's not just multichannel? Well, so what's the difference? Blaire now is the one to all of the channels okay. As opposed to multi meaning just a few couple could start with a couple and then land and expand. Okay. But I do think that it's very important to make sure that you have your nomenclature straight before you go into these conversations as well.

00:15:57:01 - 00:16:23:29
不明
Yeah. Because everything means something different to someone else. Well, the nomenclature is what drives expectations is to, you know, whether you're successful or not. So so I want to go back to you for my question. Right. Because you were talking about utilizing data, right? To kind of better understand your customers and address your customers. What were the data sources that you chose to use?

00:16:23:29 - 00:16:50:43
不明
I mean, were you focused just kind of on the the legacy kind of B to B, the way pharma sells direct to hospitals or to the health care providers? Or were you also interested in building that kind of direct to consumer bridge as well? I mean, both are on the table. I think the ability for pharma to go direct to consumer, you know, leveraging data is a bit more challenging, especially with ever changing privacy laws.

00:16:50:43 - 00:17:05:50
不明
And, you know, what is the point of consent? What are they consenting to and how we use that data? But it's certainly part of the exploration on, you know, the health care professional, you know, side of the business. You know, we use all the data that we have available. So you know, we talked about omnichannel. What is the field force data.

00:17:05:50 - 00:17:26:15
不明
What is the prescription data. You know what is their engagement data across media. And you and how are we leverage that to create that better experience. Because, you know, something like, well, we're using data to create segmentation. I was like, I'm like, yeah, but with this, when that customer potentially changes segment because of effective marketing and messaging, we can capture that and pivot messaging to make it a more personalized experience.

00:17:26:15 - 00:17:51:22
不明
And I you know, I think that's where we're using data to really, you know, drive that because our customers are expecting it. And quite frankly, I think they deserve to get that experience. Yeah. No. And the expectation right, of personalization is I mean, it's ubiquitous right? At this point, every single one of us as consumers, I mean, Amazon ruined online engagement for all of us, right?

00:17:51:27 - 00:18:13:53
不明
Where it's just an expectation now that it's you're going to know me, you're going to respect me, right? You're going to understand where I am in my journey with you, and you're not going to waste my time, right? By showing me things that are not of particular interest to me and for health care organizations. Right. That's a significant challenge, right?

00:18:13:53 - 00:18:50:27
不明
When you're weighing the fact that we are awash in data, right? Both for and non high. And it's like, what can you use when in order to meet the expectations of your customers? I mean, that's the challenge that we all face. So now I think you brought up, I just want to add, because I think it was interesting around I think in the last five years, pharma has now started to not only kind of compete with each other when it comes to personalize engagements, but our customers are used to those experiences of Amazon, Google, that are very targeted in that they can get that personalized experience.

00:18:50:27 - 00:19:10:53
不明
And so now we're having to solve very quickly to figure out how can we reach our customers with relevant content at the right time. So I feel like very quickly, healthcare in general had to basically jump to now have omnichannel. However we may define it, but also that personalized experience because it's it's what our customers expect. Oh, and to do personalization within the context of us.

00:19:11:00 - 00:19:32:39
不明
Exactly. Right. I mean, that's been our biggest challenge, is really figuring out what can we put out into the unauthenticated space. And it's very limited because we need to be very respectful and very careful and very risk averse. So I think we actually were having a whole bonding session on this while you were running to get your hot oh.

00:19:32:43 - 00:19:53:04
不明
Well keep going. I want to hear I want to hear what you bonded over. I think it's just that we need to find better ways of bringing privacy and legal into the conversation earlier, so that we can streamline the process and get firmer guidelines. They have a desire to be very subjective and, like, look at every single use case individually, and I understand that.

00:19:53:04 - 00:20:13:45
不明
But that's not scalable for a small, you know, marketing team. So if you're trying to stay small and nimble, you can have your folks putting out stuff that's never going to go live because privacy is just going to kill it. So it's better, you know, to figure out streamlined processes where we can partner together, then continue sort of rolling the the giant rock up the hill.

00:20:13:49 - 00:20:35:17
不明
Okay. So I'm going to go to you with our next question kind of building off of that. But before we do, how many of you is your privacy and legal teams kind of the biggest hurdles, right, that you face as Mark? I didn't hit that. Come on. It's okay. Who in here is actually part of privacy and legal?

00:20:35:22 - 00:21:12:45
不明
Oh. All right. One person in the back I don't don't feel picked on at all. So Blair, the the next question I have is, you know, you mentioned I love the fact that you kind of brought up bringing legal or privacy, the regulatory and compliance team kind of into the conversation. So when you were undertaking your project of, you know, not only are we going to deploy this technology, right, and try to generate a tangible ROI to it, what did the team that you had to assemble look like?

00:21:12:50 - 00:21:33:56
不明
Well, first of all, we had a slightly different scenario. And we talked about this actually on a call a couple of weeks ago, our leadership actually secured the contract and then told us to figure out how to use it. All right. So it was very top down. And we had a huge variance of sophistication across the organization in terms of understanding how to use martech.

00:21:34:01 - 00:21:56:08
不明
What you could do, what you couldn't do. Legal and privacy was in the mix as well. And when we formed the Center of Excellence, we actually created sort of a group of super friends. And it's a lot of people who were very passionate and excited and love martech. A lot of ops folks and ops folks love process, which is the best thing about them.

00:21:56:13 - 00:22:27:40
不明
So we brought everybody together and we quickly assessed a number of challenges. I'll put it that way. To really moving adoption forward at a very rapid rate. And there was change management and there was training and there was upskilling and there was privacy and legal. And work front has actually been a huge part of our success in terms of moving that process forward, because we have gradually gotten our privacy and legal folks into work front to help with that content supply chain and transparency around approvals.

00:22:27:45 - 00:22:52:32
不明
But there's still a lot of work to be done. You know, they want to partner with the business, but they also only have so many resources. So we just have to figure out more and better ways to communicate. And the reason actually goes back to my original use case of the value scorecard is that if your privacy legal team is inhibiting your ability to even use the tech, you have to think about your investment.

00:22:52:37 - 00:23:14:25
不明
You just do. Or you have to shift the tools into the space where they can shine. So I think it's just important to really have realistic conversations around, you know, what you're spending, what you're spending it on, can you use it the way that you want to? And if you can, make sure you put it in the spot where it can make the most value happen, you and my brain.

00:23:14:27 - 00:23:51:48
不明
I know this is a journey. Yeah, well, but, I mean, you brought up something that I think is is interesting, right? In that you kind of had a mandate from leadership, right, where leadership bought into the Adobe Vision and they're like, this is our partner, this is our technology. Figure out how to make it work. So how much did that leadership mandate kind of change legal or the, collaboration between IT and marketing, which is often very adversarial, right?

00:23:51:48 - 00:24:06:43
不明
I mean, so you had all of these teams, right? Kind of forced to work together. Right? Because leadership said, thou shalt do this. How did that work?

00:24:06:48 - 00:24:31:34
不明
Have some more, yeah, that's a good idea. Well, it's been a journey, I would say. We started with cross-functional groups attached to, like, content or data or messaging. Right. And our first goal was really to get over the finish line in terms of consolidation, because I'm sure if any of you work in a large organization, you know, that new tools pop up like weeds.

00:24:31:39 - 00:24:54:22
不明
You know, somebody bought a dam or somebody went to, you know, I don't know, they set up a website with a vendor and you have no idea where it came from. So we had to consolidate onto the correct platforms first. And we had a really amazing technical partnership with our martech team. So they were in it with us, and they had sort of an if you build it, they will come.

00:24:54:27 - 00:25:13:52
不明
So they were building hard and then the rest of the ops folks and I were out selling and figuring out what the strategy and the roadmap look like. And then all at the same time, we were pushing people into the Adobe Learning Services catalog. Go take the work front class, go take the Adobe Analytics class, you know, go get certified on Adobe Experience platform.

00:25:13:57 - 00:25:33:06
不明
And by doing that, we gradually sort of skunkworks together a really good roadmap. And I think the thing that kills me is that we never look back. I don't know how many of you guys experienced this, but like, we're so focused on getting to the next milestone that we'll be like, oh, we set up the Enterprise Jam on February 9th.

00:25:33:10 - 00:25:50:13
不明
That's great. What's next? And that's like a huge accomplishment. And we should be celebrating these things and celebrating the folks that are in the trenches, like getting them over the line. And we don't spend enough time doing that in a transformational environment. And that's the problem with the top down is that you're like, oh God, we're in a hurry.

00:25:50:18 - 00:26:24:48
不明
Yeah. No, that's that's really good. And Laura, I got a question for you kind of spinning off of what? Blaire just said, right. Which is, I mean, obviously you assembled the team, right? In order to do your one brand approach to your project. And, you know, you kind of did you have all the same components, like, you had it, you had marketing, you had leadership, you had legal and privacy.

00:26:24:48 - 00:26:51:37
不明
Right? How much of an effort was spent on change management? Right. Because when you're kind of changing the way you engage your customers, you're introducing new technology. I mean, not only is that about learning new things, but I mean, that's a cultural change as well. So let's talk about change management. So change management is the hardest part of any transformation.

00:26:51:37 - 00:27:21:48
不明
I think everyone in this room knows that, whoever says this technology or some other aspect, it's change management. When I think about and not so the pilot, but more at the enterprise level, I think how we've seen success is looking at all those different stakeholders involved, and we have brought in making sure it all of our marketers, all of our 40 plus agency partners, all of our review teams, so our MLR team and our moderators, and we brought everyone together to really think through what are our goals and how can we have aligned incentives?

00:27:21:48 - 00:27:47:19
不明
I think that's what has driven us to have success when it comes to process changes and change management, how can we ensure that our agency partners and our reviewers both want to drive faster speed to market? How can we make sure that we're all trying to get the same goal? And business objective, whether it's through goals and objectives, whether it's actually changing, how they're incentivized, how it's whether it's putting into contracts through procurement.

00:27:47:24 - 00:28:09:48
不明
I think there's really the foundational aspect of change management is figuring out what do each of those teams want out of it, and how can you then bring them together to solve for it. So that's how I think we've brought in teams. I think the reviewers are one that we've spent a lot of time with. We've actually brought in senior review leaders that we started to think through and talk about some of the challenges they have.

00:28:09:48 - 00:28:31:48
不明
Why, we may be a little bit more conservative and hear their concerns with some transformations and try to get them to feel more comfortable. So as a result, came up with some standardization, created templates that our reviewers were aligned to for each channel that are across all brand. So now each brands aren't siloed and have nuances. It's standard templates that all reviewers can sign off on.

00:28:31:48 - 00:28:59:20
不明
So now agency partners know how to create content within these guidelines, and our reviewers know what to expect. So things like that of bringing teams aligning on their own to pull some of the risk off of our MLR partners was just one way we were able to drive this kind of process from change management. No. That's great. Laura and I 100% completely agree, right, that the picking the technology because, I mean, the technology exists right.

00:28:59:20 - 00:29:24:36
不明
To do all of the things that we want to do regarding consolidation of data. Right. And then performance of analytics on that data, right, to understand your customers and then in real time, being able to use that data to determine what content gets served up, when and where. Multichannel, omnichannel, whatever it is, right that tech exists, it's okay.

00:29:24:36 - 00:29:52:52
不明
You made the decision to invest in it. It's like, now how are we actually going to get value out of it, and how are we going to manage that change accordingly? I completely agree. So Wes, let's talk about roadblocks. Right. So when you decided to undertake this data consolidation and kind of using the data in a more proactive way, what was like the biggest roadblock that you ran into?

00:29:52:57 - 00:30:09:30
不明
Oh, I mean, one, I kind of want to build on what was said about change of magic is one thing that's I wouldn't call this a roadblock, but it's related in that, you know, we talk about omni channel. I think sometimes even I've not done the change management necessary for omni channel. So you're bringing this new technology and like, hey, we're all on board with this.

00:30:09:30 - 00:30:29:25
不明
So like, I got to tell the brands, I got to tell it, I'm mad legal etc. and then like then it's there and you got to use it and it's like, well, did we actually spend enough time with the people who are the ones explaining it to the brands? Like, hey, here's how you can leverage this technology versus what you've done with Cadence Journeys or your segment story versus how we can pivot.

00:30:29:25 - 00:30:45:49
不明
So not a robot, but I do think it's a critical part in change management of like, don't overlook the people that you just assume are the advocates because they're an omni channel for us. And it's like, oh, you're welcome. We're giving you this tool. But it's like, did we bring you along enough so that you're explaining it effectively to the brands and how it can be leveraged?

00:30:45:54 - 00:31:09:22
不明
And all that. But, I mean, I think that like when I think about roadblocks for, you know, what we've done and what we're trying to do, it is navigating, you know, there's so much data, what's the right data because you're never going to have a perfect database, right? There's always going to be, you know, flaws. But are you looking at it in a way and like, are we doing the due diligence to make sure that we validated the data that's going into it to be able to action off the right way?

00:31:09:27 - 00:31:23:42
不明
And then constantly going back and checking that. And I think that's a critical part of the pathway is, you know, we can get to ROI. But before that, like, are we getting the engagement? Are we getting the behavior we want? You know, because if if we're looking at just baseline metrics, it might not always tell the right story.

00:31:23:42 - 00:31:42:52
不明
Right. You know, you know, open right click through, you know, time on site. You know, you know those are usually traditional metrics. We're like hey yeah they opened it to unsubscribe and go to your site and write a letter about why you sent them the wrong content. Like not helpful, but like if you're not going back and thinking about that and just kind of like, hey, we're hitting all of our benchmarks, that data can work against you.

00:31:42:52 - 00:32:04:16
不明
So I think for us, it's always going back and validating the data. What are we putting into the system to make sure what we're getting out of it? Because like, there's so much data we could leverage, but what's the most valuable that and that we have? And how do we get everyone on board to make sure that they're on the same page with legitimately cannot imagine having enough energy to do that?

00:32:04:21 - 00:32:36:07
不明
Oh, the nobo is not the place for you. No, no, no, I mean the part where you have like a use case of like somebody clicks through to unsubscribe and then send you hate mail about sending them the wrong content. That's the part I can't imagine doing. That's actually like a personal story that I use with my team to remind them that, like, if you're not digging into the metrics, it can tell you a very different story, because I, I did do I did do all that, but it was all did I try and tell somebody that your survey was awful and my experience was awful, but I was all over the site.

00:32:36:07 - 00:32:53:55
不明
I probably had seven minutes time on site, so I use I won't say what company because I promised, the person who husband works there, I would, but I use that story to make that point because that is a serious roadblock. And getting the experience right is if you're not actually, you know, looking at the data right and feeding the right data into the engine.

00:32:54:00 - 00:33:26:09
不明
Right. So before I come to you for return on investment, Laura, if you had to name a roadblock right in your project, what would it have been? The primary hurdle that you had to overcome? I'd say it's ensuring getting all brands, everyone. I'm not sure, big or small, but the larger the company, often the more silos there are and the more challenges there are in really trying to standardize but also centralize, certain activities and behavior.

00:33:26:09 - 00:33:54:14
不明
So, before our investment in Nam, we really didn't have an enterprise dam. So when we think about each of our brands really operated in kind of their own silo with their own agency partner. So until then, we thought about leveraging technology and starting to centralize all of our brands into one place that that's really what's one of the biggest hurdles, because we didn't have visibility into how teams are operating, what their what their content is, how long it's taking them, what their benchmarks and guidelines are.

00:33:54:14 - 00:34:15:34
不明
In terms of templates, we didn't know visibility. So by now, centralizing that was really the biggest hurdle. And we're still trying to get brands on board and get them into that central model. But I'd say that's the hardest process. This company that's been very rooted in silos for a while is bringing them together. And change management and management obviously is critical to that, right.

00:34:15:37 - 00:34:41:06
不明
In order to kind of overcome the silos or the little fiefdoms of this is how we do it. And it's always been this way. Exactly. Okay now, but I love I just want to underscore what's in it for me with them. I mean, I just think that such a smart approach, and I've just been thinking about it in my own world way, you'll get adoption and then you it's almost tricking your, your kind of customer in that team.

00:34:41:06 - 00:35:00:58
不明
It's like you're telling marketers, we've heard you, you want visibility into how long your agencies are taking to create content. Well, now work front will show you that, yes, we want to know cost savings and how much you're spending with each other. You now have that to looking at each kind of partner involved and what's really their goal, and reminding them over and over again, correct.

00:35:01:03 - 00:35:38:33
不明
And so Blair, let's talk about cost savings. Right. Because your whole use case was this value scorecard. Yeah. Right. And so there's two parts to my question. One is how much or what changes to your operation operational model. Right. Did you have to implement in order to get to the ability to track this scorecard and then my hope is that you can actually share with the audience today a little bit of the results, right, that you've gotten in terms of return on investment.

00:35:38:38 - 00:36:08:45
不明
Well, I mean, the Adobe platforms are essentially powering the digital spine of the organization at this point, right? All of our core websites, all of our emails, all of our messaging, everything. So I think it's important to understand that business as usual is being driven by these core platforms. And our biggest challenge was that marketing could not get to the value metrics that they needed in order to prove what they were doing in terms of growth of funnel.

00:36:08:45 - 00:36:31:32
不明
And then increasing funnel conversions essentially into the back end of the websites. So I went really hard in the paint on what essentially was a very glorified gap analysis. So I went team by team, and I found the teams that had a value calculation or had provable value that they had driven with Adobe Target or with APM or with the dam.

00:36:31:37 - 00:36:50:28
不明
And then I took that math and I brought it to the other teams, and it's very much like bringing everybody together, which was very challenging. We started with testing and personalization, and we created a cross-functional group of people that were this mes at that level, right? The people that are actually hands on keyboards and that are measuring these tests.

00:36:50:33 - 00:37:06:46
不明
And then they started to riff off of each other, and they came up with this incredible calculator that met all of the needs, and they were all pressure testing it because, you know, it's a bunch of data nerds. I love them. And then we took that cross-functional group and we're starting to apply it into some other spots.

00:37:06:46 - 00:37:33:54
不明
We have like a really incredible work front governance board that actually, meets on a monthly basis. They really have their, you know what? Together, they're now riffing off of each other to figure out their value scorecard. And by constantly raising this issue of what is the benefit to the business of what we are doing, even if, you know, it's table stakes, even if you know it's practical, even if you know it's the right decision, it doesn't matter unless we can like, quantify it.

00:37:33:59 - 00:38:10:44
不明
So it kind of goes back a little bit to what Laura was talking about. Or you chose one brand and I'm sure you had to do a lot of this is where we are and make sure that you were anchored in the data so that when you were able to showcase where you went, you could show that, you know, the benefit, and helping teams to actually ground themselves in whatever data they have and to build out that calculation and to push themselves into the point of, I'm not just going to say my engagement is great, I am showing this is the value that I have driven incrementally and, you know, we're we're making

00:38:10:44 - 00:38:35:26
不明
progress. We I mean, I think right now the value scorecard uses over 35 different sources of data across Adobe Analytics, customer Journey Analytics, Tableau dashboards, Excel and PowerPoint. And actually, I'm working with Adobe to figure out more streamlined ways of capturing that data and then hopefully being able to, you know, continue to proselytize. But we'd never measure this before.

00:38:35:31 - 00:38:58:12
不明
Everybody was measuring engagement, which is great, don't get me wrong. But like, I am obsessed with driving actual incremental money. And by the end of it, we came out with an estimated, 62 to $69 million in incremental Ebit for 2024. I mean, in costs, savings, I mean in driving margin. So there was some B2B growth in there.

00:38:58:12 - 00:39:23:18
不明
There was some testing and personalization growth. And there there were incremental email campaigns in there. And it's it's just it's a totally new muscle. So everybody is sort of like getting in there and figuring out how to flex it. And we're finding more and more data sets, some more ways to turn the value scorecard green every day. And now I have a couple of different teammates on the CEO here is obsessed with it as I am, which is very fun, but it's a little bit like a treasure hunt.

00:39:23:18 - 00:39:49:46
不明
But you have to do the math and you have to stay disciplined, and you have to measure what you're doing before you make the changes. Like that's critical, even if it's like it takes me nine hours to write a member letter. And then when I implemented, I was able to shave off 90 minutes. That's meaningful. But like, do the math, write it down.

00:39:49:51 - 00:40:22:12
不明
Okay. I like what you said in terms of make sure you set the baselines right based on how things are working now. Right. Because then you can actually measure even the smallest incremental change, right. And any change, whether it's increasing kind of revenue through engagement or if it's driving down costs, direct costs, resource costs, whatever, whatever it might be, that's how you can justify, right, the investment that you.

00:40:22:12 - 00:40:55:59
不明
But it's hard it's hard to have the discipline to do that initial measurement. It's really hard because you get so excited to get going, or at least I do. But I was not so great always at anchoring myself in. Make sure that you're measuring it from the beginning, and I'm a very, like, exuberant, fluid person. And I had a leader who was extremely data driven and calm and organized, and she was like the best possible influence on me because it helped me ground myself and the fact that the only way for us to show incremental growth was to know where we started.

00:40:56:04 - 00:41:00:22
不明
So write it down.

00:41:00:27 - 00:41:20:58
不明
So, West, can you share any kind of tangible results that you've generated at Novo through this project? Yeah. So, you know, I push my team in two different ways when we're doing things like this. And, you know, and one I know they're tired of hearing about, but it's it's the one I find gets overlooked the most because of that speed of business because of just moving forward.

00:41:20:58 - 00:41:37:21
不明
And that's what is it that we'll be successful if we do this, you know, and I go with like, what is the behavior trying to change and how are you going to measure if you change that behavior. So you you know what it is. So you're not just using data to fit your narrative. You've identified how you're going to actually measure success.

00:41:37:21 - 00:41:52:27
不明
And then that becomes that leading indicator. You know, then you know, beyond that you get into, you know, more significant metrics of the engagement and the open rate. But are you driving towards that ultimate business value and, you know, same thing, I know, but I'm like, listen, at the end of the day, if it's not turning into a script, it doesn't really matter.

00:41:52:27 - 00:42:09:11
不明
And no matter what benchmarks you might have crushed, if it's not leading to overall business value, then it's not the right thing to do. So I mean, those are those are kind of the two lanes. You know, we look at and we've done things with ADP where we can demonstrate that value, like, you know, getting that opt in from a customer.

00:42:09:16 - 00:42:26:58
不明
It's very hard huge though, especially in this, you know, in the world we live in with privacy and all that. So you know, on our HCP portal, you know, the standard, you know, just register button. But we're using the technology like all right. What are the behaviors that we're seeing that we can now insert a modal to, you know, get a registry.

00:42:27:05 - 00:42:52:46
不明
And while they're like consuming something that they find value because the technologies are looking at allowing us to know that. And by doing that and leveraging it, we increased registration by eight fold, which for, you know, for us, for Http has a defined fold, eight fold as far as just allowing them to register on their own to inserting modals along the way, where we knew this was a point that if we were to to drive it now, we're more likely to get and we saw that eight fold increase.

00:42:52:46 - 00:43:19:58
不明
And a lot of that comes from non call plan customers. So that allows us to go to a much wider audience with a much more profitable mechanism quite frankly because there's not a not the reps are incredibly important. Let me make that clear. I love every rep at Novo Nordisk and they are adding value. But if I can get a customer who does not have the opportunity to have a rep because I got that registration by using a technology that's worth that much more and expands our total footprint.

00:43:19:58 - 00:43:40:12
不明
I mean, we've seen, you know, the other doubling of engagement because we're being more personalized in the messaging, consuming content that we want them to consume because we're bringing them along the journey versus a multichannel approach, etc.. But but the eightfold increase is honestly one of my favorite metrics, because it's just so definable to a company of each one represents X dollars times.

00:43:40:12 - 00:44:04:45
不明
You know, Y leads to this incremental revenue that we would not have gotten just by leveraging, you know, this technology. I mean, $62 million and margin eight fold increase. Laura, can you top it? Can't top it maybe next year. Because I think blur brings up a really good point is you have to know going into it what is really the objective and goal.

00:44:04:49 - 00:44:25:39
不明
And I think for, for us, we're really in kind of that phase one where our, our focus right now is speed. We really saw a need to streamline our end to end content supply chain. So all the way from ideation of your content briefs through creation, review, deployment, everything. So our focus up front was speed, which a lot of it was investment in that foundational technology.

00:44:25:39 - 00:44:50:20
不明
So establishing a dam, establishing a workflow management tool with work front, starting to create templates, use of sites, for different channels and tactics. And I think that's really what year one was kind of focus on is really setting that up and driving that speed, which we have seen, almost up to 50% faster, awesome speed. In terms of just showing what that end to end can look like.

00:44:50:20 - 00:45:08:43
不明
But I think in terms of costs or anything that comes this next step, it's it's where we're going next, which I think the keynote everyone's been focused on is once you have the foundation, we can then accelerate. So once we have our dam set up and we have our taxonomy, we can then measure, we can then auto tag, we can now have kind of more streamlined tools or AI.

00:45:08:43 - 00:45:23:27
不明
Once we have our content, we can start to train and maybe get generated content. And I think that's where we're going to see the cost savings. We're going to see even kind of that increase on investment is this next phase of once you have the foundation, then where you can go in the next five years. So it's not all up front.

00:45:23:27 - 00:45:42:10
不明
But I think knowing that and sharing that kind of with leadership during buy in is you're not going to see cost savings up front. Maybe. But these are what we're going to see and we will get there. It's just going to take time. Well, by simply kind of improving your content process from initiation to delivery to the tune of 50%.

00:45:42:10 - 00:46:02:13
不明
I mean, that's significant. It's. Yeah. And it links then where we've been seeing the impact is it'll be more competitive because we can get things to our customers, both physicians and patients, faster. Which then I talked about drives engagement. Engagement drives revenue. It's all connected. But that goes back to again, that was our kind of value prop upfront.

00:46:02:18 - 00:46:20:45
不明
It wasn't upfront sales or cost savings. It was let's look end to end and start to fix the processes and identify areas for kind of solutions as well. So a new kind of led me into what's essentially our last question today, which is kind of what's on the horizon right now. You were talking about kind of what's next.

00:46:20:45 - 00:46:48:43
不明
It's like now that you've actually increased the speed, what's your next primary goal? I don't want to be the one that says buzzword of gen AI, but, I think what's exciting are what we can. Right. Is really starting to assess now. Okay. Where do we really need value of obviously the human element. So we think about and not end to end where is or the most value in terms of strategy up front creative core brand strategy.

00:46:48:43 - 00:47:09:01
不明
That's that's things that we can't replace or we don't want to replace. But where are there areas of really manual tasks we can start to automate? And that's where I think we can really bring in to try to help improve the quality of our content in our submissions. That will then help speed up our reviewers time in terms of reviewing all of our content and kind of the tiresome burden there.

00:47:09:01 - 00:47:29:16
不明
Or think about even the up front of, copilot functions or, the agen tech agents, and work front to help co-write a brief or help your marketers actually, manage that end, workflow with kind of that partnership or support. I think that's where we're starting to look at is now where do we really need just human versus where can we have human and AI to accelerate that?

00:47:29:16 - 00:47:51:01
不明
So that's where I get excited in the next, next year. How about you blur? What's next for CVS health? Well, there's a lot actually on the docket for CVS health because there are three large companies in there. I think that we're focused on content supply chain, and figuring out how to do it very, very responsibly. Which is tough in healthcare.

00:47:51:01 - 00:48:19:03
不明
Right? The authenticity is absolutely critical in our space, more so than it is in others. And so using it responsibly is a big piece. We're also right now doing a bunch of exciting things with content fragments and using, an API to start driving, content fragments into actual multichannel. And then continuing to laser focus in on how we are driving value and putting points on the board.

00:48:19:08 - 00:48:39:29
不明
I want my marketers to go into every conversation with a shield and a sword. I want them to be able to get funding. I want them to be able to push the envelope. I want them to be able to push as much innovation as possible. And so making sure that they're backed up with real data and real value is, to me, just a critical moment.

00:48:39:34 - 00:48:59:30
不明
And I wish you, you know, we're protecting me that way. West. What's next for Novo? I mean, so, you know, we're all doing a lot of the same things. I think for us, it's really starting to connect different systems together. So, you know, I mean, I think most pharma at this point is using some type of predictive model to get a next best engagement.

00:48:59:34 - 00:49:22:40
不明
You know, out there. I know and you know, how are we leveraging that with ADP and creating that integration that we can deliver that real time personalization as we need it, but also allowing that to feed into that predictive model to generate the next best engagement.

Even better experience will then feed back in and get that going. So that's a big focus for right now, is how I'm getting those different systems and platforms to start working together more and more to again create that customer experience that will, you know, get us to the next integration. Awesome. Thank you. Well, thank you all very much for the questions, for sticking around.
