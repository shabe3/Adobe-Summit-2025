Hey, everyone. My name is Rich Wiley and I lead our commerce partnerships. That TikTok. I'm super excited to be here today. Not just because it's Adobe Summit, but because we have some exciting news to share with you. TikTok and Adobe Commerce are launching a new integration. But before I get to that, as well as some great discussion with our friends from Adobe.

00:00:21:39 - 00:00:50:33
不明
Allow me a minute to set the scene. TikTok is more than an entertainment platform. It's a shopping destination where people are discovering and shopping every day, and hashtag TikTok made me buy. It is a commerce phenomenon that brands of all sizes can be a part of. In fact, most remote 56% of users say that ads on TikTok have led them to discover a new brand or product.

00:00:50:38 - 00:01:23:13
不明
And with over 170 million US users on TikTok, we reach over half the US population. Our community is as active and vibrant as ever. Spending about a movie's worth of time on TikTok each and every day. All of the entertainment, consumption, shopping and connection happening on TikTok is driven by a diverse audience of sports enthusiasts, parents, affluent consumers and many others.

00:01:23:18 - 00:01:50:13
不明
To put it simply, TikTok remains to be a platform where audiences are engaged. Culture sparks and evolves, and discovery leads you to what's happening next. And with 64% of users agreeing that the content on TikTok is culturally relevant, it's clear that TikTok offers content with a level of depth, diversity and relevancy that just isn't available in other platforms.

00:01:50:18 - 00:02:27:40
不明
And hey, we're the go to destination for not only experiencing, but participating in the world's biggest cultural moments. And now is not the time to miss out. All right, let's get down to some discussion. I'd love to welcome on the stage Marie and Ritesh from Adobe to discuss how TikTok and Adobe Commerce are making it easier than ever for merchants to connect with consumers and drive conversions.

00:02:27:45 - 00:02:31:46
不明
Okay, I'll do a little transition.

00:02:31:51 - 00:02:54:06
不明
Thank you. Rich. Hey, Marie. Hey, Ritesh. Great to see you. Absolutely. Thanks so much for joining me. All right, let's start with a quick round of intros. And one final question. What was the last thing you bought because of TikTok? Marie, I'll start with you. All right, ladies first. Hello, I am Marie Knight. I am responsible for technology partnerships.

00:02:54:10 - 00:03:16:40
不明
At Adobe, which lets me work with our friends here at TikTok. I've been at Adobe for a decade. Next week, which means I get a sabbatical. If you know anything about Adobe. But the last thing, the last, hashtag Tik Tok made me buy it moment for me was this joy moop mop. So I have a 15 month at home.

00:03:16:46 - 00:03:41:12
不明
At home? And he's obsessed with eating oranges. So there's just like, imagine orange juice everywhere because he eats them, and then he spits them out into my floor. Is disgusting. And TikTok knew this somehow and showed me this joy up. And so now my floors are clean and I don't have that problem anymore. Amazing. Nice. My name is Ritesh Soleimani.

00:03:41:16 - 00:04:19:25
不明
I, had a, value added services for Adobe Commerce here at Adobe. I've been at Adobe for over four years, but before then, I've been in the commerce and payment space for about 18 years, primarily working on technical solutions. So happy to be here. And let's see, the last purchase for me was, well, it might sort of be an obsession, but, I mean, the vacuum cleaners and TikTok suggested one was a cordless one for my car, which is super convenient and super nice, and it gets into all the little crevices and cracks.

00:04:19:30 - 00:04:39:56
不明
And now when the kids are in the back and they're fighting, I just hand them that vacuum, like make yourself useful and stop fighting. So it's worked out really well. I mean, we both have cleaner homes, but I was just going to say two fans of TikTok people after my own heart. For me, I'm a plant guy.

00:04:40:01 - 00:05:14:29
不明
And so you can guess the last thing I bought in TikTok was the plants. Can't help myself. You should see my apartment. All right, let's get into some questions. Ritesh, from your perspective, how does TikTok, his approach to commerce differ from other platforms? And what excites you about our diverse and engaged community? Yeah, so I think the interesting thing about TikTok is, you know, TikTok helps Adobe Commerce customers meet their meet the Consumer at the place where they are, right?

00:05:14:29 - 00:05:57:04
不明
Which is TikTok. And if you, if you're able to to listen to the keynote earlier today, Adobe and Adobe Commerce have been focused on personalization. And personalization is super important for us in delivering the right customer journeys and the right customer experiences. And I think, you know, working with, TikTok, it's really interesting because a merchant or a brand can get sort of that personal, personalized impact in terms of delivering, you know, the right commerce experience, but you know, where someone already is at, which is on the TikTok channel.

00:05:57:09 - 00:06:20:40
不明
100% to echo that, through content and commerce, TikTok has transformed the way that people discover three out of four shoppers agree on TikTok. It's their go to place to discover new brands and products. Marie, can you walk us through what this integration means for merchants? Yeah, absolutely. What we've seen so far is this is just time back in someone's day.

00:06:20:45 - 00:06:45:58
不明
So rather than navigating, you know, we think about our customer who is the merchant. So instead of navigating multiple screens across Adobe Commerce TikTok in an effort to find your customer, we're now making that a seamless experience and removing the friction. It just provides a better customer experience because our merchants can reach their customers where they are.

00:06:46:03 - 00:07:17:06
不明
Absolutely. Yeah. And and I would echo that. 110%. Right. The the power of this. As Marie mentioned, is sort of that seamless shopping experience, reducing any friction. But more importantly, it's about delivering that experience where the shopper is at. I mean, we've all been in those certain situations where and I'm a payments guy, so we've all tried to purchase something and then you're about to click pay and then it bounces you to another website and then you're like, am I still on the same website?

00:07:17:06 - 00:07:37:48
不明
And I've got to do all the same thing that I forgot about where I started from in the first place, right? And so the more that we can avoid those type of disruptions and really just deliver the commerce experience in the setting that the consumer wants to be in, I think is, is, you know, the way to create maximum conversion and revenue.

00:07:37:53 - 00:08:00:09
不明
I couldn't agree more. This integration makes aims to make it as easy as possible for merchants to connect to TikTok and add a new channel to their strategy. Ritesh, back to you. From a technical standpoint, how does our integration and features fit into the overall tech stack of an Adobe commerce merchant? Yeah. So, Rich, that's a good question.

00:08:00:10 - 00:08:26:15
不明
And I'm really happy about how this TikTok integration has come together. It's been built in a way to like like you mentioned, it integrates seamlessly into Adobe Commerce. But what that what that means is it provides, two types of benefits. Right? So there's the benefit of getting, e-commerce features, but also combined with, you know, the advertising benefit.

00:08:26:15 - 00:08:58:19
不明
So like on the e-commerce side or the Adobe Commerce side, what it allows someone to do is quickly plug in to your Adobe Commerce catalog and, you know, just settings like which products are important, from the Adobe Commerce catalog. Take those out. What's the frequency of sync? For the products between commerce and TikTok so that, you know, you can you're not you're inventory is not that out of sync depending on what type of business you have.

00:08:58:24 - 00:09:27:14
不明
But I think the real power is on the, advertising side. And on the advertising side, this integration allows folks to quickly, you know, sort of connect into your business center account. All of your, your, your advertising account on the tick tock side. And what I think is part of the magic here is it automatically allows the TikTok pixel to be configured across the Adobe commerce site.

00:09:27:25 - 00:09:52:42
不明
And what that means is that all of your sort of metrics and measurements that you're looking for just sort of automatically happen. And look, yeah, you can create custom code, do an integration and, and accomplish all of this stuff. But why do that when our friends of TikTok have already done it and continue to make it their problem to keep it updated and, and, with all the latest features.

00:09:52:42 - 00:10:13:34
不明
Right. That's just one less thing merchants and brands have to worry about. So I think it's a it's a great integration, that can drive benefit. You make some really great points. Part of making it easy is ensuring peace of mind that things are going to work as you expect, and also seamlessly fit into how you're already operating your business.

00:10:13:39 - 00:10:44:49
不明
Let's touch on this topic a little more. For small and global commerce brands, managing a product catalog and maintaining accurate inventory is a huge challenge, and we're excited that this integration makes it as seamless as possible for merchants. Marie, how do you think this helps merchants stay ahead? Yeah, it's a good question. I think, look, we have merchants need to adjust to any new trends that are going on so a product can go viral overnight, especially on TikTok.

00:10:44:54 - 00:11:03:09
不明
I know all of you are sitting here thinking, wow, I really need to clean my house when I get home and how am I going to do it? So maybe the movement goes viral, maybe the vacuum cleaner. Maybe you need some plants. Like we're all about household care here. But if a if a product goes viral overnight, how do you react to it?

00:11:03:14 - 00:11:24:25
不明
Your expertise is in making those products and keeping your inventory up to date, but you don't want to be promoting an ad on TikTok for something that you've actually sold out on. So again, we are trying to reduce the space between TikTok and Adobe to help you, as a merchant, reach your customer faster and with more accurate information.

00:11:24:25 - 00:11:50:12
不明
So Ritesh was talking about product sinking and inventory sinking. That helps make sure that anything your customers see on TikTok is up to date with your current catalog. Who has time these days to manage every little thing when you could be investing in the bigger, more strategic stuff? This is why my next topic is something that I'm sure many of you feel is key to an efficient future.

00:11:50:16 - 00:12:16:23
不明
AI is one of the hottest topics in the industry right now, and TikTok is investing heavily in AI powered solutions for both our campaign optimization and content creation. Ritesh, what are some of the biggest challenges, day to day that brands face? And how do you think AI is going to change how people operate? Yeah, that is the million dollar question, right?

00:12:16:28 - 00:12:39:00
不明
Like the way that I the the way that I see it especially for AI is, you know, it's more than just a trend or a wish. It's becoming real. And, you know, you heard Jonathan. You talk about this earlier. I mean, Adobe is invested in Janai in all of this and across all of our product lines.

00:12:39:05 - 00:13:05:48
不明
And I believe the merchants who are able to identify fi how to productively and efficiently use AI are the ones that are going to stand, you know, stand out from the rest of the crowd. And so the key here is, you know, how do you take this concept of AI and transform it into a way that's, you know, commercial and practical and that type of thing?

00:13:05:52 - 00:13:43:01
不明
You know, like I said, on the on the Adobe side, we are heavily invested in trying to create these gen AI experience across all of our products. But also, you know, in Adobe Commerce, there's, you know, image variations, AB testing, you know, content authoring, all with sort of that built in AI intelligence, which, allows folks to quickly iterate and quickly, make changes to things that, you know, seemingly took a long time to do before.

00:13:43:03 - 00:14:25:57
不明
And so in, in fact, with some of our, you know, Jenny, AI assets, for example, that helps with the image, variations. Out of the box natively. Em allows, you know, authoring to even set different tones for your, for your web pages. For content pages, product pages, all of that stuff. And it really reduces the friction and helps people use AI in a, tangible way, in a commercial way, more than just, you know, hey, can I make a, you know, a cute, cute image of a unicorn flying through the sky or something like that?

00:14:26:02 - 00:14:48:38
不明
Yeah. Generative AI is becoming a really powerful tool tool for marketers to execute quickly and efficiently. Products like our Smart Plus campaign, for example, you can create a new campaign with just a few inputs, and TikTok will automate and optimize the rest. And we'd like to share a quick video.

00:14:48:43 - 00:15:19:28
不明
Nobody said performance marketing was easy. It can feel like the further you move down the funnel, the harder it becomes at tick tock. We solve problems for you. Introducing smart campaigns. Smart POS builds campaigns from A to Z, automated by TikTok and powered by AI. If you're looking to maximize your ad performance across sales, web conversions, lead generation, and your app, Smart Plus is here to help.

00:15:19:37 - 00:15:47:01
不明
Smart plus will automate ad delivery to drive better performance across your business's KPIs. Create and manage your ads to save you time and develop automated created assets while reducing costs and burnout with smart policies help boost performance and produce results across your key business objectives. Take back your time and leave the heavy lifting to us. Get Smart Quest.

00:15:47:06 - 00:16:10:46
不明
All right. What's exciting is that Smart Plus campaigns are available today via TikTok Ads manager. But what's even more exciting is smart plugs campaigns will be part of the new integration we're launching. All right. Ritesh, can you share how merchants can get set up? Yeah. I mean, I think this is the this is the best question because it's the easiest question.

00:16:10:51 - 00:16:40:24
不明
It's it works in the same way as any extension on the, Adobe Commerce Marketplace. So you just go to the website of the marketplace, I should say acquire the extension. You know, go through the process of installing it. And once that's done, it's really simple, as we've been talking about, in order, like all of the settings show up right there and admin connect, you know, your business account, connect your ads account and you know you're ready to go.

00:16:40:24 - 00:17:02:46
不明
And so it is as easy as almost like one, two, three and getting everything up and running. So, you know, like I said before, you can do this, it would just, you know, multiple manual steps. And now everything's sort of put together. So, just visit the marketplace and get, get started. I'd say it's as easy as that.

00:17:02:51 - 00:17:30:00
不明
All right. This next one's for both of you. For businesses in the audience today, what's one thing that they can do right now to maximize their success on TikTok and Adobe Commerce? Marie, we'll start with you. I don't think it's just one thing. I think for all of you in the room today, it's attendee sessions. Learn about what's available and then bring that back and use the tools that we're making available to you.

00:17:30:05 - 00:17:53:13
不明
So use Smart Plus campaigns on TikTok. Use experience platform to to do segmentation and find your customer, your ideal customer audience. Use Adobe Commerce to make sure that you have your catalog in inventory updated for the campaigns you're going to run. You're you're here because you want to learn about that. And you probably have access to these tools.

00:17:53:13 - 00:18:33:51
不明
In some ways it's use what you already have, but use, you know, learn more about the newest features. So we can do let the technology do some of the work for you. Yeah, I mean, I I'd echo what Marie said here and just basically, you know, for me it's just get started, right? I mean, we're in an age now where, technology and and, you know, resources, technical resources are so cheap and the capabilities, as we were just discussing earlier, right around AI are so available that, you know, campaigns and variations that you had to think about before.

00:18:33:55 - 00:19:06:10
不明
And we're wondering whether this is, you know, worth the ROI. It's almost a no brainer. And, you know, take some of those image variations, look at how you are positioning for your different segments, try things out, do some AB testing. And it's it's relatively, inexpensive and quick to get some of those things running. And then you'll figure out, you know, what converts better, how you can optimize for the different segments that you're serving, and then obviously narrow down on the on the areas that make sense.

00:19:06:10 - 00:19:26:15
不明
But, you know, again, I think it just starts with, you know, getting started and experimenting. I mean, I'm a product guy. Maybe I, I love tinkering on with stuff. But I think in this day and age of technology, you don't have to worry about the costs. Just get at it 100%. I mean, what I'm hearing is if you haven't started, now's the time.

00:19:26:20 - 00:19:47:41
不明
And don't be hesitant to test and learn across all the different tools that are available to you today. Are there any final words that you'd like to leave the audience with any exciting opportunities? Marie, I'll start with you again. Yeah, I think again, as the partner person, I want you to take advantage of all the new and exciting things we're doing together.

00:19:47:42 - 00:20:14:41
不明
So obviously this integration with Adobe Commerce is one. We're also we announced at the end of last year and coming soon, we'll have live our Adobe Gen Studio for performance, marketing and TikTok integration. So that's taking the gen AI asset creation even further into how do you automate optimize in a brand on brand compliant way, for paid performance media?

00:20:14:42 - 00:20:41:27
不明
So there's even more we're doing together, and I'm sure we'll come up with something else after summit. So more more to come. Yeah, I would say, I mean, of course this integration is cool, but I think it's, it's, on on point too, because as you heard again in the, in the keynote. Right. Adobe is invested a lot in Chennai and personalized experiences and personalized experiences at scale.

00:20:41:27 - 00:21:19:25
不明
Right. And all of those things tie very well with some of the the topics that we've been talking about here. And how do you experiment and how do you target the right segments in the right way at the right place? Right. Which in this conversation is, you know, your consumers that are on TikTok. And so I think, you know, getting started again with this, with this extension, and you'll continue to see not only enhancements obviously, coming from the TikTok side, but also from the Adobe side, because I think we're all, you know, pushing in in the same direction.

00:21:19:30 - 00:21:40:39
不明
And I'd like to just end off by saying like, thank you for everyone being here, because this is sort of that first step and learning about what makes sense and, and how to continue to, you know, target the right segments and increase conversion and revenue. And, again, you know, I'm super excited about our TikTok partnership and the integration.

00:21:40:44 - 00:22:06:15
不明
It's it's an easy to use extension that can get, you know, people in front of the customers where they're at. Can you set it better? Thank you both so much for the insights today. I'm excited. Personally, this integration is currently in open beta. I'm going to take a moment and ask the TikTok team in the audience to raise their hands.

00:22:06:19 - 00:22:25:11
不明
So these are the folks that can answer questions for you, on our integration as well as our talk tag today. Please come by and say hi to us at our booth. We'll be there. Thank you everyone so much.

00:22:25:16 - 00:22:25:28
不明
For.
