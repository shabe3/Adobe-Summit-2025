00:00:00:01 - 00:00:23:28
不明
First of all, welcome. I hope everybody's having a good summit. Welcome to our session. We know you got a lot of choices when you fly, so we appreciate you flying with us. I'm John Burdette. I'm the director of industry, global industry strategy for manufacturing. And I'm joined here today by two gentlemen from, GE healthcare, Tom Gorse and Ronnie Sarwar.

00:00:23:32 - 00:00:45:39
不明
And just to kind of set the stage for you today. What I like to do is I like to not use buzzwords, talk about things kind of as they really are. We talk about digital transformation, but it kind of becomes a term that is used so much it loses a little bit of meaning. So I'm a big fan of, the author and public speaker.

00:00:45:44 - 00:01:06:22
不明
Simon Sinek, if anybody's familiar with him, talks about, find your why. So my why is obviously, you know, my family, my kids giving them a better life, doing the best I can in my career for them. My wife is also from a professional perspective, related to where I'm from. So I'm from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Anybody here from Pittsburgh?

00:01:06:26 - 00:01:32:24
不明
I'm probably the only one. That's all right. Is anybody here from Baltimore? We let you in anyway. But, you know, Pittsburgh, if you aren't familiar, lost about 20% of its population, between 15 and 20% of its population in the early 80s. When I was a kid, and we lost estimated between 10 to 20% of our GDP along with those folks.

00:01:32:28 - 00:01:56:14
不明
And the reason we lost it was because of, a significant downturn in our major industry, which was still we lost a lot of our B2B manufacturing. So we were suffering from outsourcing and challenges with global trade before it was cool. And what we experienced was over the, resulting decades is that we rebuilt ourselves. There was no federal bailout.

00:01:56:25 - 00:02:19:57
不明
There was no, outside help so much. A little bit from federal government, the state, but not really. And what we did was we reinvented ourselves. It was genuine transformation. We did it through, revitalizing our industries to include high technology software as a big as an Adobe office there. There's a Google office there. There's a large SAP office there.

00:02:19:57 - 00:02:43:40
不明
There's Uber. There's I think Toyota motors has a facility, an autonomous car facility there. So we reinvented ourselves and my community, outside of Pittsburgh, where my family and I live, is called Aspen Wall, and it is a bunch of Victorian era homes. 1915 and 1920 with grape mounds. Right. Really nice looking houses that went through an era of disrepair.

00:02:43:45 - 00:03:06:32
不明
And me and all of my neighbor friends can tell you anything you want to know about rehabbing 100 year old home. And that's what I kind of see B2B manufacturing going through, right? It's going through sometimes a bit of a revitalization. Maybe you're doing the equivalent of a kitchen rehab. Maybe some of you, like me, are taking your house down to the studs and just totally starting over with good bonds and a good foundation.

00:03:06:33 - 00:03:25:52
不明
But either way, you're in the frontlines of transformation. It's not buzzwords. It's real. Right? And that's what I like to do. Whether it's webinars or public speaking, is I like to bring in folks who are actually going through it. And you're in no buzzword country right now. I've got two folks with me who are, you know, day to day.

00:03:25:52 - 00:03:52:59
不明
They are responsible. Ag health care for driving real transformation. Not just the words, but the actions, the hows along with the lies. Right. So what we're going to talk about is that lived experience. And that is my why B2B manufacturing is going to go through a renaissance in the next couple of decades. It already is, right. And I'm here to recruit you along with myself to help with that transformation.

00:03:53:04 - 00:04:12:44
不明
All right. So I want to give you a little bit just a quick overview, and then I'm going to get out of the way and I'm going to hand it over to Tom and Ronnie. And they're going to talk about the day to day of how this, is with their lived experience. So at Adobe, what we do is we run everything through what is generally called the lead to cash process.

00:04:12:49 - 00:04:43:18
不明
Right. So many of you are familiar with this. You're responsible for a portion of it, maybe, but the lead the cash process going from left left to right is taking your unidentified but mostly installed base of customers and trying to find, leads based on insights and opportunities leading to quotes and transactions at the top. And then the back end from like 12:00 to 3:00 is the service portion of lead the cash in some way, shape or form.

00:04:43:19 - 00:05:04:22
不明
If you're in marketing, if you're in operations, if you're in finance, you touch on this. Right. And it's all underpinned by, I would argue, two things your ability to manufacture products, as a manufacturer and content. And this isn't just an Adobe sort of preference. This is real because you think about it, your customers, before they buy content is what they're buying.

00:05:04:22 - 00:05:26:34
不明
First. You can't purchase. You don't want to buy what you don't understand, and you can't really easily own what you can't repair or fix or know details about. So this is what we put all of our for this new product development and manufacturing. When we go out and talk with customers, this is the lens with we view the world through to give manufacturing that goods.

00:05:26:34 - 00:05:55:35
不明
Second that that that is going through right now. And that's our mission. So we help companies Adobe in B2B manufacturing, industrial manufacturing do a couple of things, reduce costs to drive profitable revenues and differentiate versus competitors. This is why you're in the digital experience customer experience game. And we do it alongside our partners. We do it alongside independent software, companies, ISVs, and we do it so that you can have better profitability and resiliency.

00:05:55:39 - 00:06:14:09
不明
And we did a segmentation globally of all of our customers wins and our customer losses. And we were not asking, why did you buy Adobe? You're not about Adobe. We were asking why did you do why were you doing the use cases that you had set out to do? What was the underpinning business reason and what was the general area of work?

00:06:14:23 - 00:06:35:51
不明
And these are the four groupings we came up with. The segmentation. The first, so it's called create a Data Foundation for engagement that's getting your data house in order. Right. You can't manage what you can't measure. And you need the ability to collect and manage the data. Right. That's number one. Number two, which usually follows very closely, is digitally empowering your sales and marketing teams.

00:06:35:55 - 00:06:56:14
不明
This takes a bunch of different forms. This is getting your content engine up and running. That helps you keep your content organized so that your sales and customer service people are bogged down by where's the spec sheet? Where's this image? But it can also be content for your marketing team to get the right persona, the right information at the right time, and automating your marketing to improve quality.

00:06:56:28 - 00:07:19:35
不明
Right. These first two categories are where we're going to spend most of our time here today, with the folks from GE healthcare. Third is scalable, self-service. So being able to provide your customers with a place to go. So the 24 over seven 365 they can answer their own questions because a lot of the time, as much as your customers may like you and I hope they do, they don't always want to talk with you.

00:07:19:40 - 00:07:35:37
不明
You think about this in your own life. You don't always want to call customer service. Sometimes you just want to get the answers on your own. And then the fourth category is really fun. So once you've started to invest and build some scale across the first three categories you see on the slide, you can start to make money in new ways.

00:07:35:41 - 00:08:03:46
不明
This can be use cases as simplistic. Is selling non-digital products, right. Software updates, warranties, things like that. It can also be about selling bundles, right. Bundled SKUs, sales bombs that are typically called or can be the use cases that are a little bit more exotic, like powered by the our charging for hourly or per diem or per month usage of your products and allowing through IoT to measure the usage and start to sell in ways that are opex more than CapEx.

00:08:03:51 - 00:08:26:44
不明
So these are the four areas that we drive a lot of use case research in a lot of discussions, we do a lot of help with helping our customers build their strategies. So that's enough for me. I want to bring up, Tom and Ronnie to the stage. I'll let them introduce themselves. Let's give em a hand.

00:08:26:49 - 00:08:46:22
不明
Look. Thank you. John, thanks for that intro. We're super excited to be here at the best Marketing Conference out there, and excited to share some of our story at GE healthcare. Hopefully a story that resonates with a lot of you as you go through your own digital transformation. You heard it from the Adobe CMO today. Digital marketing is not an easy place to be right now.

00:08:46:36 - 00:09:07:13
不明
It's changing rapidly and we're all we're all in it together. So hopefully at least you come away from this presentation today thinking that you're not alone. But before we jump into a lot of this, we're going to do some intros, starting with Ronnie. Hi, I'm Ronnie Sarwar, this is my first Adobe summit. I first missed the first 22.

00:09:07:15 - 00:09:33:03
不明
So lucky 20 number 23. I'm really excited about learning a lot over the next few days and over the next hour, or sharing the GE healthcare transformation story with all of you. I lead the Digital Marketing Transformation team at GE healthcare. Internally, we call our CEO, call ourselves The Transformers, which is a reference to a cartoon I grew up watching in the late 1900s.

00:09:33:08 - 00:09:59:30
不明
Prior to working at GE healthcare, I worked at companies both large and small, from Walmart and Google to a couple of small healthcare startups. I held marketing positions in all of these companies, with the majority of them being in digital marketing roles. I'm motivated by driving results and addressing business challenges through more effective marketing driving innovation. We're changing the entire marketing tech stack.

00:09:59:35 - 00:10:18:33
不明
I live in that I grew up outside of Nashville and I live there today. I'm a proud husband and a father to a seven and nine year old, and spending time with my family is something I truly enjoy and cherish. I'm also a huge Lego fan, and that picture you see there is a combination of my two favorite things.

00:10:18:33 - 00:10:39:12
不明
That's us a couple of years ago at Legoland. And for those of you a falls in the audience, adult fans of Lego, that is a thing. Yes, I do have the Optimus Prime Lego set and over to my colleague and I'm Tom Gores. I am a Wisconsin native, proud husband, father of two. I've got a five year old and a two year old.

00:10:39:16 - 00:11:02:30
不明
It's fun. Almost 15 years of experience. And in digital space, ten of which were in retail and in the B2C world, the last for which B2B and in health care and the last eight of those really all around the same kind of work, which is optimization. And the way that I describe it to my grandma is that we we make websites better, we take websites and we look at everything that's possible.

00:11:02:30 - 00:11:20:11
不明
We make them better. I'm motivated by a problem solving, driving impact, kind of seeing the results of those opportunities. We uncover it actually come to life on the site. And from a leadership perspective, I'm inspired by by mentorship and coaching and helping people get to where they want to be in their careers. And I am a huge Adobe Summit fan.

00:11:20:15 - 00:11:43:56
不明
I've been coming to a few of these, and every time I leave feeling really inspired and excited to kind of continue the mission in our world. And I love this quote that I wanted to share, which is when we change the way we look at things, the things we look at change. And to me, this is all about the power of perspective and how we actually have more control over our experiences and our outcomes just by changing our perspective, going into something.

00:11:44:01 - 00:12:03:23
不明
And I'll share a quick personal story I was talking with with my wife about how chaotic it is with little kids and logistics and getting them places and illnesses and canceling Christmas and all that kind of stuff. And it's like I had this acceptance that we're in our family era. That's just that's where we're at. It's it's tough.

00:12:03:27 - 00:12:21:46
不明
It's temporary. And the only way out is through. And I then I had this realization that we're actually going through the same thing at GE healthcare, and we have been. And with that comes a lot of change. So now we're going to dive into the content. And unlike John, we're going to use as many buzzwords as we possibly can.

00:12:21:51 - 00:12:26:11
不明
Totally get it.

00:12:26:15 - 00:13:06:46
不明
Now before we dive into all that change and transformation, we're going to take a step back and go back to the 1800s. The history of GE healthcare starts with the history of GE, which was founded over 125 years ago. One of its co-founders is also a Tom Tom Edison. I think he went by Thomas. It started as an electric company, hence why GE stands for General Electric is one of the original 12 companies on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, along with companies at the time such as American Sugar Refining Company, United States, United States Leather Company, and National led company.

00:13:06:55 - 00:13:34:41
不明
Really descriptive themes back then. GE healthcare GE expanded into healthcare through acquisitions in the early 1900s. The focus early on was on x rays. Then it moved to patient, patient monitoring solutions and ultimately into bigger medical devices such as the Total Body CT scanner, which launched in the 1970s. I want to talk about how the company has evolved at a high level over this time.

00:13:34:46 - 00:14:07:26
不明
If you look at the first 100 years, there's this there's Mr. Edison. The company expanded into diverse industries and categories. We talked about health care, we talked about electricity. But GE also developed trains. They developed, for, home appliances. They developed jet engines and wind turbines, just to name a few. The diversity of the products and also the quality of those products helped establish a strong brand presence and brand name with consumers and customers.

00:14:07:31 - 00:14:32:54
不明
Another thing that the company did was it also developed a strong management and, sales organizations within the company, which is exists still to this day. If you look back at the last ten, 15 years, the focus is on digital, both in terms of how we connect with engage and convert our customers, but also how we incorporate digital into our products.

00:14:32:59 - 00:14:44:42
不明
At GE healthcare, we have 72 AI enabled, devices that are FDA authorized more than any other medical technology company.

00:14:44:47 - 00:15:13:22
不明
So we're going to continue this product innovation as we go forward. More recently, if you look at today and more recently, we're investing in the tech stack, not just within marketing but across the organization. We're also investing in digital expertise, leveling up the internal team members and colleagues that we have with new colleagues with new skills, and also bringing in a lot of digital experts from outside of GE, from different industries, and not just within health care.

00:15:13:36 - 00:15:18:51
不明
So we can level up our internal capabilities as a team.

00:15:18:56 - 00:15:42:03
不明
And now Tom is going to talk about a key inflection point within the company's history. So in January 2023, GE healthcare spun off as its own standalone fortune 500 company. And this immediately established us as a global leader in medical technology and in precision health care. This spinoff served as a pivotal milestone in both change and of opportunity for the organization.

00:15:42:07 - 00:16:04:51
不明
Gave us a chance to forge our own path and also rethink our priorities. And from our point of view. Sitting in digital marketing, we knew that we had world class health care products and a world class brand, and our website and our digital experiences and our marketing materials, they needed to better match that level of world class standards that the rest of the company did.

00:16:04:55 - 00:16:23:11
不明
And this also gave us the time that our new purpose statement as a company was born, which is to create a world where health care has no limits. And we were inspired by this and kind of went after this, this idea of no limits as we went through our own transformational journey, and we knew that there would be hurdles along the way.

00:16:23:15 - 00:16:49:45
不明
Yeah. Let me start and talk to you about some of the hurdles. We'll talk about complexity, and then we'll move on to a couple of other things. First of all, we're a global company. There are 50,000 colleagues supporting customers, and in 160 countries, in dozens of languages. The time zones and the sheer number of people make it super challenging to connect with and align with all those people.

00:16:49:50 - 00:17:18:23
不明
We have four business units. They're all unique. They have have unique customers, and honestly, they could be standalone companies with the marketing support and marketing infrastructure that they need. Next, we have over 500 marketers, I think actually close to 800 marketers within the company. This is an inclusive of regional teams, country teams, business unit teams and central teams.

00:17:18:28 - 00:17:48:23
不明
And they're all using different channels. They're using different platforms. They're create content. They're creating content differently. They're activating differently. So it's challenging to find something. Some platforms that that cover the use cases and the needs for all those marketers. And lastly, we're in a highly regulated space. There are US and international laws and regulations that we must adhere to on how we communicate with and about our products and services.

00:17:48:28 - 00:18:26:18
不明
Can we communicate with our customers about our products and services, and also even how what kind of data we collect about our customers, marketing data we collect about our customers? Next, I want to talk to how those complexities lead to some variances across the organization. Each team, region, and business segment country have their own goals. And as you all probably know, when you don't have shared goals or we have different goals, it's really hard to align and rally everyone around a specific project or initiative, especially those that require a lot of change.

00:18:26:23 - 00:19:07:41
不明
We had different interpretations of the marketing data and the KPIs, and in some cases how the KPIs were collected. At a more fundamental level, there were inconsistencies across the organization on what data was even collected in that region or that business unit. Lastly, we have all these marketers operating their course across the globe, and they're they're adapting to the local needs or their business unit needs or a combination of those of both, and they are going to do whatever they need to do to get the job done, execute their campaigns, develop that creative.

00:19:07:46 - 00:19:36:07
不明
And over time, that's creating variances, especially as people change roles and move across the organization, time progresses. More variances of process across the organization. And I let's combine those two things and give you some real examples. Complexity variances. What does that mean? Let's look at the web experience. We have 32 country sites on 18 top level domains. Think about that.

00:19:36:11 - 00:20:09:56
不明
We're competing. The sites are competing with each other. And on top of that we're updating the content on those sites individually. That creates a lot of work for the central operations team. And then when you're updating things independently, then you start losing that consistency on alignment across those sites. So with that, you know, you're delivering your you there's challenges to traffic and you're also delivering a poor customer experiences because they may not be getting the most up to date content on a specific country site.

00:20:10:01 - 00:20:36:03
不明
Next, we had redundant platforms, multiple bad scan platforms, multiple webinar platforms, and in one instance, one platform with multiple contracts in different regions. See some heads nodding, shaking. Yes, but on that actually is not only is it a cost issue. Right. That's the cost issue. We're we're not we're not buying in bulk. We're not really being efficient.

00:20:36:15 - 00:20:57:00
不明
It's also creating a lot of work for the central IT and marketing teams because we have to support those platforms, and we also have to support all those integrations of that platform to the rest of our marketing tech stack. Some platforms just had low usage of platform. There was just they just had low usage. Our old CDP, John won't name was one of them.

00:20:57:05 - 00:21:24:51
不明
There were some technical limitations with that platform that that kind of drove down that adoption. But really one major thing was we didn't have a strategy on how to actually show the value, the benefits of the platform, get in front of marketers, educate them, train them, and drive adoption. Next, we're talking about platforms that we do have that have a lot of usage where we're not actually using the full capabilities.

00:21:24:56 - 00:21:46:51
不明
We get thousands of leads across our websites and all these landing pages. We have a powerful automation platform, Marketo. Once you start digging in and you look at emails, which a lot of a lot of you probably use, we use a lot. You start seeing a lot of one off campaigns. You're not seeing a lot of triggered campaigns, automated campaigns.

00:21:46:56 - 00:22:09:51
不明
It's not that our marketers don't understand how to do those things. They're pretty smart. It's because we have such a complex business so many ways we operate, not just from a marketing standpoint, how we operate as a company. That makes it challenging to use some of those, capabilities. Lastly, there's a lack of a global analytics dashboard right now.

00:22:09:51 - 00:22:34:59
不明
This isn't to say there wasn't reporting. There are there was tons of reporting reporting everywhere, but they were very specific to a team. They were specific to a business unit. They're specific to a country, to a channel, to an event. And they were spread all over the place. Right. Adobe Analytics powered by Salesforce and of course, Excel. We can't use Google Sheets.

00:22:35:04 - 00:22:56:26
不明
It would be there as well. Probably, but they're everywhere. And so the reporting was great and people were using them. But we didn't have one place where you can look at all the regions, all the business units, all stages of the customer journey, all the channels in one place in a consistent manner. And now Tom is going to highlight some of the opportunities we identified for change.

00:22:56:31 - 00:23:16:00
不明
So a simple yet powerful quote. To get something different you must do something different. And I was reminded during the Coca-Cola CEO's presentation this morning in the keynote when he talked about some, some, product managers and leaders that would come to him and try to convince him that something that's been not working for the last three years, I can fix it.

00:23:16:10 - 00:23:35:25
不明
One more campaign and that it kind of resonated with us. It's something that we've kind of experienced as well, but we knew that we were going to have to do something different. And we have identified these opportunities for change into three different groups technology, process and people. So as far as the tech stack, our CMS platform was nearing the end of its life.

00:23:35:30 - 00:24:02:55
不明
It had some concerns around speed and performance. It wasn't really that well integrated with the rest of our tech stack and our martech tools, and it had a pretty glaring need for standardization and also efficiency. We didn't do a lot of experimentation. We were kind of stuck in this deliver then measure mode. And I've also heard it called the Hope and pray method, and it was a one person team not able to do a whole lot.

00:24:03:00 - 00:24:22:29
不明
And there was really little to no personalization at any level. From workflow management perspective. We had different teams using different tools. I think there were probably 4 or 5 of them being used across the company. It had limited visibility to the stakeholders who cared about some of the timelines, and it lacked integrations to help us move in a much more efficient way.

00:24:22:34 - 00:24:48:27
不明
From an events and sales enablement tools perspective, we had multiple webinar platforms being used, and our sales enablement tools were very disorganized and lacked some basic things like common taxonomy and inconsistencies and naming conventions and things like that. And from an audience management standpoint, we had different regions using different practices and stakeholders using separate tools, and even had different definitions of what our key segments should be.

00:24:48:32 - 00:25:11:44
不明
From a process perspective, standardization was a widespread theme across a lot of different areas. There was no enforcement of common practices. A lot of the teams were working in this idea of silos and kind of doing their own thing, having their own priorities, and we we joked internally that we kind of needed to tame the wild West of people trying to kind of do their own thing and working in the way that they'd been used to in the past.

00:25:11:49 - 00:25:35:01
不明
And governance. This is a widespread theme, again, across lots of different areas, from tagging to analytics, implementation to SEO best practices to cleanup duty and managing things like page inventory. We had, you know, we had multiple pages and areas of the site that were just not very well maintained. And I think maybe even worse, we lacked a lot of accountability to someone that was going to own it.

00:25:35:05 - 00:25:59:40
不明
Content supply chain. We had slow turnaround times in Sla's and we're working in a really inefficient manner. We had it just overall the whole process from campaign generation to getting it alive and production, it was just not optimized for speed nor for scale workflow integrations. We lacked transparency again, in that tracking and this ability to kind of see updates on key timelines for projects that some of our stakeholders were invested in.

00:25:59:45 - 00:26:34:47
不明
We had low usage of automation, and it was really not well integrated with other tools in our stack. And from a journey orchestration standpoint, we lacked a cohesive strategy on cross-channel campaigns and quite honestly, didn't even have the tools in our martech stack. And in our toolkit to be able to actually provide a connected customer journey experience. Lastly, was the idea of the people that the third kind of pillar of change that I referenced, and this was all about kind of changing the way that we thought about our work, and it was all about going toward more of a digital first mindset shift.

00:26:34:51 - 00:27:09:10
不明
What does that look like, bringing data to the forefront of conversations. This is kicking off meetings with results and with data and metrics and kind of making numbers and accountability the way that you operate next is foster a culture of innovation. I kind of alluded to before, we weren't doing a lot of experimentation and putting testing at the forefront of development or, you know, it's kind of a this idea of giving people a platform to try something and not be afraid of failing because we can take advantage of these tools we have that allow us to test in a really low scale, low cost way.

00:27:09:15 - 00:27:28:16
不明
Stay curious to changes in the market. Like I mentioned at the top of this presentation, the digital marketing landscape is changing rapidly and significantly, especially over the last two years. There's this thing called generative AI. You guys might have heard about this morning a couple times and, and but honestly, it's not just something you hear about a conference is anymore.

00:27:28:16 - 00:27:51:07
不明
It's something that's changing the game and it's changing the way we operate. You know, I'm in an optimization and an SEO role, and we're already seeing almost the old way of of using search engines is becoming obsolete. It's becoming much more about conversations. And you can obtain information in a way that's so much different than we used to, where the search engine would just rank most relevant source to at least relevant sources, and you had to find it yourself.

00:27:51:12 - 00:28:18:57
不明
Next is investing not only in technology and in capabilities, but in people and in talent and being really serious about leveling up your organization in terms of what you guys can do and deliver to a customer, but also the people using those tools. This is through things like providing access or subscriptions to learning platforms and providing internal education, sort of, opportunities for people not only about the tech and the tools, but about the humans doing it.

00:28:19:01 - 00:28:44:21
不明
And lastly, one near and dear to me. I actually make my team, put this into their workday system as a goal for the year, which is elevate those around you. And it's this idea about we're not just leading, but we're bringing everyone else with us. And that's proactively educating and helping people that don't know. It's not this like we we hosted a training session once and then everyone's trained or if they don't know how to do it, it's like, oh, well, they were trained.

00:28:44:26 - 00:28:53:40
不明
It's not that it's making sure that people know it's going the extra mile to help and bring everyone else on that whole elevation.

00:28:53:45 - 00:29:14:09
不明
So now we've put together some real examples that we faced. We got five of them. We could probably do a few slides on this, but we picked five of them. And it's all about this idea of connecting those three pillars of change the technology, the process and the people to solve real business challenges that we faced. So first we mentioned that content management system, CMS migration journey.

00:29:14:14 - 00:29:30:54
不明
So really it started with and you'll kind of see a theme across these is we got the key parties. The leaders from the big pyramids in the organization. So in this case it was it was business marketing it was it and product. And we aligned that we need to upgrade this. There's a there's a need for change here.

00:29:30:59 - 00:29:59:18
不明
And then we looked into what do we care about most. What are the capabilities. What are the features that we care about most. And things like speed capabilities and efficiency. Those always surface to the top of those kind of conversations. And we worked together on an evaluation of all the different tools in the market and things that made sense for us as far as cost and as far as integration with the rest of our stack and our vision for the future experience, and ultimately ended up choosing, industry leading technology and Adobe Experience Manager.

00:29:59:23 - 00:30:21:28
不明
Yeah, let me cover domain consolidation. You probably remember I talked about the 30 plus websites, 15 plus top level domains to address this one. The first thing we did was start with data. We looked at all the different websites, the country websites. We looked at, the visits to those websites. We looked at the conversion rates of those websites.

00:30:21:28 - 00:30:44:39
不明
We looked at domain authority scores of those websites. We even looked at how many times those websites had been updated by our web operations team in the last two years. So how old is data? We came to our key stakeholders, our central stakeholders, and we showed them that we could actually actually drive probably more traffic, organic traffic. If we consolidated our websites.

00:30:44:39 - 00:31:06:35
不明
We had fewer websites, we had fewer domains, mainly, we would provide a better customer experience, a consistent customer experience. And those content, the content would be updated continuously, especially if you coupled with the fact that we're moving to Adobe Experience Manager and all the benefits it offers on updating content, and we also showed that we probably wouldn't be.

00:31:06:40 - 00:31:31:44
不明
We did. We were confident we would not be losing any leads. We'd still be generating a lot of leads. Less work, more traffic, you know, pretty much same conversion. Hopefully better. Got buy in from from the central teams. And then in partnership with them we talked to the regional teams. We had some tough conversations. Countries don't necessarily like to lose websites.

00:31:31:48 - 00:32:04:37
不明
They don't like to get merged in with other websites. But after we launch on Am soon, we'll actually be reducing the number of countries we support and significantly reducing the number of top level domains. Next was this idea of the CRO conversion rate optimization program and its growth and its presence in the organization. I mentioned we weren't doing a lot of it before, so we recognized this opportunity for much more experimentation and empowering teams to come to us with ideas and be able to try things.

00:32:04:42 - 00:32:21:18
不明
And really, we actually we actually did POCs with a couple of different, potential technology vendors and identified some really quick wins so that we could go in and we could say, you know, we saw x percent conversion rate lift, and we changed this to this and really started to evangelize and showcase the value of this sort of program.

00:32:21:30 - 00:32:37:02
不明
And I actually did this exact same kind of thing in the retail space and kind of grew, grew one of these sort of programs in the past. So obviously something that I'm passionate about and I really see value in and we've done the same thing at GE, which is really start to kind of grow this whole program and gain a lot of momentum in this space.

00:32:37:07 - 00:32:44:58
不明
And ultimately we ended up choosing the right tool for us and one that we had experience with in the past, which was Adobe Target.

00:32:45:03 - 00:33:17:23
不明
Workflows process 500 almost 800 marketers all over the globe doing a lot of things. And this one we took a little different tactic. Initially, what we showed to our key marketing leaders were the benefits of moving to one unified work management platform. It was like Gnostic of what that platform was initially, but the efficiency gains, how it helped us manage the data and create consistency with the data and connections to other platforms and even how it showed it visualized.

00:33:17:23 - 00:33:39:23
不明
It could help visualize all the campaigns and programs that were running for marketing leaders, and also projects that were in process and at what stage they were. So we got a little tactical, right. Some of the benefits we got there by and got them excited, and then we actually pulled them in to the assessment process, something we don't generally do, but we actually pulled them into the entire process.

00:33:39:28 - 00:34:00:28
不明
They generated a lot of the business requirements. Those use cases. We connected, we worked and we got together and we prioritize those use cases. Then we selected a few vendors and we invited our marketing partners, all of our stakeholders, into those demos so they could ask questions. They could see the functionality live. They scored those demos. They scored.

00:34:00:42 - 00:34:19:52
不明
They gave us an assessment on what how they thought those vendors delivered on their business requirements. Then we came to a consensus. We also factored in cost, but we came into a consensus on the work managed platform that we were going to move forward with, which is Adobe work front with that, because they were part of that process.

00:34:20:07 - 00:34:44:48
不明
They're engaged now. There's a lot of enthusiasm and excitement within the organization because it is going to be a significant change for the company. And lastly, analytics enablement. I think Ronnie alluded to it before, but this was this was a glaring need. We identified for both data and analytics standardization. Think about a global company. There's different teams using Adobe Analytics along with other tools.

00:34:44:53 - 00:35:05:25
不明
They're looking at things differently. There's data privacy implications and different areas of the world that we have to take into account. And everyone was just kind of doing doing their own thing. So we started to I think you mentioned before a little bit, but started to build dashboards and create the standard way so that marketers and business people across the company were looking at things the same way.

00:35:05:30 - 00:35:26:55
不明
We had the same view, we were measuring things the same way. We could all kind of share this common. This is how we're holding ourselves accountable. And this is the benchmark that we set. And now we've also kind of evolved this into actively setting up things like our IT partners do something called an open lab, where people can come in with their own questions and they can say, I need help with this, and somebody from their team can sit with them.

00:35:26:55 - 00:35:44:54
不明
And it's kind of that idea of of elevating those around you and making sure that you're you're proactively helping everyone else elevate with you. So those are our five examples. Yeah. There's there's a few others we could put on here, but those are the main ones that we went through. And Ron is going to take us through how we're doing so far.

00:35:44:59 - 00:36:07:35
不明
Yeah. Credit. I created a report card on three areas where we kind of highlighted, what Tom actually highlighted first is going to be a digital mindset. And after that, in a in a few minutes, we're going to go through process and we're going to talk about tech implementation. So starting with digital mindset. So kind of almost reversible how Tom set up I think we're actually doing pretty well here.

00:36:07:40 - 00:36:45:04
不明
I think marketers are embracing this mindset. More conversations are starting with data. More decisions are being made using data and more. And Tom's team is getting more and more bold. Website experimentation ideas, experiment ideas from our marketing partners. In addition, we're also investing a lot in training our marketers. This last quarter, my team is actually trained all the DG health healthcare marketing teams on writing better AI prompts for prompts for, gen AI.

00:36:45:08 - 00:37:05:16
不明
And it wasn't just a one and done training, something that Tom alluded to. We have an interactive training. And this is that applies to not just AI training, but everything else. We train. We let the marketers go out and use the tool, the platform. We bring people back. Generally in smaller groups, we have discussions. They can ask the trainer questions.

00:37:05:16 - 00:37:23:44
不明
They can ask each other questions, they can learn from each other. They can go. We're also setting up some teams channels and kind of some of these communities of practice across, across the team to again drive home that digital mindset and that training and excitement. I want to kind of stay with digital mindset for a second, Tom.

00:37:23:44 - 00:37:48:00
不明
And one thing I kind of highlighted there is presenting a holistic view. I put that under digital mindset, but you can actually put that across everything. I think mindset, process or implementation. This is where we took all of our platforms, highlighted all of them. What is their role? What do they connect to? Right? How does the data flow from one to another, and how does all of that connect to process?

00:37:48:00 - 00:38:13:54
不明
Right. So now marketers are seeing what we're trying to do long term. You know, they're working on one platform, one tool, not necessarily thinking about how it connects to everything else and how it actually helps. Maybe another marketer, how it helps them. So that's something we've done, and it's really helped people understand all these different projects that we're working on that will drive change process adoption scores a little lower, right.

00:38:13:54 - 00:38:41:29
不明
We got a lot of marketers. We just take work front or recently it's not implemented yet. So it hasn't, you know, we'll solve that problem fully. But for right now we're still doing things to drive improvements in process. We're using the current work management platform. We're tracking how users, who's using it, who's not using it, finding targeted approaches to go talk to some of those people, to incentivize them, to encourage them to actually follow the process.

00:38:41:34 - 00:39:13:37
不明
Right. Instead of just sending out mass emails, everyone follow the process. We're taking a more targeted approach. On top of that, we're also incentivizing some process, improved improvement, and process behaviors. The analytics dashboard that we've referenced a few times, we've aligned with our regional marketing leaders, where they've agreed that the digital marketing analytics dashboards that we've created centrally in partnership with them will be the source, the source of truth regarding the performance of the marketing campaigns of their teams.

00:39:13:42 - 00:39:35:30
不明
Right. That's what those marketers are going to be judged on. What shows up on those dashboards, not the different reports they've been running for for a while that are also fairly good. But these dashboards, what we found is one of the biggest opportunities to get one of the biggest things we had to do to get that data into those dashboards is to change the process to connect all the different platforms.

00:39:35:34 - 00:40:06:35
不明
So requiring marketers to be judged off those dashboards is incentivizing them to follow the process and adapt. The next piece is platform implementation. This doesn't score as high. Now there's kind of two reasons for this. I think. One is we're just doing a lot, to be honest. There's a lot of things that we're doing almost simultaneously. And I know we have amazing IT partners and we have internal teams, but this is just challenging and some of them are a little bit more complex than others.

00:40:06:44 - 00:40:36:11
不明
Some simple, some very complex. The other thing is it's really dependent on the success of some of these programs. And these implementations have depended on how excited we got people up front right? We engaged with them, we understood their needs, we explained the benefits. We generally tend to do better from a platform implementation standpoint. One thing to think about is identifying champions within your organization and across your organization.

00:40:36:16 - 00:41:11:00
不明
That will take what the central team or the implementation team is doing and champion that and across the organization, get everyone excited. One of my peers of Victor, who I think is in the audience today, is doing that with one of her projects. And I think from the early signs are it's actually going pretty well. The last thing I want to kind of talk about, and I think, Tom, you kind of touched on this is the importance of investing in and hiring the right people and also investing in the right support and the right partners, especially for these major platform migrations that you're going to run through.

00:41:11:05 - 00:41:37:15
不明
Take the time upfront, talk to these, implementation partners, ask for contacts at companies that they've worked with before, so you can talk to those people directly done that before. You guys should do that. Take the time, make sure they're familiar with both platforms. Whatever you're migrating between right gets, they have some expertise. And I know cost is important, but let's not start there.

00:41:37:20 - 00:42:01:07
不明
Right. It should be a factor. But look at all the other capabilities and what they'll deliver. And then if you come down to it, you see two partners that are pretty close, then use cost as a tiebreaker. Now, I'm not saying everyone can spend whatever they want or the lowest cost is the worst. By no means. I'm just saying try to focus, have a structured approach to finding your partners and really be thorough about it.

00:42:01:12 - 00:42:16:55
不明
I think the last piece, we're just going to go through some final, final items, right? Yeah. All in all, I'm not that bad a great so yeah yeah. Not not bad. I'll take a room to improve. So lastly we wanted to kind of compile what are the key takeaways that we want the audience to come away from this whole story with.

00:42:16:59 - 00:42:46:18
不明
We got five of them. So we're calling them our digital transfer musts. First of all clearly and consistently communicate the benefits of the change. This is something that might feel redundant. It might feel like you're repeating yourself or saying the same thing to multiple different people, but it's critically important. You got to make sure that you're doing everything that you can, and doing it consistently enough to make sure that you drive home the point that the new way is better than the old way.

00:42:46:23 - 00:43:14:17
不明
Yeah. Understand the connection points between, between people and tools. Right. If you look at if you're regardless of what size organization you are, there is always a handoff between a team within marketing and talking specifically between a team and another team within a platform, another platform map. All those things out. Look at how they integrate and impact each other.

00:43:14:22 - 00:43:41:36
不明
That'll give you a clear view on how everything interacts and how everything will work together. Next is find strong internal partners with influential voices. This is this is also important. It goes a long way. These are these are the people that you vibe with in the office that shared your common purpose. And even better, if there are people in relative positions of power and they can kind of get their voice and their whole team behind your cause and be a really good internal advocate for you.

00:43:41:43 - 00:44:09:20
不明
We've been lucky enough to have some of those. Some of them are in attendance today. And it's it's important because then you've got more than just one voice saying the same thing and reiterating the same point. Leaders need to stay transparent and lead by example. Right leaders are often the faces of change. They can motivate teams. They can also demoralize and just ruin the morale of team.

00:44:09:33 - 00:44:35:22
不明
We all run into challenges on projects, on initiatives. It's how we react. Like how you react will have a huge impact on the outcome of a project or implementation, or overall change within your company. And lastly, know that this takes time. It takes patience and persistence. And of course, the things that we talked about today, you can't change these things overnight, or even in a matter of a few months.

00:44:35:22 - 00:44:53:01
不明
This is likely a year multi-year kind of journey. But stay true, stay true to to the common cause. And I'm sure there'll be tons of people that you know, turn over and different people taking over different aspects of a project along the way, but make sure that you stay the course, because that new way is better than the old way.

00:44:53:06 - 00:45:15:58
不明
So these are our biggest words of wisdom for all of you, our digital transformation musts. And we think that if you take these into consideration, when you go through your own change and transformational journeys, then there'll be no limits to what you can accomplish to explore.

00:45:16:03 - 00:45:16:38
不明
New.
