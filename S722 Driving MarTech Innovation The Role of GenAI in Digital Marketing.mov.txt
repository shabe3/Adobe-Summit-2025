00:00:00:37 - 00:00:29:24

Good afternoon. It's so heartening to see a large set of participants here post-lunch so very, grateful to you for being here. My name is, openness. And, I'm based out of Silicon Valley, just across the street from Robert Crothers. I'm part of Hetzel Tech, and I ran the global commercial business for its tech part of its ecosystem for more than 20, 25 years.

00:00:29:29 - 00:01:02:40
不明
Welcome to the, digital ecosystem. And joining me today is my colleague Shilpa. Introduce us. Yeah. Hi, everyone. I am part of its customer experience practice. I lead all the fun things in customer experience, personalization and AI automation analytics. So we are here today just to speak about few of those topics. I'm sure you've spoken. You've heard a lot about these topics and yesterday, today and tomorrow and we'll try to keep it interactive.

00:01:02:45 - 00:01:27:07
不明
Please feel free to ask questions whenever we are working on any slide that you see fit. Thank you Shilpa. So with that said, we look forward to make it as interactive as possible. Also during the session, both sessions and you know, obviously on a control basis, I think the, the theme of this conference is, it didn't take and, sitting in the Silicon Valley.

00:01:27:17 - 00:02:01:07
不明
I do know how much things are progressing, around the world. And, also when you look at, the interest in this theme and the adoption and early adoption and the degree of, success, the pilot initiatives or, even fully blown initiatives, we are here to share some of these themes. I think the first thing that, we want to start by is, defining what we think is some agent, okay, in the context of, both broadly expressed in the context of digital marketing.

00:02:01:11 - 00:02:25:25
不明
So one is, we do believe that the best use case for is indica obviously lead the front office. So we see them, research, probably 18 months back in all these generic things that are evolving up 70% of the use cases for early Guinea adoption will happen in the front office. So that was very clear to us even 18 months back.

00:02:25:29 - 00:02:50:56
不明
So now as we begin to sort of, tighten the applicability criteria and see where this sort of fits in neatly, we realize the digital marketing space is a space where it is, pregnant with the opportunities. And, it has got a very good upside there. And therefore it becomes important for us to see, how this also fits in overall and where the convergence is happening there.

00:02:51:01 - 00:03:19:26
不明
First is with agent okay. We are seeing that ability to sort of uplift the customer experience goes to exponentially. It happens because partly the it takes control of both the interactions, the processes that sort of come together, plus the ability to take autonomous decisions. So this is real to be seen. We have seen in many, opportunities, at least I would say and half a dozen opportunities.

00:03:19:31 - 00:03:43:47
不明
We can see a factor of norm 5 or 6 times improvement from immediately felt there. And we will explain in terms of, you know, how this all comes together as part of this session itself. And when you're able to sort of enhance that type of experience in the digital platforms, it's going to have Mass Effect to all the, stakeholders who are, experiencing, you know, those, effects of, leveraging the digital platform.

00:03:43:47 - 00:04:26:47
不明
And that is where we believe that the greater upside is and how do we get there? We get there fundamentally because we have four things running in parallel for this agenda. AI is to feel, the degree of versatility and the empowerment it provides to enterprises. First is being contextually aware. And this becomes very, very important. The same agent can work in different and, formats, in different and know functions and depending on the context that we believe is some extremely important, which means that it is highly self-motivated to the opportunity to hand to the context, that we are discussing.

00:04:26:52 - 00:04:48:07
不明
The second is the ability to detect multiple patterns. Sometimes, you know, we tend to go for familiar patterns, but we see that this agent case can look at multiple patterns and clinically look at, the possibilities and rule out or sort of what they could traverse a path which will get the best possible outcome, you know, in the given context.

00:04:48:07 - 00:05:09:41
不明
So that becomes the second differentiation. The third thing is it is multimodal. So it is not going to be something to be incubated in a lab. It has got to face the real life in terms of leveraging everything that is available across channel, across different types of and all opportunities, spaces across different types of multiple agents.

00:05:09:46 - 00:05:38:34
不明
Eventually the overall architecture will mean that we will have multiple agent coming together to drive the enterprise function. Therefore, the ability to sort of move across multiple modes, including leveraging multiple types of elements or multiple types of secured them enterprises. So this becomes one of the secured or trusted networks. So all becomes extremely important to provide the best in class, service to the enterprise.

00:05:38:34 - 00:05:56:22
不明
That is where the multimodality is going to be helpful. And fourth is adaptive learning. It should not be repeating the same thing again and again and again. This is an audio recording device. It has got to keep changing with time. It has to learn. It is a self-learning itself field aspirational drive, better outcomes from our time and again.

00:05:56:27 - 00:06:26:35
不明
So these become very critical as we, begin to sort of incorporate this in the, in the digital marketing space. But none of this will become possible unless there is a vision set out in terms of what to accomplish. For example, should we lift, 1,010 pounds? Should we lift 20 pounds, 50 pounds, 70 pounds? These are all things, that are of directly correlated to the overall vision that we have in terms of what we want to accomplish.

00:06:26:40 - 00:06:52:12
不明
This is where it still takes lots of room for some say, our philosophy in the last, you know, 18 months has been, anchored around a particular framework called Total Experience. What has happened is, we were coming out of the pandemic and post we saw humongous adoption of on our technology process in response happening and the customer expectations and the customer's customer expectations of sufficiently, changed.

00:06:52:17 - 00:07:10:50
不明
And that when we sort of began to do a root cost assessment in terms of, you know, what could we do to sort of make sure that, you know, it becomes very endearing to our customers. What we released when we looked at, across industry, around the world. What we released was there are multiple types of experiences some enterprises take to customers.

00:07:10:54 - 00:07:37:26
不明
Sometimes it can be our customers or any stakeholder for that matter. It can be an employee experience. It can be a customer experience. It can be a user experience, or it can be experience of, different kinds that enterprises provides, to their stakeholders. And also what we realized is when we begin to assess the maturity and adoption levels of each of these, layers of experience, what we release was these were all in different levels of maturity.

00:07:37:31 - 00:07:58:55
不明
Some was probably very good. Somebody were, you know, sort of catching up. So these different strands had its own characteristic. And what we released was the best class. Enterprises began to sort of have an approach where all these multiple strands of experience all sort of come together in a harmonious way to provide a synergistic and, uplift to the overall experience.

00:07:59:00 - 00:08:31:44
不明
The stakeholders can experience. And that becomes the defining norm in terms of the best place to, sum all the digital platforms and to get the best sort of experiences to the customers and therefore, our framework in to enterprises, is essentially anchored around what we call a sum total experience framework when agent K and this, experience, total experience and sort of come together, we are talking about, a tsunami happening there in terms of, you know, the exponential power that both these inherently bring to the table.

00:08:31:49 - 00:08:49:44
不明
And when these combined, we are actually seeing a very humongous upside in terms of, what enterprises going to chew on very shortly. In a matter of few minutes, we will get there to see what are the possibilities. But before going there, I want to make sure that we have a very good view of where to start on agent.

00:08:49:50 - 00:09:13:01
不明
Okay. So sometimes, you know, everybody starts with the end result, the end state in mind. And they want to sort of work backwards, which is very good. But several times it may be, you know, of sort of, punching shorter than one. You can go unless we sort of understand how this all comes together and therefore, set the right vision in terms of where we can actually reach progressively.

00:09:13:06 - 00:09:37:35
不明
So the first thing that we see is, we want to make sure that, like any other firm that comes and goes, you know, that it must be an, there must be an array to sort of anchor any of the, agenda investments in general. And also, we believe that as this this movement has moved at a rapid pace, more the pace of adoption has been much more rapid than what we could imagine basis.

00:09:37:49 - 00:10:05:02
不明
What are we have seen earlier? Trends are now sort of catching up. We are now suddenly come to a stage where it is not really horizontal applications. It is actually becoming more and more vertical based. So we are now seeing in real life, about many vertical, vertical agents that are coming into, into the for, for example, the, the experience from let's say utility customers provide to their customer or they experience, a bank approach to the customer.

00:10:05:03 - 00:10:37:51
不明
They are fundamentally different given the sensitivity of the information there. Therefore, there is vertical ized, agenda agents will become very, very important to sort of, you know, keep in mind when you sort of draft the vision for the enterprise, also, as I mentioned, the ability to sort of, do multimodal becomes very important because the way it is going is you you will be able to bring any, you'll be able to bring any model, you'll be able to build any, reasoning engine, you'll be able to bring any type of trusted network, to sort of come together.

00:10:37:56 - 00:11:02:58
不明
Therefore, this multimodality becomes extremely important. Therefore, when you set out your vision of the agent adoption for enterprise, make sure that, you know, we sort of, factor in this adequately so that you will be able to get the right set of an upside there. And we also realize that, change management becomes very essential because the decision making and the speed of processing will call for an understanding and an adoption.

00:11:03:03 - 00:11:23:06
不明
That is not going to happen in the normal course before change management becomes very essential. Also, the fact that it doesn't mean that we take the human oversight out of that. For example, I was just joking with, a colleague of mine in our own textbook. We invite you to, visit us as well. So we would like to have a digital way of, you know, drawing a caricature.

00:11:23:11 - 00:11:48:16
不明
We really compared the manual process, and somebody is telling me the digital caricature process perhaps had more manual interventions at the back end than what the actual manual caricature carried last year. So that means that, you know, you don't completely take the human out of the equation. There is going to be intervention, what it is, what is the judicious blend of that human intervention with, what it can drive is an art by itself, but we need to make provisions for that.

00:11:48:21 - 00:12:15:25
不明
And also, responsibility consistent with the, the interface standards becomes very essential. All these sort of, can be sort of brought together in a very seamless, efficient, elegant way and is a submission that we want to, bring it to. Also, we see that either we can, at the infrastructure layer or the application layer. But I do believe that, you know, we need to act at both levels to sort of get the best possible, set of returns for the enterprise.

00:12:15:30 - 00:12:44:22
不明
And also, in doing this, I want to quickly talk about, what is it then? Obviously. So because, this basis was suddenly, evolved at a pace that, it is very difficult to put a finger on one thing and say, this is what it is. Therefore, we created, an organization within itself wanted to focus on how the effects are being felt across the world, across enterprises, across geographies, across organizations of varying degrees of maturity.

00:12:44:27 - 00:13:05:34
不明
And what we see was essentially from, total experience standpoint, we see that, you can do either bottom up or top down strategy that it becomes very, very important. So one thing is, you know, these tools are so handy to sort of, you know, essentially, absorb inside the enterprise. So there is a risk factor, it's easily digestible.

00:13:05:34 - 00:13:25:35
不明
Therefore, several organizations sort of take a bottom up approach. But I think there are far sighted organizations which would also love to do top down. But what we realized was the norm. It is too early to say which one is right, but we definitely see these two can seamlessly, come together. And we have seen examples which are going to describe one of that as part of this session itself.

00:13:25:40 - 00:13:47:48
不明
Also, we believe that, from a digital marketing standpoint, into the realm of the domain that we are all interested in. We do believe that, from wall to wall, end to end perspective, there is a efficiency gain of some degree towards an overall, if implemented, elegantly with the plan with, reasonably well settled vision.

00:13:47:48 - 00:14:11:05
不明
So this is the first thing that, I would say is, message that, we want to sort of share authentically out of, our own experiences. And also we believe that it is coming out of three things. One, you got the cost tangle. So we are seeing close to a 50% 50 plus, percentage in terms of an optimization, possibilities and or measured over an 18 month period.

00:14:11:05 - 00:14:29:02
不明
It is not something that you are going to realize from day one or an 18 month period. We are actually seeing, you know, this type of benefit as well, which means that you get that much more money to sort of, you know, as a blow back for additional initiatives, or you can make it a self-funding initiative. So we call it as the break even point where the initiative pays for itself.

00:14:29:07 - 00:14:48:25
不明
And that is a scale that we can possibly get in 18 months. The third is in terms of, is it wide enough? Is there a bucket that is resisting? Is it a bucket that is not of interest rate that doesn't see the value? And we are very, very positively, surprised that we couldn't find many who actually were even willing to try.

00:14:48:30 - 00:15:10:57
不明
So we just closed to the digital marketing community in the leadership and, some of which is present here to absorb these type of changes in a much, much faster. And I think, another thing that has happened is because of, these types of technologies being put in place, the the fundamental way the, customers, customers, stakeholders interact with our customers are completely changed.

00:15:11:01 - 00:15:38:19
不明
So essentially, agents can actually even resolve decisions faster. That means the number of queries that they need to give to the system actually comes from. That is dimension one. Dimension two is because it multimodal. It can sort of support search from different types of, you know, channels. That's the second part. And the third part is because of the way that, Agent Scales have sort of an, a beginning to get at different of, working on issues, half decision.

00:15:38:21 - 00:16:14:47
不明
So it's just that used to go to traditional channels actually getting routed through agent guys. So this is very, very important because the if this is the level of, engagement that we are going to see the stakeholders have, with the customers, with the enterprises, it means that we need to sort of, engineer this very well and have a mechanism to sort of review how this is all performing and also be able to meaningfully capture, at an overall, level, the comprehensive level of impact it's having on, in terms of performance and in terms of, you know, providing, solutions to, stakeholders.

00:16:14:52 - 00:16:48:57
不明
And how do we do that? I think and, what we see is, in all this, the first thing is we need to get the right content creation model. So one of the things that we've seen is in the way that organizations have built up their digital marketing, paraphernalia, we visited the traditional ways of, you know, creating content and setting up the infrastructure to create the content that will to, definitely change will the, the traditional be a funnel putting, structuring, putting that taxonomy, putting that, metadata and tagging everything.

00:16:48:57 - 00:17:11:58
不明
That's all great. That discipline really helps. But the pace of the business is sort of moving on the type of queries this generative a and sort of an essentially solve for customers means that, you know, there is a traditional content, creation mechanism that will probably, how to sort of loosen up a little bit. That's the first thing that we noticed when we saw organizations scale up on this initiatives.

00:17:12:03 - 00:17:39:27
不明
This second is we also release the data as well as the, data about the metadata analysis as well as the the traffic and the transactional data analysis of them. There was always very difficult, therefore, given the scope of what the adjudicators can do, the ability to sort of create synthetic data becomes very essential. Therefore, that is something that we need to invest in before we sort of, you know, go into a full frame, agent, deployments.

00:17:39:31 - 00:17:58:07
不明
Third thing that we noticed was, in the traditional world, we saw the degree of personalization this agent case can bring to customers. It can't be replicated in the traditional world soon that if you don't embrace is the point here is if you do not embrace this, the differences and the delta that we have on these attributes will begin to show up.

00:17:58:07 - 00:18:17:38
不明
Therefore, it's not really about creating the future, but you know, even protecting what we have will become an issue in terms of the impact, we're going to have with the stakeholders. Therefore, it becomes essential to see what are the different attributes on which we will actually see this. See this make a big difference in terms of, adoption.

00:18:17:43 - 00:18:46:24
不明
And the fourth is the product development cycles in terms of, essentially moving from one state of digital marketing to going to the next stage that had a certain cycle that had a certain release management principles, and there are certain frequency, those will substantially change. And we sort of model agent evolve, partly because from the careful steps that we take to make sure that we sort of cater to every admissible scenario is automatically sort of digested by the agenda case.

00:18:46:29 - 00:19:07:49
不明
And then the manual, processes, as well as the limited capabilities in analyzing the data, all will actually, these limiting factors don't apply in the agenda cable or the capabilities. They sort of. So for the end customers actually mean that these limiting factors you need to sort of overcome. So this will become very important as we begin to design your agenda.

00:19:07:49 - 00:19:26:54
不明
Okay. I'm going to leave a lot of time for discussions here. Therefore I want to make it now relatively short in terms of what we want to cover here. So very quickly, I think, how do we sort of go about doing this? Right. So one is, we are now seeing a broad section of an industry use cases.

00:19:26:54 - 00:19:47:38
不明
You know, from a consumer standpoint point in terms of how they can adopt, adjudicate. So this is now almost getting to a codified standard, which means that, there are enough examples, you know, there's enough stuff in terms of what can be accomplished here. So this is something that is actually, right out there. So that is a dimension number one that we need to look into.

00:19:47:43 - 00:20:09:39
不明
Second is we also need to, clearly sequence in terms of, what should what we should prioritize for the early adopters, what should be those, you know, success stories, what should be, the sequence in which, you know, we need to sort of build success, what initiatives success can feed into the next initiative success. So this is something that we need to, differently.

00:20:09:44 - 00:20:34:19
不明
Bake inside the overall, plan that we have, deploying, agent. Okay. Also, the automation use cases to make sure that we are able to sort of, leverage the native core capabilities of K to its fullest extent, which means that we need to redesign the experience, the process, and the platform's ability to sort of drive all we have to sort of come together in doing this.

00:20:34:24 - 00:20:55:43
不明
And one of the tenets, some of the tenets that actually help drive is one is obviously omnichannel is something that we have spoken about, multimodal to take the information as well as to omnichannel or to sort of disseminated information. So that is the first criteria. The second is, you know, we can put customer first as a principle because, there are several resolutions the agent K will to autonomously take.

00:20:55:43 - 00:21:16:40
不明
Therefore, we need to have a certain set of principles codified there. And if that is customer first, therefore it's able to sort of resolve those issues very quickly. Third, I think, in practical terms, I will tell you what it is. For example, if there is a bank trying to employ, agent. Okay, what is in, two metrics?

00:21:16:45 - 00:21:40:53
不明
One is, in the US, particularly the a call for a bank typically costs like, you know, $35. Now, what is seen is when you begin to sort of now do the, agent AI type of, our solution there, we've been able to bring it to something like $4. So this is this is a real number. I'm talking about $35 to $4.

00:21:40:58 - 00:22:13:22
不明
So this is one data. The second data I want to talk about is for example, the credit card. The ability for reconciliation, the complaint dispute resolution mechanisms. What are seeing is in the, in the earlier systems that existed prior to this, it indicates the genesis and the isn't the case. What we have seen is a bank will typically set a limit saying that if somebody were to call and say that I have a dispute, the discretionary power of the manual agent who was operating, that used to be something like an know.

00:22:13:22 - 00:22:35:47
不明
Depending on the bank, it could be $150 or an up to $180. Those will be the limits. Now we are seeing through. Generally, it indicates the confidence level and said the banks are going to be up to 500 to $600. Decisions can be taken in front of the customer. See, this is a big change. And know look at the experience that can actually carry forward to your own customers.

00:22:35:52 - 00:22:56:58
不明
If you if you repeat that across multiple stakeholders, that's the type of change that you're going to see. So it is an order of magnitude improvement. What it is one is the cost is coming down by probably a factor of 5 or 6. And the ability, the confidence in the system is also going up in a substantially. And that's a big change, which is what we call this both innovation and business value driven.

00:22:57:02 - 00:23:18:50
不明
The moment you begin to measure and optimize, you will see the type of and all benefits, outsized benefits that begin to get out of deploying these types of solutions. And in doing this, I want to talk about, well, what are the different stakeholders through which, you know, we can really tie it all together, right? One is we see that, obviously we can do it for your customers.

00:23:18:55 - 00:23:39:35
不明
You can do have partners. Also, what we have seen is the ability to respond. For example, what is the test of a true partner? There are multiple ways I can take this as an example. The test of a true partner is when the partner can actually really stand in for you and provide the same level of experience and expertise and comfort that you do on your own.

00:23:39:40 - 00:23:58:24
不明
Right. So what is preventing that? One is two different organizations, but more importantly, the process, the ability to sort of, you know, take control of a set of activities which you do versus what the partner can do and the ability for the partner to sort of not directly dive into your sort of process for any type of resolution.

00:23:58:29 - 00:24:27:28
不明
So these become a very, very, very, very difficult to accomplish in real world, partly because of the technological barriers that you have. And again, I will sort of break it. I'll give an example here. Some of the Midwest engineering companies, heavy duty Midwest engineering companies, they go and when they go and sell some capital intensive, big machineries, one of the promise that they make is within 36 hours, anywhere in the world, a downturn will be resolved in favor of the customer.

00:24:27:33 - 00:24:48:15
不明
So because we are talking about a paraphernalia that runs for millions of dollars, therefore, this is the type of commitment to know some of the Midwest engineering companies, of typically sort of provide to our customers. Now, all these companies do not have the presence, you know, at every nook and corner. Therefore, they rely on partners several times.

00:24:48:15 - 00:25:10:44
不明
What happens is, in order to fulfill this criteria, the there are if you invoke a partner to go into service, that a partner may go in service there. But what the company is getting in in return is one. Yes. The criteria to sort of get it done in 36 hours is auto fulfill. That is a non-negotiable, but the cost associated with it dramatically goes up.

00:25:10:49 - 00:25:37:25
不明
So it's partly because the partner is not able to sort of, you know, leverage the system that the main principle companies have and that communication gap, that information gap, the data gap is something the agent can plug in very fast, which means that, you know, to provide a seamless, borderless, you know, channel, channel, across the channel experience and in a consistent, repeatable, scalable, reliable way is becoming a clear reality with the agenda.

00:25:37:25 - 00:26:15:26
不明
Okay. So there is a second dimension that we see. The third, the reason why I am saying that is even those larger problems where physical activities are involved, if these can be sort of software agenda in the case of digital marketing, where you typically deal with all the content, information, communication, collaboration, the opportunities abound. And that is the point that we are trying to make here by saying that from a customer journey creation to ability to sort of understand the customer insights and act on those insights and be able to provide a much superior service at a much lower cost and therefore increase the overall experience for the customer, this becomes a distinct reality.

00:26:15:26 - 00:26:44:50
不明
The agent okay world, an example of that we'll actually see in a few minutes from now. The third is we can create multiple models. For example, because of the sophistication and the productivity increases, these technologies can sort of bring to the fore, you'd be able to sort of deploy these solutions much faster and keep experimenting, which means that, you know, you had a fish that you have in terms of what you drive through digital marketing, it can happen at a much faster pace.

00:26:44:55 - 00:27:06:35

And that becomes, very important because this is a world where we look at what the neighbor is doing, we look at what the, enterprise across the road is doing. And that moment sort of sits in and provides a velocity that is going to be very useful for enterprises. So I think therefore, and also do it in a consistent way, which means there are standards and force there, the way that we sort of scale it up.

00:27:06:35 - 00:27:23:59
不明
There is a way that, you know, reliability, sort of, you know, measured there, the way it sort of works with some big data so that the scale up and the rollout can happen in a much more predictable way, which becomes very important for an enterprise, you know, in terms of how they plan their activities, what they promise to their stakeholders.

00:27:24:04 - 00:27:50:08
不明
Having said that, this is, absolutely my last slide before I hand over to, in specific terms, how organizations are embracing, we see that it becomes very important to, map the customer journey here. Sometimes the first principles, the cardinal principles, through which organizations interact with the stakeholders, in this case, the customers should not be, understated just because there is a power of agent.

00:27:50:08 - 00:28:28:21
不明
Okay. There is a brute force through which to would be able to sort of, enumerate to them every different above. That may not mean that the classical approaches that we take towards a customer journey, need to be sort of short circuited. But in fact, these can be reinforced. So that is a clear point here. So the first thing is in terms of the awareness, if you look at, you know, from in the customer journey, being able to create the right type of, personalized, interaction, personalized communication with the customers, our ability to sort of use interact, assistance to, to provide the wider palette of, catalogs that

00:28:28:21 - 00:28:54:30
不明
they can browse, our ability to sort of create, customized, hyper customized, emails or communications or messages to customers or creating the next set of offers for the customer so that it becomes, for example, I do know, global, corporations today, when they want to do, let's say in this case, let's say, quick, quick, QSR, right.

00:28:54:31 - 00:29:21:06
不明
A good restaurant, if they have a mobile, application, we see that even today there is a latency, of a minute, an hour. Supposing they want to do real time offers in the way that these enterprises, like, sort of set up, if they want to say, let's say in Atlanta, there is a there is a pub, I want to at this at this hour, I want to essentially create some offers so that more customers can come into the store.

00:29:21:11 - 00:29:40:38
不明
Today, many of the QSR don't have the ability to do. There is a lag of an hour. Even with all this technology. You have to have your able to operate a data center within the lag of an hour. That's the type of architectural limitation that sort of come in. Therefore, all this can be sort of broken through. Agent Case.

00:29:40:43 - 00:30:03:10
不明
So without much ado, let me invite my colleague of Schulberg to talk about specific terms in terms of how we've done it and throw the floor open for questions for, greater length of time. So, so we just saw here, you know, how marketeers journeys are essentially changing. And when we look at it journey. I changed the market journey in content very quickly.

00:30:03:15 - 00:30:26:19
不明
But what agent is doing? It's changing the entire journey. It allows us to do agents for each step. As well as doing this entire journey automatically or automating it going forward. We see that, you know, from a content or a customer experience, consumer experience perspective. It's not just content, but there's a lot to be done in campaigns or journey orchestration.

00:30:26:19 - 00:30:52:21
不明
There's a lot to be done in personalization, especially in the experimentation and segmentation stage. So what Janela allowed us to just do variations, but in when we bring in agent TKI in experiment, we can actually run automatic experiments, put in the results of those experiments on web pages quickly, as you know, within a day or 2 or 3 without any marketing or interference.

00:30:52:30 - 00:31:26:01
不明
So it actually accelerates every step of the process. That is, they're not just generating content for that experimentation, but actually running experiments and then launching them. When they're successful in analytics, there are multiple multiple applications. We can identify KPIs that we should measure through agents. We can also apply those metrics on the pages for agents. We can then without dependance on reports to be generated and visualized on runtime, these agents can give us the information that we need to the business users.

00:31:26:01 - 00:31:49:24
不明
Not to the analysts, not to the marketeers, but to business users and executives in the language that they understand. So if an executive is looking at it, an agent can do a report in revenue terms, whereas if a marketeer is looking at it, they can do the report impressions, them, whether if analysts are looking at it, they can do the report in KPI terms that they understand which first initially took a person.

00:31:49:24 - 00:32:09:58
不明
And actually preparing these three reports for doing it on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. But now any time anyone can log in and get it in the terms that they need, the real time visibility can be achieved. Same use cases can be applied in commerce, in services, customer support to multiple applications. I think agents are now there.

00:32:10:09 - 00:32:35:21
不明
We've been trying to connect customer support to CGS for a very long time, and we are trying to connect customer data platforms. That's the use cases where it came from. When an agent logs in, they should be able to see where the customer is. But agents allow us to connect that know very quickly there are lesser need for integration, because agents can automate that process and bring in the information to whoever needs it whenever they need it.

00:32:35:26 - 00:33:02:50
不明
Now looking at how to enable this architecturally a lot of products, Adobe, what Adobe is doing now is they are bringing agents within their platforms. But all of us understand that organizations are not just one product. We have so many products out there, we have a data infrastructure there, and we have then multiple marketing products distributed. Along with that, we also have to make decisions on which AI models should best wear.

00:33:02:55 - 00:33:25:56
不明
So we have to decide for every agent that we are using at base, which AI models will they use? Will they use multiple models? How will they connect with one another and then build an agent ecosystem on the top? So you will have an agent for example, for audience management there will be which can be an Adobe into your internal audience management agent.

00:33:26:01 - 00:33:49:42
不明
And then you might have an agent, a customer agent built to move that data over the audiences to the customer service side. So it will be multiple multiple combinations of agents that will need to be built enabled through this data marketing and marketing ecosystem that delivers the end goal, which is as much automation in this entire ecosystem as possible.

00:33:49:47 - 00:34:16:59
不明
Now, whenever we implement something, the question comes how do we measure the effectiveness of it? And as we started, we saw that there are three core user groups for us. The first is the consumers who we are running these programs for. Then the marketeers and then the developers or the users of the platform. So the first measurement for the consumer or the end customers are engagement KPIs.

00:34:16:59 - 00:34:37:02
不明
So we again continue to measure those engagement KPIs because that's how we know whether they are getting personalized experiences. Are the management happening? How long are they staying with us, how much time they're spending with us? How much satisfaction do they have? But for marketeers, the KPIs are different. We move to more performance based KPIs. What is our time to launch?

00:34:37:12 - 00:35:00:33
不明
If we took a week to launch a campaign, or can we do it within a day? Can we do it less or what is our overall marketing ROI? Did we invest in the agent or a experimentation agent? How quickly? How many experiments did we run? What was the ROI on it? Did it actually impact our revenues? And then very important content velocity, all this personalization need all this content.

00:35:00:33 - 00:35:22:00
不明
So how quickly can we generate that content. How quickly when can we get it out? What was how many pieces of content were generated within a day, within a minute or any time? Then the thought is the same KPIs cannot be applied to our developers on the platform users. So they have operational KPIs. We need to see how did the application, after putting in the agent performed?

00:35:22:00 - 00:35:40:31
不明
How many bugs did we get? How many tickets did we get? How many issues did we get? How much time or effort did it take to solve them? So application performance becomes important. Code quality becomes important because we need to trace it. We can't just keep putting out code there over code, over code, over code without traceability being there.

00:35:40:36 - 00:36:03:29
不明
And then test velocity. How quickly are we testing the code that was put in? Even if it's agents, how are we any getting any efficiency out of that. So we have to understand that even if it's agent, we have to have different KPIs for different types of agents that we are deploying. We can't just have engagement KPIs and measure them and see all.

00:36:03:34 - 00:36:17:19
不明
If we are doing more impressions, we are running more campaigns. That's good enough. We have to look at all other KPIs as well and cool down at the user level to look at them.

00:36:17:24 - 00:36:52:09
不明
Now, just to understand and just go back here. So essentially, these are just some examples where we are already doing AI. And if you see there is a big spread here in terms of both B2C, B2C organizations going into agent and already adopting these use cases, we are also seeing that this is across verticals. So these agents are not limited to just B2C retail use cases or simple use cases, complex use cases within organizations like Flow Sciences Healthcare.

00:36:52:09 - 00:37:21:24
不明
Because compliance is a very big place where agents are playing a part because they want to automate those processes, then financial services with a lot of regulations, they are looking at, you know, bringing in agents to help their customer service to onboard customers quickly because the processes are so repetitive. So all areas that we have here, we are actually seeing adoption of agents coming in.

00:37:21:29 - 00:37:52:59
不明
And these are some other use cases where we implemented, AI to essentially starting from generation of content, selecting of segments, marketing to those segments, measuring performance. And we've seen of up to 40% efficiency gains in terms of bringing in more revenue. We've also seen amazing, you know, time improvement in time to modernization. And about 80% reduction in content generation efforts.

00:37:53:06 - 00:38:15:49
不明
So if we do it right, we identify the use cases correctly. If we see, you know, where we can bring in and connect these use cases together, there's multiple multiple benefits for all involved. Yeah, right. Thank you everyone for attending the session. And if you want to spend.
