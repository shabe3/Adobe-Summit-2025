00:00:02:52 - 00:00:36:58

Over the next decade, organizations will face huge challenges as industries are reconfigured. Sector boundaries blur and competition heats up. Business as usual is not an option for companies that want to shift from surviving to thriving. Leaders can't stand the flow of uncertainty. They must act now to channel disruptive forces and reinvent their business models. Top companies are already doing this, fundamentally reshaping how they create, deliver and capture value.

00:00:37:03 - 00:01:10:57
不明
Like a car manufacturer using its customer data to build a predictive maintenance platform, or a retailer sharing its supply chain capabilities by licensing its technology to other organizations through a subscription model. Leading companies are alert to market triggers, trends, and emerging technology. They listen to existing customers while attracting new ones, like a digital bank selling its core technologies and knowledge to other financial service providers so they can build new digital products and apps.

00:01:11:02 - 00:01:56:55

Business model. Reinvent has challenge the status quo to grab opportunities like a coal fired power plant, helping companies install solar panels on their sites and creating a new business managing these assets. When Reinvent has moved, they move at speed, adopting a minimum viable product approach to test and learn before scaling up fast. Most organizations will face huge industry reconfiguration challenges in the next decade, but those that act today to start reinventing their business models by piloting new innovations will be around tomorrow to enjoy success and seize the future.

00:01:57:00 - 00:02:30:34

All right, so people typically have Linkin Park or somebody else's hype music. I had the BWC video for that. So, welcome everybody. Thank you for joining us. My name is Simran Sharma. I shepherd the marketing function here at BWC. I'm a recovering, strategist, having worked with some of the folks in the room over the past several years and helping companies kind of reimagine, reinvent, their business models.

00:02:30:39 - 00:02:55:16
不明
And, actually, quite honestly, I don't know if any of you were at the keynote. I couldn't have asked for a better set up for this session than Shantanu and James Quincey when they talked about the need for reinvention, in our business. So we have a very action packed agenda. We're going to go through 7000 slides, all font size five.

00:02:55:21 - 00:03:39:24
不明
So please take notes and take them quickly. But all kidding aside. We're going to talk through three things today. On a panel, one. Why why are we talking about reinvention? Right. We'll talk a little bit about what the triggers, what each and every one of us is experiencing. Two how how do we learn from others to kind of how to kind of leverage or kind of look at this reinvention, not just as a threat, but as an opportunity for our organizations and for us to go and do great things and kind of really transform the marketing and customer function into a growth and value creation function.

00:03:39:28 - 00:04:11:01
不明
And three, the part the most excited about is Will. We'll meet some luminaries in this in our industry who've been at the cutting edge of helping organizations like yours, like ours. Think about reinvention. Think about how to drive growth, think and then actually impact that growth and that organizations. So this is a very simple we're not 7000 slides aside.

00:04:11:06 - 00:04:33:41
不明
The idea is to have a simple conversation. I will start with some prepared comments because we've had today's session is a combination of some research, proprietary research we've done, but also an article we published in, Harvard Business Review in, in the, in the winter. It was a cover article on growth. Right.

00:04:33:41 - 00:04:57:31
不明
And how to companies how should companies be looking at, driving growth, sustained growth, through reinvention. And then we'll kind of open it up. That sounds like an agenda. The other thing is, as we have the panel, as we have the discussion, this is a conversation we're having amongst friends. So yes, I have a few prepared questions, which have been crowdsourced.

00:04:57:36 - 00:05:22:25
不明
But if you have a question, ask us a question. Make sure you ask them the hardest questions. The easy ones come to me. All right. So let's, they talk about this as gamification always helps engagement. So let's start with a little bit of trivia. Right. And let's make it real. So if you. Well, if you go to the next slide, which would be my responsibility.

00:05:22:30 - 00:05:47:30
不明
So let's start with a question. Right. So let's talk about some real examples. So Hasbro. Mr. Potato had monopoly etc.. We all know Hasbro right? But the question here is, before they kind of became famous for their board games action figures, what business do you think they started off with? They going old school so you can put a hat what you like.

00:05:47:31 - 00:06:17:16
不明
You can shout it out in Texas b c d. Saddle and harness making seems to be the consensus over here. All right. Let's see if you're right. Actually, no, it was a person who called out textiles who was spot on. Right. So Hasbro actually, it's a fascinating story, actually. It's a story of how a company can be so customer obsessed that they understand where the fuck is going.

00:06:17:16 - 00:06:45:51
不明
And they actually started in textiles and they would provide textile, cuttings for pencil boxes. And the very soon realized, actually, there was a demand and a need from children for something other than just, you know, different toys, a different kind of creative. So they created this product portfolio of, of of toys, and for the last, for the next 78 years can really have been a force in the in the toy manufacturing, space.

00:06:45:55 - 00:07:11:13
不明
And now they actually taking a next pivot. They're actually in the throes right now of launching a set of digital channels. Right. They have about 20 million active users now on that digital channel that they expect to have 50 million active users where they're going to actually they're basically following the consumer, today's children, today's young adults actually engaged not through physical kind of, products, but through digital products and channels.

00:07:11:27 - 00:07:37:48
不明
Right. Fascinating story over there of reinvention. All right. Let's have you guys now have a hang of it. There's no wrong answer. Actually, there is a wrong way. Wrong answers. But let's go to the next one. All right. So, Tiffany's Tiffany and company. We all know about Tiffany's. Where do you think they started up?

00:07:37:53 - 00:08:08:08
不明
Don't be shy. I thought it was. Laughs but that's not a choice. That's that's a very inventive answer going off. All right. See? See. Stationery. And you think anybody else a musical instruments. All right. Now we have every answer that I. But stationery is right. They started off as stationers and actually they've had a you know, Tiffany's has been around for.

00:08:08:13 - 00:08:30:55
不明
I'm going to butcher but almost 200 years they started off in stationers. And then they kind of, and it's actually a very well published story that, you know, the kids of the original founder, they had a store in New York City. They send one of the kids to Europe where they saw, actually, hey, the same high net worth individuals that they were targeting with the stationery.

00:08:30:55 - 00:08:59:15
不明
You actually also wanted lamps and other other things, and then they can introduce that. Then they kind of set up a retail arm on Broadway, which is their iconic Tiffany store, which, you know, Fast forward has now become this really iconic blue box, kind of, aspirational luxury brand. Right. Again, and a great example of, of reinvention.

00:08:59:20 - 00:09:19:50
不明
All right. We're going to take a quick couple of quick ones again. All right. So this one was particularly interesting. Samsung. Everyone knows Samsung I hope so. Where do you guys think Samsung started. We'll see. See I hear any takers for a bird?

00:09:19:55 - 00:10:00:52
不明
Don't be shy. Okay. All right. See, actually, it is not. See? That's not. They started off with trading and dried fish. Right. And it wasn't until the 1960s that they saw this trend in kind of manufacturing of high tech equipment, etc., which then they kind of, you know, Samsung, the Samsung. Right. So I think we all know. So another great example of really being ruthlessly focused and understanding where the puck is going, what customers want, and then innovating and entering those businesses to stay relevant, etc..

00:10:00:57 - 00:10:56:44
不明
We'll do one final one, you guys game for another one. All right. Confidence is key. All right. So, in store lounges. So which retailer introduced retail? Sorry, this concept of in-store lounges during the Great Depression. See, you see Neiman Marcus de Cartier. Actually, you guys are correct. It is Neiman Marcus. And they realized this during the Great Depression that if they had to attract the high net worth shopper, they wanted to kind of trance form from just a retail outlet to a place where they actually wanted to an experience, and that's what their customers were seeking.

00:10:56:49 - 00:11:21:03
不明
Right. And you're seeing the next reinvention of Neiman and Saks as they're coming together and stuff, really kind of bringing that whole customer experience lens to digital, right? Really following where the customer is. All right. I'm sure we can go through the next 30 minutes of, you know, trivia, but, you guys are a demanding audience. So we will kind of pivot to, the promised agenda.

00:11:21:16 - 00:12:03:47
不明
All right. So I thought I said, we're going to talk about the why. Why are we even here? We're here because he runs, a CEO survey, an annual CEO survey. And we've been doing that for several years. And we started asking CEOs about where do they believe their business will be relevant in the next decade. 45% of CEOs, these are your CEOs, 45% of CEOs believe that their businesses will not be relevant and competitive if they do not change, and they do not reinvent their business.

00:12:03:52 - 00:12:37:01
不明
And what is particularly startling is the fact that that number was just 39%, two years ago. Right. This gets even more interesting, by the way. All right. Many of you senior executives, 52% of you mentioned that creating new revenue streams in the next three years is a top priority, right? We all know everyone's looking for growth. Everyone's looking for innovative ways to drive growth.

00:12:37:06 - 00:13:14:57
不明
Not surprising. All right. 63% of CEOs then said, hey, we actually are in the process, have taken some action towards reinventing our business. But when you when you compare that intent with actual outcome, only 7% of, revenue from from the public company database actually is really attributed to new businesses or new innovations, etc.. So, you know, we clearly the aspiration intent is there, but it's kind of falling short.

00:13:15:01 - 00:13:45:29
不明
And then finally, while the CEOs were somewhat pessimistic about the future, all of you are even more pessimistic about the future. If we do not do something, 76% of you said that if we do not, if our company does not change how we kind of operate, we would be out of business. All right. So what's driving that? Right.

00:13:45:34 - 00:14:13:25
不明
There are a few different trends. Again, I would love to hear if you agree or disagree. Right. Technology I will not get paid if I don't use the use the term I in this conversation. So check to whoever's taking notes. But I is clearly one of the most disruptive technological phenomenons of our generation. Right. We'll talk a little bit more about that as we get into the panel.

00:14:13:30 - 00:14:35:37
不明
Right. Hopefully everybody agrees. Consumer preferences, you and I, you know, this whole archaic approach, a B2C, B2B at the end of this B2B, it's it's a business to people business that we are all in. Right. And how we our expectations and our preferences are changing are evolving. An example over here is like and I'm I want to kind of connect a few dots here.

00:14:35:37 - 00:15:00:00
不明
Right. One of the examples we use this whole GLP one phenomena. Yes, 8% of Americans are using GLP, but 35% of Americans are actually considering GLP one. So what does that do if you're a hotel chain right, a high end hotel chain now, it's no longer okay to have high end luxury retail over there or have a steakhouse.

00:15:00:05 - 00:15:30:31
不明
You want to have healthy food. You want athleisure, outlets over there. You want to offer better, healthier lifestyle solutions and products over there. So while it's a food phenomena, it is impacting not only health care, but it's also impacting other downstream upstream kind of places where you and I engage on a day to day basis. The other one, regulatory hopefully we all agree, doesn't matter on which side of the aisle you are.

00:15:30:36 - 00:15:59:55
不明
We are in a regulatory kind of, how do I put it? We're in a regulatory intense environment, either regulations easing up or regulations amping up in some different places. Right. So that will drive in some ways how we as companies, whether we are a telecom company or whether we are a food company or whether we are, you know, in whichever space how we need to kind of operate very differently.

00:16:00:00 - 00:16:21:00
不明
We are hopefully in all in agreement. The best thing a consultant can do is put up a page with everybody just nods and says, that sounds right. All right. And then there's some emerging trends, right? I'll skip the tariffs and stuff because that just tends to be controversial. But let me talk about some of the other things.

00:16:21:05 - 00:16:46:35
不明
Ecosystems. James Quincey talked about the fact that they are an ecosystem. Coca-Cola is an ecosystem orchestrator, right. Our research shows when you actually go and partner with other ecosystem partners, an Adobe with a Microsoft or an Adobe with an AWS or a Salesforce, etc., you create more value, you create more shareholder value, very tangible value creation, right?

00:16:46:49 - 00:17:09:16
不明
And therefore you're seeing these future trends of more ecosystem players from a technology, but also from an experience perspective. Right. Actually, another great example is how, Delta Airlines, I was at CBS. I remember how they're teaming up with Uber, they teaming up with other platforms, etc. to be able to deliver the customer one unified customer experience to their customers.

00:17:09:16 - 00:17:36:04
不明
Right. As an example, social commerce. I don't know about you. In my household we have snap, we have TikTok, we have Instagram. I think we are too young for Facebook anymore. Nobody from meta, obviously, but, we interact with social media, search stats and social estate search stats and commerce. So there's a unified path, right?

00:17:36:09 - 00:18:00:34
不明
Many of you have or your children or your, siblings have transacted commerce on a snap, on a TikTok, on a WhatsApp. Right. And that whole integration is what's going to offer the customer unified customer experience is what's going to drive that. Again, I mean, very purposeful of not looking at B2C, a B2B and B2C, B2B, quite honestly, that delineation should not exist.

00:18:00:35 - 00:18:22:17
不明
It's a business to people, business that all of us are in. Finally, AI powered automated agents. I will defer that also to the panel, because I think we have some great perspectives of leaders who are actually impacting that and thinking about how they're driving that across their organization. But hopefully, Shantanu again, an insight analyst, Arnold did a great job for that.

00:18:22:17 - 00:18:46:27
不明
So hopefully we we agree that that's an emerging trend and we as a business need to kind of, address them. All right. So I talked about the Y right. Nobody had any violent disagreements. So let's get to the how. So this is at a set. The source over here is the article we published in HBR. On on growth.

00:18:46:31 - 00:19:09:38
不明
And there are a few things we looked at over 2000 public companies. We looked at their growth profile over the last five years. And we looked at of course, if you just look at over a five year period, you look at the absolute of it. We found in the top quartile of that, there were many companies who may have had episodic growth.

00:19:09:43 - 00:19:30:00
不明
Right? They grew really, exponentially in one year. But then they kind of plateaued the next year, then again grew. So we we kind of looked at that sample and say, hey, which companies had sustained growth every quarter? They demonstrated growth. Right. And then we looked at so we call them the growth leaders, right. And it was fascinating.

00:19:30:00 - 00:19:49:34
不明
In fact, Adobe was one of them. That's part of the reason we wanted to have this conversation here, because Adobe was definitely one of them. The others over there as well, and we tried to study, is like any good consultants would. We tried to study what was driving that so we can pull nuggets from that to understand how it all right.

00:19:49:39 - 00:20:35:30
不明
We discovered one companies that actually had sustained growth. The growth champions. We outperformed the rest of the industry. This is enterprise value to revenue ratio. So they had a four point x. Well actually they was a 1.7 x expansion over that five years. Then the rest of the industry. Right. So when you have a sustained predictable growth algorithm that delivers your stakeholders and I consciously mention stakeholders, not just shareholders, not just employees, but the communities that you operate reward you for that.

00:20:35:34 - 00:21:21:56
不明
Questions, thoughts? Actually hold them till the panel comes. All right. So we talked about the why. Now let's talk about the how they were five things we discovered when we studied these companies that they did better than everybody else. Right. They were obsessed with having a view on what outcome is the driving for their customers. They were, they were ruthlessly focused on understanding what are those capabilities that allow them to deliver competitive advantage, and what are the capabilities that they needed to manage for cost.

00:21:22:01 - 00:21:46:25
不明
Again, James mentioned that very elegantly. In the core context, Coca-Cola is a great example. They are all about brand customer, intimacy. Customer for them is the Walmarts and the Amazons and three the franchise leader. Should they manage a franchise, a bottling systems who do all the manufacturing, everything else managed for efficiency and cost? They don't need to own it.

00:21:46:30 - 00:22:09:24
不明
A great example of them being focused on the capabilities that matter and building capabilities to enable that. The right operating model. Making sure you have an operating model that is connected in the right way, that can deliver the outcomes that you need to kind of deliver to the customers that you're focusing on, right. Great examples around that. Renewing insights.

00:22:09:28 - 00:22:31:54
不明
I call it privilege insight. A great example in this context is Ikea. Do you know how Ikea has two fundamental, one fundamental models that they provide the cost of their product and the price of the product has to come down year on year. And how do they do that? They actually have such they built such trust with you and me as customers that they have cameras in their consumer space.

00:22:31:58 - 00:22:59:58
不明
They're seeing how you and I live every day and then they optimize. Are they? Sorry, that's a consulting. What? I will kill it, I promise. I said no consulting words. All right. They kind of refine or improve their product design, their product esthetics, product kind of material, etc. every single year through those privilege insights that they drive, we talk about the integration of journeys and AI and data that are not talked about, that is in service of being able to drive that privilege insight.

00:23:00:03 - 00:23:30:36
不明
Because unless we know our customers better than anybody else, we will always be following somebody else's lead versus us leading and shaping, the, the demand narrative. Finally, measuring the return on investment. Let's face it, in today's date, if you want to modernize your capabilities, you want to fund your growth. You got to find the productivity to be to be able to do that.

00:23:30:41 - 00:23:55:14
不明
It is. Nobody's signing a free check as a CMO, as CXO, as its chief revenue officer. You need to be very clear about what you're driving and how you're going to fund it. And that's where the power of AI, the power of kind of platforms like Adobe come into play because they drive ruthless, efficiency and remove complexity.

00:23:55:19 - 00:24:21:07
不明
For us to be able to do that. Right. All right. That is a great tee up for me to invite the real stars of today's show. That is my 15 seconds of fame, which I think just got done. All right. So I'm going to invite them one by one. If you want to give a standing a round of applause, you want to whistle, etc., go for it.

00:24:21:12 - 00:24:55:46
不明
Right. So I'll introduce Nick, Nick, Pamela, a dear friend. Nick is the, is leader of the National Advertisers Association, the premier marketing organization. Also leads the global CMO Growth Council. Right. I suspect most of your CMO, if you're not already a CMO, are members of the CMO Growth Council. So let me invite Nick to the panel.

00:24:55:51 - 00:25:26:57
不明
I use a randomizer because we were trying to say we will pull the best looking person at the end, and there was a real kind of fight over that. Next up, is anything Nathan is a technology leader, a real change maker. And what I love about what he the way he focuses on his business, it's all about he sees technology as a value creation lever within the organization versus the traditional approach of looking at technology as a risk mitigate, or a cost center.

00:25:27:01 - 00:25:36:43
不明
So, Nick. Sorry, Nathan. The huia from Verizon.

00:25:36:48 - 00:26:05:29
不明
All right. The third one I'm tremendously proud of being able to invite Max is let me do the formal invitation that I'll give you. So Max is, is the global leader of Adobe's marketing center of excellence, a marketer amongst marketers. You know, if you're marketing Adobe, you actually have to be really kind of kick ass. I'm glad he is, because he learned while he was working with me, we we started in consulting together, and he obviously was the brighter one.

00:26:05:29 - 00:26:16:01
不明
So he left and went on to bigger and better things. But, give a hand to Max square.

00:26:16:06 - 00:26:44:06
不明
And last definitely not the least, Karthik. Karthik is another, phenomenal, phenomenal partner. He is, the, the the Whisperer. To all the CMO and CEOs in the consumer market space, he is the head of strategy, the managing director, strategy lead and go to market leader for Adobe consumer market business and, and, retiring.

00:26:44:11 - 00:26:55:55
不明
Sorry, a recovering consultant and a digital leader, at Nike. Right. Previously. Karthik, welcome.

00:26:56:00 - 00:27:23:38
不明
All right. So, All right, let's get this party started. Hopefully the microphones are on. Awesome. Hello. So, maybe the first question, Nick to you. I'll give this to, the first question to you, Nick. So we talked about a lot of, you know, you are you work with CMS every day. You kind of you you created the CMS Growth Council are talking about the biggest pain points, etc..

00:27:23:38 - 00:27:49:30
不明
So what what are some of the things that, trouble the CMS today that they're prioritizing? How long do we have? I think it's, so I, I lead a group or it's a fancy way of saying, herding a bunch of, cats. It's the CMO Growth Council, and it's about 1100 CMO from, you know, I guess it's called client side, marketers.

00:27:49:30 - 00:28:14:39
不明
And, together, we're tackling the issues that no one individual can tackle, no matter what resources they have or don't have. And, I guess, good thing for job security, there are a, there are a lot of matters that have come up that are priorities. And we meet quarterly to, to reprioritize. And, you know, what is the most important thing that we need to do now for us, you know, for our teams.

00:28:14:43 - 00:28:32:27
不明
But then you know, what's around the corner. And, that keeps changing like quarter, the quarter, which is, which is crazy. So that's the number one thing right there is just sort of like keeping up. They need to know only what is important for them to make decisions now and for tomorrow. But they need a lot of help.

00:28:32:27 - 00:28:50:33
不明
And so that's actually why I'm here. I've been to an Adobe Summit, like I was saying, since it was in Park City, Utah. Big difference, by the way, Utah versus Vegas in the, in the vibe. But still nevertheless, I think what the difference was, between then and now is that the industry has sort of, come here.

00:28:50:43 - 00:29:13:49
不明
I think this is essential for marketers. This isn't just a creativity thing, a designer thing, a coder thing. This is a a marketer thing and marketer meeting. It's an enterprise wide function and all of what you heard, you know, yesterday and today on stage. And what's going to continue is that marketing is like an experience function. So when you say it's an experience function, that means it's an enterprise wide function.

00:29:13:49 - 00:29:42:00
不明
So now marketing is too important to be left to just the marketing department and doing ads. That's the most important thing, is rethinking the marketing function to be an enterprise wide function where they are still orchestrating and making sure that data and insights flow through the veins of the organization. And right now, it's not happening. I'll say probably on a scale of 1 to 10, it's like a three on average.

00:29:42:05 - 00:29:59:52
不明
With respect to all the different CMO, from the different brands. And there's the top brands in the world in that group. And so they need a lot of help there. And so that's what's on their minds is how do they actually not get in front of it, just figure out actually like what it is. So it's interesting you went to tech and data.

00:29:59:52 - 00:30:28:04
不明
So maybe I was going to go to our Adobe, luminaries, but maybe I'll go to Nathan instead first. So Nathan. So we talked about a bunch of technology, technological changes. You heard Nick talk about the need for the right data, the right technology, etc.. As a technology leader, as a partner, at Verizon, but just in general, curious about how you look at this, thing.

00:30:28:04 - 00:30:56:46
不明
How do you respond to that and how do you, kind of guide your, marketing partners in crime on how to go about that in transformation and journey? Yeah. First of all, thank you for the opportunity to be here. So I think, you know, when we look at, you know, harnessing the super power of a genetic AI or, you know, generative AI or AI at scale, you know, we think of it, you know, partly from, you know, from a stakeholder ecosystem standpoint, like, what is it that really matters to them?

00:30:56:51 - 00:31:19:15
不明
When we look at the marketing ecosystem and the marketers today, I mean, their lives have become very operational and boring, to be honest with you, because they have no control. They have to orchestrate work across so many partners and internal, you know, groups. And the the burden of operational tasks has significantly increased for them. So I think when we think about agenda, I mean, it is directly a solution to that problem.

00:31:19:15 - 00:31:42:45
不明
It's like the medicine to their pain. And, and has a great promise, for them to go back to being strategists for the organization, you know, shift from operational tasks to high value strategic tasks. So clearly there's an unlock for them there. Now, when we think about, as a, as a technology organization, as a catalyst of change, right, our role is how do we drive value from those investments?

00:31:42:50 - 00:32:04:45
不明
You know, one of the things that we, we feel very proud of and, I think I feel very strongly about that personally as well, is a lot of technology leaders in the business live in a bubble of, hey, we're the best at engineering. You know, our code works perfectly at architecture works perfectly. But I think the emphasis needs to be we have to be value champions for the business, not just technical champions.

00:32:04:49 - 00:32:30:37
不明
And that's a muscle that you have to build over time. And that muscle comes handy no matter whether you're trying to find, you know, use cases for AI and drive AI transformation or, you know, the previous generation or the next generation. I think that's part of the the muscle that we have to build. The third thing I would say is as, as a leader who manages a big technology ecosystem, we have to be healthy as a technology ecosystem as well.

00:32:30:37 - 00:32:56:15
不明
And tech health has its own parameters, right. How lean is your technology ecosystem? How well are you utilizing your platforms, how well integrated they are when we talk about data, right. If you have to push data through an ecosystem of 80 to 100 tech partners, I mean, that's a challenge in itself. So we we've learned, you know, that it's very important for us to have tech, fitness, and we define tech fitness in in different ways.

00:32:56:15 - 00:33:13:57
不明
One is, you know, very strong and robust. What I was a tech governance practice, looking at our partners, looking at utilization, looking at rationalization and a maniacal focus on that. And it's very interesting because a lot of times, you know, the next big thing, the next shiny object is expensive and you don't have money in your pocket.

00:33:14:02 - 00:33:36:51
不明
But if you have a strong technology governance function, you will realize that it's very easy to self-fund from those efficiencies. And finance partners love that because I'm going them with us to them with a solution and not a problem. The other thing I also think is very important is speed to innovation. So speed of innovation is very important because all the stuff that's coming at us, how fast can we bring it in our labs?

00:33:36:55 - 00:33:55:19
不明
How fast can we go live? With with some of these capability in how fast can we how effectively can we benchmark this? You know, what we've learned in AI. And a lot of this I work is, you know, it's very easy and, to go to the first launch, but the first launch is mostly not the, the, the ROI creator.

00:33:55:31 - 00:34:16:30
不明
You have to continuously optimize. So we also believe in, test and learn being part of your tech DNA and going back to the tech fitness aspect is your ecosystem set up so that you can measure those incremental values. You can put those tests in, in effect, and understand the other way. So anything you had me at market as a board.

00:34:16:42 - 00:34:41:09
不明
So maybe let me pivot to the, the marketer who I know can never be bored. So, Max so what what's what most excites you as you look at the next 12, 18 months? Like, where are you as a marketer? Kind of looking to drive innovation, to create the competitive advantage and kind of to drive growth? I'm going to riff a little bit on there, Jim.

00:34:41:09 - 00:35:00:28
不明
So, so I've had three chapters to my career. I've been a management consultant. I've had a marketing chapter, which I'm returning to now. And then I was, a chief data officer for a large company for HP. So I've looked at it from a couple of different ways. But I wanted to just go back for a minute to, like, the why?

00:35:00:28 - 00:35:20:58
不明
This is, like, kind of important. And it was an after lunch session, but, you know, it took it is about 42 years old. All right. The average age of a company right now is about 20 years, and it's projected to come down by 2027 to about 12 years. Back in 1950, of contrast, the average age of a company was 61 years.

00:35:21:03 - 00:35:42:29
不明
This is some other consulting research, but I just, you know, I, thought it would be helpful to add a little color, like, so, like the world is moving really fast. And, you know, it's a milestone that if it took Adobe was 42 years old, 21 years to make about $1 billion. And then in the next 20 years, it added another 20.

00:35:42:34 - 00:36:01:52
不明
Right. You sort of have to lean in or not, but you have to have a bias for action. So back to some of the themes here. What I'm excited about is, you know, I've worked in a couple of places, so I've had the advantage of looking across at how kind of marketing works. And I think there's just really two types of, possible futures for marketing.

00:36:01:56 - 00:36:23:04
不明
You can be a cost center or you can be a strategy leader. And I think if you're a strategy leader, you need to be, a strategy leader by leading in and adopting not just small scale kind of AI experiments, but really, how do you lead the way through data federation, through large scale application of AI? That is actually the sweet spot that Adobe is in.

00:36:23:09 - 00:36:37:59
不明
So I know we all have a reticence to thinking about, well, how does I work with my organization as an example. And I that further to that, that this one is not like the last one. So, you know, we used to talk about digital and as one of our colleagues wrote, right. Digital's a turn. It's 33 years old.

00:36:38:04 - 00:37:07:58
不明
And, you know, we're still like digitizing AI is going to happen like wildfire. You know, it is it is here. It is now. The scale is large. It's time to move beyond experiments. That excites me. The biggest challenge is how to unlock, not just stay high as a methodology and a tool, but how do you use data combined with AI in an incredible data rich part of an average company, which is a marketing function, to really lead the way in how the company thinks about the future product innovation, and the like.

00:37:07:58 - 00:37:34:25
不明
And I think that the time is now. The time is a little scary, but you've got to absolutely, lean in. And Adobe's at the cutting edge of having those conversations with customers. And in fact, having those conversations internally about what the human plus AI future looks like. And I think that's why we're successful, continue to grow 42 year old company in a world where the average company lives and dies in a much shorter lifespan, that's well set.

00:37:34:30 - 00:38:03:23
不明
But that's also great tip for my next question to Kartik, because we talked about technology. We talked about the need for marketing be about being a value creation function. You talked about the role of AI and completely transforming like wildfire. So, Karthik, you talked to a range of CXOs, right? And they're always asking about, hey, we get that we need to reinvent, but how do I kind of drive the value.

00:38:03:23 - 00:38:25:05
不明
Like how do you so curious about how you connect maybe in the context of Adobe, like how you connect the value equation to the transformation equation to create that sustained growth agenda for them? First of all, thank you for inviting me on this panel. Two things. I'll talk at the tactical level and then I'll talk at the big picture level.

00:38:25:10 - 00:38:45:11
不明
At a tactical level, it goes back to the first bullet you had in terms of driving growth. What is the outcome? I'm trying to drive. Right. If I had all the technology I had, what would I do? What kind of experiences would I drive? Because that's what creates value, whether it's top line growth or doing something faster, cheaper, better.

00:38:45:16 - 00:39:08:46
不明
So that's the tactical answer. Like it's not capabilities, it's not the specific technology, but what are you going to do about it. So bias for action, whether it's partnering with a genetic AI or doing it in an entrepreneurial tiny experiment and launching it at scale. Now, what is really happening in the world of marketing? I'm going to piggyback on Nikki's.

00:39:08:51 - 00:39:38:09
不明
You know, experiences are not just a CMO or a CEO sort of function. It is everybody's role, right? It becomes a CEO first involved. A brand president is involved. A chief customer officer is involved. See, in us it's hey, John, officers are involved because I need to uplevel my my workforce. So it is becoming a much more of an enterprise level sort of an opportunity and to serve that.

00:39:38:22 - 00:40:03:36
不明
Adobe has an enterprise platform so they don't have to when enterprises are looking to reinvent whether they are looking to build another ecosystem, right. They want a technology partner. They don't want a technology vendor. They want somebody that, hey, I with a C technology partner and us, let's do some magic. So going back to your point on ecosystems and that's emerging.

00:40:03:36 - 00:40:27:09
不明
That's a very different way of thinking. So that's really really important from my perspective. And that's great. And maybe it just to to build on that back to you Nathan. Now you know you talk about so obviously making that transformative leap, focus on outcomes, focus on value creation, making sure it's a team sport is also has a set set of challenges.

00:40:27:09 - 00:40:55:09
不明
You're kind of in the throes of every one of us is in the throes of kind of driving that transformative agenda. Curious from your perspective, like, what are some of the challenges that you think technologists and marketers face today, and any thoughts on how we should think about addressing those as we undertake that journey? I think, the the organizational overlap or the need for organizational collaboration to drive is emerging, as you said.

00:40:55:13 - 00:41:16:59
不明
Karthik. From our vantage point, it's something we're directly trying to address through our technology ecosystem as well. You know, typically, you know, you have separate organizations for sale, stag left and, you know, they call it started calling them sales stack to reflect that, changed two years back, laid martech has always been around and now they're back.

00:41:17:04 - 00:41:40:06
不明
And so I think, I think we need to, from, from my vantage point is really around driving consolidation of your customer facing personalization platforms. And behind the scenes, I would say with that centralization, you can actually drive the unified customer experience across domains, across organized actions. So it's very essential you might not be able to consolidate all your technology.

00:41:40:12 - 00:42:01:12
不明
It's like, you know, it's like a dream, like unicorn. I think if you can create the last mile personalization system consolidation. And what I mean by that is your customer journey orchestration, you probably don't need a separate system for marketing email to goal versus sales email. The goal, even if you have that, you can orchestrate those experiences with some consensus, right?

00:42:01:17 - 00:42:28:00
不明
I think that's one area where that's a challenge, and that's how we're thinking about solving that as well. The other thing is adoption. I think adoption is not talked about a lot. We've talked about, you know, leaps and bounds of AI, impact. But what is really the biggest barrier is adoption. So it's funny, like last week, I was at a tech conference and we were in a panel and, you know, we were talking about, hey, what do you think is the killer app for AI generative AI?

00:42:28:04 - 00:42:54:49
不明
And half the team said, have the members in the room, said it's productivity, you know, amplified. Another half said, oh, it's personalization. And I said, hey, the killer app is adoption. If you can get adoption to critical mass of these technologies, then you will unlock the value. So I think the challenge that we the face is the, I would say under emphasis of adoption, and the solution is to have fair investments in those programs.

00:42:54:54 - 00:43:13:59
不明
And also, you know, like a lot of times when we think about building solutions for our customers and our front lines, you know, there's this HQ versus the end user, you know, distance. We have to cross that distance. We have to embed ourselves in the frontline. We have to embed ourselves in, in the in the voice of the customer.

00:43:14:04 - 00:43:48:42
不明
And that is a practice that you have to build. Otherwise it will be, you know, so that's I think, a big solution from an adoption perspective. That's great. Max, I'm going to come back to you. So we had a lot of these things. So as you're kind of undertaking this transformative journey, what tactical advice would you give your fellow marketing customer experience, data practitioners, or growth practitioners, around how they should think about doing that as they kind of and where should they start?

00:43:48:46 - 00:44:07:04
不明
So, you know, I'm like a factory guy already at this point. But I'm also like a little history buff. So the era of managerial capitalism, the US goes back to about 1920. It's when like companies went from being like family owned and family run to the belief that the scale and the complexity required, like real levels of expertise.

00:44:07:19 - 00:44:28:21
不明
The first job to turn, for the most part, was finance. And like the forecasting, was invented to give rise to modern consulting. But the second one was essentially marketing. And so marketing in that way, for over a hundred years has been the like marketing done well has been the doorway in the door, you know, the entrance for innovation for so many things.

00:44:28:26 - 00:44:54:27
不明
The companies have adopted both the professionalization of work, thinking about new and innovative growth models. It's given rise to chief data officers, of which I was one chief growth officers, chief digital officers. So it's really like this core kind of in the family tree of of like important jobs and economic development. So I would argue that that era, remains.

00:44:54:32 - 00:45:17:11
不明
And what I see right now, the troubles me and the data and the research is that, I just prepared for like, a keynote. So I've got some more stats fresh in my head. Something like 86% of our customers are experimenting with gen AI in some way, shape or form. So it's like almost 90% and yet an equal number have no training, no guidelines, no cross-functional collaboration on it.

00:45:17:11 - 00:45:37:30
不明
And so when you think about the implications of that, it's like you've let a thousand flowers bloom, but then you're trying to run a data strategy alongside it. You know, there's just you know, you're getting like functional point improvements and it feels more comfortable because it's like you can kind of nest it inside. You're like strategy and planning person and you know, or whoever when, wherever.

00:45:37:30 - 00:45:57:37
不明
But like I would argue to answer your question with that background, that marketers need to be bolder than ever, and that those that are not are going to have a lot of time available because they won't be marketers for long. So I think the scale, there's a relationship between the scale at which you adopt AI and scales, as you mentioned.

00:45:57:37 - 00:46:22:57
不明
Right? You may start small, but in particular at the nexus of finance marketing and go to market and sales. That I think is an appropriate level at which to think about how you do things like and then pipeline management, how you understand demand at a very fine grain in the enterprise context. That would be like at the sub, not parent level, how you pick up signal, you know, even if the, contact is unknown and build a great data strategy.

00:46:23:02 - 00:46:40:37
不明
So I think it's time for marketers to be brave. You've got to go big on AI, and the costs of not doing that are going to be huge. You're going to lose compounding advantage, and you need to lead the way for the company as a whole. It's awesome. Nick, maybe a question for you on this because you're the voice of the industry.

00:46:40:42 - 00:47:11:17
不明
The the 2000 plus CMAs. Many of us in this audience, actually, they are a key stakeholder, whether we on the technology side or are on the marketing side, brand side, etc.. What do you know? What piece of advice would you give the audience over here and how, you know, how should they engage with this CMO to help their agenda and be a part of that transformation that they and that they need to kind of undertake being bolder?

00:47:11:22 - 00:47:36:54
不明
Yeah, I think it's I'll say it maybe, instead of bold, which still is necessary. I think it's, we need to be more, let's say, desperate. I mean that in a positive way. And or and not in a, I mean, like Covid, right? Remember, Covid, we just got shit done together with the organization. We didn't use PowerPoints.

00:47:36:59 - 00:48:11:04
不明
We didn't go on a three year plan of reinvention. You mentioned what was it like 39, 45% of CEOs think they need to reinvent, 100% of CEOs reinvented their stuff, and marketing was at the table. They weren't like in a different room. They were at the table representing the customer. Were were they talking about creating value, whatever that was for your organization, even if it wasn't a product that you were selling at the time, it was creating value in a way that was unique to your organization and marketing was there representing the needs of the customer.

00:48:11:04 - 00:48:36:03
不明
The insights of the customer, talking to the supply chain, talking to engineering, talking to service in other countries in here and the employees. Right. And so marketing has to kind of recapture that, not desperation. But you know, we're we're we're down by two. It's the fourth quarter and there's like a minute left on the clock. Right. And that's what we have to sort of act like.

00:48:36:03 - 00:49:04:50
不明
It's a team sport, for sure, but just get going versus trying to keep up with the technology. Right. If you have that, that that eye on the prize and you're in it to win it, then the technologies that help you do that and you have to obviously adopt the technology because you're consumers are, but you have to do it in a way that's going to help you win versus just trying to keep up with the technology, because frankly, that's impossible.

00:49:04:55 - 00:49:26:42
不明
So set it up so good. I think I was saying set another way, just burn the bots. Get get get going. Yeah, yeah. And, adopt the, adopt the technology along the way, but, you know that that shouldn't be, you know, 35, 40% of the, of CIOs are looking to reinvent at some point, they're they're going to be reinvented, whether they, whether they're on the path or not.

00:49:26:42 - 00:49:49:05
不明
So, let's, let's embrace it. Let's embrace the importance of marketing's role in that equation, like we did for a few months or even a year, you know, during the, during Covid times. Got to. You want to say something? Yeah. I know we talked a lot about technology and experiences and whatnot, but I think about change.

00:49:49:10 - 00:50:11:54
不明
Change starts with you, right? You don't expect organizations to change. When you can't change, you got to let go of your old processes, let go of all limiting beliefs, and be the leader of change. They can begin to combine some of the comments here. Nick said, just do it. Get it done right. If I think about Edison, right, he didn't come up with the bulb right away.

00:50:11:59 - 00:50:37:57
不明
He had like 9000 plus failures before he invented the bulb. So you got to fail, fail fast, fail early, experiment, and then figure out how to scale from there. Right. And I like Max's point. You're gonna think bold. Hey, marketing is not about email anymore. It's about growth. Your company's lifeline is on marketing, right? So if you put yourself as a GM, as a business owner, what would you do?

00:50:38:02 - 00:51:05:13
不明
Right? I think that's at the heart of it is you are the change. You drive the change. Yes. Companies, processes. Technology is not perfect. I haven't seen one company that is perfect, but how to navigate that is really important. Well all right so we're going to do a quick rapid fire right. This one's for everyone. So we're going to go across I'm going to ask you as to when 2020 5th March.

00:51:05:18 - 00:51:32:18
不明
What is the one technology or one trend that most excites you about 2025 as a marketer, as a growth leader? So I'll start left right. Nick. I think it's a, a tech now. It's not so much technology as a way of working. It's the, on your performance reviews. You should all have an A-plus on works well with others, because that's what marketing is, and that's what it takes to win.

00:51:32:18 - 00:52:07:12
不明
And then technology obviously enables that. It binds it all together. But marketing has to operationally, organizationally and obviously, professionally work well with the organization to be the glue that's going to create the value for the consumer. I think for me, I kind of mentioned like, at at a professional level is really around like giving the super power back to our marketers and having them unleash 3 or 4 levels of productivity, really operate on massive scale, and optimize at a massive scale.

00:52:07:17 - 00:52:30:32
不明
I think at a personal level, and even from an ecosystem standpoint, I think this super power is for us to embrace. I mean, you know, I talk about the impact of technology, even in personal life, that kind of gives you the ideas and give gets you comfortable with the change. I mean, how even in our personal lives, we can now very quickly summarize information, how can we very quickly, you know, research, you know, any, any topic for that matter.

00:52:30:32 - 00:52:58:45
不明
Right? You know, there used to be an ad about standard Holiday Inn Express last night. I don't know if you guys remember a few years back. I mean, that's real. Like, you could become, a deep expert in a domain very quickly, much faster. So I think that that whole ability for you to learn and grasp and consume new ideas and new information is something that I'm very excited about for me, for my family, for my kids, for my peer workers and also my stakeholders.

00:52:58:49 - 00:53:27:29
不明
Can I just get the flip side of that before you get the max, which is if you're not doing that, you're an opportunity cost for your company. It's too important not to do that. And that's not a nice thing to do. You're representing not just yourselves, but your teams internally and your agencies as a, is that force multiplier for growth if you're not leading the way on that, doing everything you just said, you're an opportunity cost and, that's, that's it's too important for that.

00:53:27:34 - 00:53:47:58
不明
So what I'm, you know, very consistent with the things that I'm most excited about, right? Is that all of us in this room are gonna be on one side of this in 2025, right? Either you go big and you go brave, and you go bold, and you take the risk at times and you start to mold your organizations in a way that they can work.

00:53:48:03 - 00:54:09:36
不明
And you integrate the I into the workflows. Right. That seems to be really, really, really like back to the adoption is a killer app, right? It like or you don't and it gets it's gonna get harder to make that change. If you think about the world that's ahead of you like, yeah, I could say I'm really excited about like a genetic and a genetic orchestration.

00:54:09:36 - 00:54:36:23
不明
But like, the reality is like there's lots of the genetic orchestrators inside a company, potentially like marketing and selling to other agents outside the company. Like, like, how do you deal with that? Right. And so being at the forefront of these, like big like philosophical transformational questions that affect not just how do we market, not just how we sell, not just how we engage customers, not just how jobs are created, but like, what's the future of human labor?

00:54:36:37 - 00:55:06:18
不明
Like, these are giant and important questions, and you all get to be at the front seat of that. If you make the bold moves. Right. So I think from an anthropological historical perspective, you are in a really, really, really interesting time. But it does require boldness. Even as we live in a world that is fragmented, where there's a lot of fear, a lot of concern, where some parts of what we're working on are deflationary and our job creating, like there's a lot of sportiness to this, but you are at the forefront of it.
